The Iranian hacking group known as MuddyWater (aka Earth Vetala, Mango Sandstorm, and MUDDYCOAST) has targeted several organizations and individuals mainly located across the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region as part of a new campaign codenamed Operation Olalampo.

The activity, first observed on January 26, 2026, has resulted in the deployment of new malware families that share overlapping samples previously identified as used by the threat actor, according to a report published by Group-IB. These include downloaders like GhostFetch and HTTP_VIP, along with a Rust backdoor called CHAR and an advanced implant codenamed GhostBackDoor that's dropped by GhostFetch.

"These attacks follow similar patterns and align with the killchains previously observed in MuddyWater attacks; starting with a phishing email with a Microsoft Office document attached to it that contains malicious macro code that decodes the embedded payload and drops it on the system and executes it, providing the adversary with remote control of the system," the company said.

One such attack chain employing a malicious Microsoft Excel document prompts users to enable macros in order to activate the infection and ultimately drop CHAR. Another variant of the same attack has been found to lead to the deployment of the GhostFetch downloader, which then downloads GhostBackDoor.

A third version of the attack leverages themes such as flight tickets and reports, in contrast to using lures mimicking an energy and marine services company in the Middle East, to distribute the HTTP_VIP downloader that subsequently deploys the AnyDesk remote desktop software.

A brief description of the four tools is as follows -

GhostFetch, a first-stage downloader that profiles the system, validates mouse movements and checks screen resolution, checks for the presence of debuggers, virtual machine artifacts, and antivirus software, and fetches and executes secondary payloads directly in memory.

GhostBackDoor, a second-stage backdoor delivered by GhostFetch that supports an interactive shell, file read/write, and re-run GhostFetch.

HTTP_VIP, a native downloader that conducts system reconnaissance, connects to an external server ("codefusiontech[.]org") to authenticate and deploy AnyDesk from the C2 server. A new variant of the malware also adds the ability to retrieve victim information and retrieve instructions to start an interactive shell, download/upload files, capture clipboard contents, and update the sleep/beaconing interval.

CHAR, a Rust backdoor that's controlled by a Telegram bot (whose first name is "Olalampo" and username is "stager_51_bot") to change directory and execute a cmd.exe or PowerShell command.

The PowerShell command is designed to execute a SOCKS5 reverse proxy or another backdoor named Kalim, upload data stolen from web browsers, and run unknown executables referred to as "sh.exe" and "gshdoc_release_X64_GUI.exe."

Group-IB's analysis of CHAR's source code has revealed signs of artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted development owing to the presence of emojis in debug strings, a finding that's consistent with Google's revelations last year that the threat actor is experimenting with generative AI tools to support the development of custom malware to support file transfer and remote execution.

Another notable aspect is that CHAR shares a similar structure and development environment as the Rust-based malware BlackBeard (aka Archer RAT and RUSTRIC), which was flagged by CloudSEK and Seqrite Labs as put to use by the threat actor to target various entities in the Middle East.

MuddyWater has also been observed exploiting recently disclosed vulnerabilities on public-facing servers as a way to obtain initial access to target networks.

"The MuddyWater APT group remains an active threat within the META [Middle East, Turkey, and Africa] region, with this operation primarily targeting organizations in the MENA region," Group-IB concluded. "The group's continued adoption of AI technology, combined with continued development of custom malware and tooling and diversified command-and-control (C2) infrastructures, underscores their dedication and intent to expand their operations."

[2] BleepingComputer - Arkanix Stealer pops up as short-lived AI info-stealer experiment
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[TAM METİN - 534 kelime]
An information-stealing malware operation named Arkanix Stealer, promoted on multiple dark web forums towards the end of 2025, was likely developed as an AI-assisted experiment.

The project included a control panel and a Discord server for communication with users, but the author took them down without notification, just two months after the operation began.

Arkanix offered many of the standard data-stealing features that cybercriminals are used to, along with a modular architecture and anti-analysis features.

Kaspersky researchers analyzed the Arkanix stealer and found clues indicating LLM-assisted development, which "might have drastically reduced development time and costs."

The researchers believe that Arkanix was a short-lived project for quick financial gains, which makes detection and tracking much more difficult.

Arkanix appears online

Arkanix started being promoted on hacker forums in October 2025, offering two tiers to potential customers: a basic level with a Python-based implementation, and a “premium” one with a native C++ payload using VMProtect protection, integrating AV evasion and wallet injection features.

The developer set up a Discord server that acted as a forum for the community around the project to receive updates, provide feedback for proposed features, and receive help.

Also, a referral program was established to promote the project more aggressively, giving referrers an extra free hour of premium access, while potential new customers received one week of free access to the “premium” version.

Data-stealing capabilities

Additionally, the malware can steal data from Telegram, steal Discord credentials, spread via the Discord API, and send messages to the victim’s friends/channels.

Arkanix also targets credentials for Mullvad, NordVPN, ExpressVPN, and ProtonVPN, and can archive files from the local filesystem to exfiltrate them asynchronously.

Additional modules that can be downloaded from the command-and-control include a Chrome grabber, a wallet patcher for Exodus or Atomic, a screenshots tool, HVNC, and stealers for FileZilla and Steam.

The “premium” native C++ version adds RDP credential theft, anti-sandbox and anti-debugging checks, WinAPI-powered screen capturing, and also targets Epic Games, Battle.net, Riot, Unreal Engine, Ubisoft Connect, and GOG.

The higher-tier variant also delivers the ChromElevator post-exploitation tool, which injects into suspended browser processes for data theft and is designed to bypass Google's App-Bound Encryption (ABE) protection for unauthorized access to user credentials.

The purpose of the Arkanix stealer experiment remains unclear. The project may be an attempt to determine how LLM assistance can improve malware development and how quickly new features can be shipped to the community.

Kaspersky's assessment is that Arkanix is "more of a public software product than a shady stealer."

The researchers provide a comprehensive list of indicators of compromise (IoCs) that include hashes for detected files, along with domains and IP addresses.

[TAM METİN - 411 kelime]
Anthropic has introduced Claude Code Security, a new AI-powered service designed to scan software codebases for vulnerabilities and recommend fixes. Built into Claude Code, the tool aims to help teams detect and remediate security flaws faster. The capability is currently being rolled out in a limited research preview for Enterprise and Team customers.

“Claude Code Security, a new capability built into Claude Code on the web, is now available in a limited research preview. It scans codebases for security vulnerabilities and suggests targeted software patches for human review, allowing teams to find and fix security issues that traditional methods often miss.” reads the announcement published by Anthropic.

Claude Code Security is designed to discover complex, high-severity software vulnerabilities. Unlike traditional rule-based scanners, it analyzes code like a human researcher, focusing on data flows, understanding component interactions, and catching issues others miss. Each finding undergoes multi-stage verification, is assigned a severity and confidence rating, and appears in a dashboard for human review.

“Every finding goes through a multi-stage verification process before it reaches an analyst. Claude re-examines each result, attempting to prove or disprove its own findings and filter out false positives.” continues the announcement. “Findings are also assigned severity ratings so teams can focus on the most important fixes first.”

Currently in limited research preview for Enterprise, Team, and open-source maintainers, it empowers defenders while ensuring responsible deployment.

Claude Code Security leverages over a year of research into Claude’s cybersecurity skills. Tested in Capture-the-Flag events and in partnership with Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Claude has been refined to detect and patch real vulnerabilities. Using Claude Opus 4.6, the team discovered 500+ long-undetected bugs in open-source projects. Now, Claude Code Security brings these defensive capabilities to Enterprise, Team, and open-source maintainers, letting teams review findings and iterate on fixes directly within familiar tools.

“This is a pivotal time for cybersecurity. We expect that a significant share of the world’s code will be scanned by AI in the near future, given how effective models have become at finding long-hidden bugs and security issues.” concludes Anthropic. “Attackers will use AI to find exploitable weaknesses faster than ever. But defenders who move quickly can find those same weaknesses, patch them, and reduce the risk of an attack.”

Anthropic is launching a limited research preview of Claude Code Security for Enterprise and Team customers, with early access and collaboration. Open-source maintainers can apply for free, expedited access.

Spanish police arrested a 20-year-old man in Madrid after allegedly manipulating the online payment system of a travel and hotel booking website to secure luxury hotel stays for just €0.01 per reservation. The scheme allowed him to book rooms costing up to €1,000 per night, causing more than €20,000 in losses to one hotel alone.

“He manipulated the online payment system and obtained reservations at high -end hotels , costing up to 1,000 euros per night, for minimal prices” reads the press release published by the Spanish National Police.

The investigation began on February 2 after a travel agency reported suspicious bookings on its website. Investigators found the suspect had sabotaged the integrated payment gateway, selecting a well-known international payment platform and launching a tailored cyberattack to alter the transaction validation process.

“The cybercriminal sabotaged the payment gateway system integrated into a hotel booking website. To do this, he selected the payment option through a well-known international electronic payment platform and, using a specifically designed cyberattack, altered the transaction validation process, causing the system to authorize the operation after entering only one cent.” continues the press release.

The system approved reservations as fully paid, while only one cent per booking was actually transferred. The fraud surfaced days later when the company received the minimal payments, revealing losses of about €20,000 in what police say is a previously unseen modus operandi.

After a detailed technical analysis, the police identified the suspect within just four days and arrested him while he was staying at a luxury hotel in Madrid. He had allegedly booked four nights at €1,000 per night and even consumed minibar items, leaving unpaid charges at some hotels. He was brought before judicial authorities on suspicion of computer fraud, and the investigation is still ongoing.

[7] The Register - Attacker gets into France's database listing all bank accounts, makes off with 1.2 million records

Attacker gets into France's database listing all bank accounts, makes off with 1.2 million records

PLUS: Unpatched Ivanti boxes under attack; 0APT might not be a scam; AI gets better at helping cyber-scum; And more

Infosec In Brief An unknown attacker accessed the French government’s database listing every bank account in the country and made off with 1.2 million records.

France’s Ministry of Economics, Finance and Industrial and Digital Sovereignty last week revealed the incident took place in January, after unknown attackers used stolen credentials to access the database.

The Ministry said the attacker's access was restricted immediately upon discovery of the attack, but that the miscreant still managed to access personal information about 1.2 million accounts, including account numbers, account holder’s addresses, and tax identification numbers.

France’s government has mobilized the agencies that fight this sort of incident, and warned account holders to be on the lookout for suspicious messages.

0days in Ivanti's EPMM under attack

Palo Alto Networks' Unit 42 reported last week that the pair of zero-days in Ivanti Endpoint Manager for Mobile (EPMM) that the vendor patched last month are proving popular with attackers.

According to Unit 42 researchers, cyber-scum are aware of the two 9.8-rated CVEs – CVE-2026-1281 and CVE-2026-1340 – and are targeting unpatched systems.

State and local governments, healthcare, manufacturing, professional and legal services, and the tech sector in the US, Germany, Australia, and Canada have all been peppered by attackers leveraging those vulnerabilities.

Unit 42 reports that attackers have tried to exploit them by establishing a reverse shell, installing web shells, downloading malware, and conducting reconnaissance in a search for further vulnerabilities.

The researchers noted that patches are available for both vulnerabilities and point out that installation doesn’t require downtime, so deserves a prominent place on owners’ to-do lists.

0APT a hoax? Not so fast, say researchers

You may recall in last week's security roundup that we wrote about GuidePoint Security’s opinion that a group calling itself 0APT appears to be a fake gang using other cybercriminals' ill-gotten data to pass off as their own.

Researchers with security firm Cyderes' Howler Cell threat research team reached out to warn us not to ignore the group, as there are signs it's a real threat.

According to Howler Cell's research, 0APT's initial presence might be mostly fake, but "the operators behind 0APT are running an active Ransomware-as-a-service platform with functional malicious payloads and a working affiliate model."

Howler Cell warns that the bluff may have been an attempt to attract attention, like we said, but not just to scam victims – they may also be trying to attract affiliates by making quick reputation gains.

Howler Cell said that it managed to access the group's ransomware-as-a-service portal, collecting malware samples that were fully viable and just waiting to be deployed.

"The 0APT ransomware demonstrates a clear focus on reliability, operator configurability, and secure cryptographic implementation, aligning with modern trends in Rust‑based ransomware development," Howler Cell said.

Telcos aren't saying how they fought back against China's Salt Typhoon attacks

Open-source AI is a global security nightmare waiting to happen, say researchers

Pwn2Own Automotive 2026 uncovers 76 zero-days, pays out more than $1M

AI helps cybercrims move faster, do more

AI is rapidly becoming a cybercriminal's best friend, serving as a force multiplier that is increasing attacker success rates at each stage of a campaign.

Unit 42 said in its 2026 Global Incident Response Report published last week that AI contributed to a quadrupling of exfiltration speeds in 2025, making it one of the most dangerous emerging threats for the coming year.

"AI is changing the economics of intrusions," Unit 42 said in the report. "It increases attacker speed, scale and effectiveness while opening entirely new attack vectors."

We've known that AI has helped cybercriminals for a while. Unit 42's report, however, suggests whatever trends we've seen to date are only going to accelerate and make the problem worse.

AI is enabling attackers to move faster to exploit vulnerabilities, with Unit 42 saying it has seen signs that attackers are using AI to help them scan for exposed vulnerabilities within 15 minutes of a CVE being announced.

"Exploitation attempts often begin before many security teams have even finished reading the vulnerability advisory," Unit 42 noted. AI assistance has meant that time-to-exfiltration can be as little as 25 minutes, according to Unit 42's simulations.

AI is further lowering the barrier to entry for new attackers too, by making it easy to personalize social engineering exploits and keeping them free of the spelling and grammar errors that betray their nature.

Constant vigilance and a new line of defenses will be needed to keep up with this latest generation of AI threats, tips for which are included in the Unit 42 report.

Tenga leaks customer details

Sex toy manufacturer Tenga said a "limited segment" of its US customer base who interacted with company support reps have had their details spilled.

Cybercriminals obtained correspondence history and customer email addresses (no other PII or financial information, but even that limited bit of data could get embarrassing) by probing a single employee's email account, the company said.

It seems a malicious email campaign may also be involved using the addresses obtained by the digi-crook, as Tenga is also warning customers caught in the leak not to open suspicious attachments.

The company said it's already been in touch with affected customers, and said it intends to use more protection to prevent another such incident in the future. ®

13 ways attackers use generative AI to exploit your systems

Cybercriminals are increasingly exploiting gen AI technologies to enhance the sophistication and efficiency of their attacks.

Artificial intelligence is revolutionizing the technology industry and this is equally true for the cybercrime ecosystem, as cybercriminals are increasingly leveraging generative AI to improve their tactics, techniques, and procedures and deliver faster, stronger, and sneakier attacks.

As with legitimate use of emerging AI tools, abuse of generative AI for nefarious ends thus far hasn’t been so much about the novel and unseen as it has been about productivity and efficiency, lowering the barrier to entry, and offloading automatable tasks in favor of higher-order thinking on the part of the humans involved.

“AI doesn’t necessarily result in new types of cybercrimes, and instead enables the means to accelerate or scale existing crimes we are familiar with, as well as introduce new threat vectors,” Dr. Peter Garraghan, CEO/CTO of AI security testing vendor Mindgard and a professor at the UK’s Lancaster University, tells CSO. “If a legitimate user can find utility in using AI to automate their tasks, capture complex patterns, lower the barrier of technical entry, reduced costs, and generate new content, why wouldn’t a criminal do the same?”

But the advent of agentic AI is beginning to change things, with AI tools no longer just assisting attackers but helping them automate operations.

“The most significant shift over the past year has been AI’s evolution from a simple ‘helper’ toward becoming a fully autonomous, and quite literally an attacker’s partner-in-crime, capable of executing entire attack chains,” says Crystal Morin, senior cybersecurity strategist at cloud-native security and visibility vendor Sysdig.

Here is a look at various ways cybercriminals are putting gen AI to use in exploiting enterprise systems today.

Taking phishing to the next level

Gen AI enables the creation of highly convincing phishing emails, greatly increasingly the likelihood of prospective marks giving over sensitive information to scam sites or downloading malware.

Instead of sending generic, unconvincing, and error-ridden emails, cybercriminals can leverage AI to quickly generate more sophisticated, personalized, and legitimate-looking emails to target specific recipients.

Gen AI tools help enrich phishing campaigns by pulling together wide-ranging sources of data, including targeted information gleaned from social media.

“AI can be used to quickly learn what types of emails are being rejected or opened, and in turn modify its approach to increase phishing success rate,” Mindgard’s Garraghan explains.

Facilitating malware development

AI can also be used to generate more sophisticated — or less labour-intensive — malware.

For example, cybercriminals are using gen AI to create malicious HTML documents. The XWorm attack, initiated by HTML smuggling, which contains malicious code that downloads and runs the malware, bears the hallmarks of development via AI.

“The loader’s detailed line-by-line description suggesting it was crafted using generative AI,” according to HP Wolf Security’s 2025 Threat Insights Report.

In addition, the “design of the HTML webpage delivering XWorm is almost visually identical as the output from ChatGPT 4o after prompting the LLM to generate an HTML page that offers a file download,” HP Wolf Security added in its report.

Elsewhere, ransomware group FunkSec — an Algeria-linked ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operator that takes advantage of double-extortion tactics — has begun harnessing AI technologies, according to Check Point Research.

“FunkSec operators appear to use AI-assisted malware development, which can enable even inexperienced actors to quickly produce and refine advanced tools,” Check Point researchers wrote in a blog post.

Accelerating vulnerability hunting and exploits

Analyzing systems for vulnerabilities and developing exploits can also be simplified through use of gen AI.

“Instead of a black hat hacker spending the time to probe and perform reconnaissance against a system perimeter, an AI agent can be tasked to do this automatically,” Mingard’s Garraghan says.

Gen AI may be behind a 62% reduction in the time between a vulnerability being discovered and its exploitation by attackers from 47 days to just 18 days, according to a study last year by threat intelligence firm ReliaQuest.

“This sharp decrease strongly indicates that a major technological advancement — likely gen AI — is enabling threat actors to exploit vulnerabilities at unprecedented speeds,” ReliaQuest wrote.

Adversaries are leveraging gen AI alongside pen-testing tools to write scripts for tasks such as network scanning, privilege escalation, and payload customization. AI is also likely being used by cybercriminals to analyze scan results and suggest optimal exploits, allowing them to identify flaws in victim systems faster.

“These advances accelerate many phases in the kill chain, particularly initial access,” ReliaQuest concluded.

Cyber resilience firm Cybermindr used a different methodology to find that the average time to exploit a vulnerability had fallen to five days in 2025. “AI-driven reconnaissance, automated attack scripts, and underground exploit marketplaces have accelerated the weaponization of vulnerabilities,” it said.

CSO’s Lucian Constantin offers a deeper look at how generative AI tools are transforming the cyber threat landscape by democratizing vulnerability hunting for pen-testers and attackers alike.

Launching AI-orchestrated espionage

Anthropic dropped a bombshell in September 2025 when it revealed that it had disrupted a sophisticated AI-orchestrated cyber espionage campaign.

The attackers abused Claude Code to automate approximately 80% of their campaign activities, targeting around 30 major tech firms, financial institutions, and government agencies.

In a “small number of cases” attacks were successful, according to the AI company, noting that an unnamed “Chinese state-sponsored group” was likely behind the campaign, which relied on jailbreaking tools to make prohibited functions possible.

Last year Carnegie Mellon’s CyLab Security & Privacy Institute researchers, in collaboration with Anthropic, demonstrated that LLMs like GPT-4o can autonomously plan and execute sophisticated cyberattacks on enterprise-scale networks — without any human intervention.

“The study reveals that an LLM, when structured with high-level planning capabilities and supported by specialized agent frameworks, can simulate network intrusions and closely mirror real-world breaches,” a CyLab spokesperson explained.

Escalating threats with alternative platforms

Cybercriminals have also begun developing their own large language models (LLMs) — such as WormGPT, FraudGPT, DarkBERT, and others — built without the guardrails that constrain criminals’ misuse of mainstream gen AI platforms.

These platforms are commonly harnessed for applications such as phishing and malware generation.

Moreover, mainstream LLMs can also be customized for targeted use. Security researcher Chris Kubecka shared with CSO in late 2024 how her custom version of ChatGPT, called Zero Day GPT, helped her identify more than 20 zero-days in a matter of months.

Stealing resources via LLMjacking

Threat actors are also busy stealing cloud credentials specifically to hijack costly LLM resources, either for their own gain or to sell access, in an attack technique called LLMjacking.

“Beyond theft of service, attackers are now actively probing newer LLM models to identify those that lack the guardrails of more mature platforms, effectively using them as unrestricted sandboxes to generate malicious code or bypass regional sanctions,” Sysdig’s Morin reports.

Creating a Silk Road–style marketplace for AI agents

Beyond AI agents executing individual attacks, security experts are beginning to track examples where coordination itself is being automated or orchestrated.

“We’re seeing early experiments where multiple specialized agents interact, some focused on reconnaissance, others on tooling, execution, or data movement, without any single agent needing the full picture,” says Lucie Cardiet, cyberthreat research manager at Vectra AI.

A concrete example of this is Molt Road, which offers a dark-web-style marketplace for AI agents, albeit one with few listings at present.

“Autonomous agents can create listings, sell access or capabilities, coordinate tasks, and complete transactions with minimal human involvement, effectively automating the economics of cybercrime,” Cardiet tells CSO.

“We can expect attackers to actively leverage this model in the coming months, breaking the attack chain into specialized, cooperating agents to speed up and scale their attacks,” she says.

Breaking in with authentication bypass

Gen AI tools can also be abused to bypass security defences such as CAPTCHAs or biometric authentication.

“AI can defeat CAPTCHA systems and analyse voice biometrics to compromise authentication,” according to cybersecurity vendor Dispersive. “This capability underscores the need for organizations to adopt more advanced, layered security measures.”

Leveraging deepfakes for social engineering

AI-generated deepfakes are being abused to exploit channels many employees more implicitly trust, such as voice and video, instead of relying on less convincing email-based attacks.

The problem is becoming more severe with the wider availability of AI technologies capable of creating more convincing deepfakes, according to Alex Lisle, CTO of deepfake detection platform Reality Defender.

“There was a recent case involving a cybersecurity company that relied on visual verification for credential resets,” Lisle says. “Their process required a manager to join a Zoom call with IT to confirm an employee’s identity before a password reset.”

Lisle explains: “Attackers are now leveraging deepfakes to impersonate those managers on live video calls to authorize these resets.”

In the most high-profile example to date, a finance worker at design and engineering company Arup was tricked into authorizing a fraudulent HK$200 million ($25.6 million) transaction after attending a videoconference call during which fraudsters used deepfake technology to impersonate its UK-based CFO.

Impersonating brands in malicious ad campaigns

Cybercriminals have begun using gen AI tools to deliver brand impersonation campaigns delivered via ads and content platforms, rather than traditional phishing or malware.

“Attackers now use gen AI to mass-produce realistic ad copy, creatives, and fake support pages, then distribute them across search ads, social ads, and AI-generated content, targeting high-intent queries like ‘brand login’ or ‘brand support,’” explains Shlomi Beer, co-founder and CEO at ImpersonAlly, a security startup that specializes in protecting the online advertising ecosystem.

The tactic was used in ongoing a series of Google Ad account fraud, to impersonate the Cursor AI coding assistant firm, and in a fake Shopify ecommerce platform customer support scam, among other attacks.

Attackers have also begun targeting viral personal AI agents such as OpenClaw.

OpenClaw offers an open-source AI agent framework. A combination of supply chain attacks on its skill marketplace and misconfigurations open the door to potential exploits and malware slinging, as CSO covered in much more depth in our earlier report.

“Cybercriminals can exploit these virtual assistants to steal private keys to cryptocurrency wallets and execute code on victims’ devices,” says Edward Wu, CEO and founder at Dropzone AI. “We can expect 2026 to be the year when security teams will try to prevent unsanctioned usage of personal AI agents.”

Poisoning model memories

To offer short-term and longer-term context, AI agents are starting to rely more on persistent memory, opening the door for exploits that involve planting malicious memories.

If an attacker injects malicious or false information into an agent’s memory, that corrupted context then influences every future decision the agent makes.

For example, security researcher Johann Rehberger showed how he could plant false memories in ChatGPT in September 2025.

“He [Rehberger] used a malicious image with hidden instructions embedded in it to inject fabricated data into the model’s long-term memory,” said Siri Varma Vegiraju, security tech lead at Microsoft. “The scary part was that once the memory was poisoned, it persisted across sessions and continuously exfiltrated user data to a server the attacker controlled.”

Hacking AI infrastructure

Over the past year, attackers have shifted from using generative AI to targeting the infrastructure that enables it.

This vector of attack is exemplified in the supply chain poisoning in Model Context Protocol servers, where compromised dependencies or modified code introduced vulnerabilities into enterprise environments.

For example, a counterfeit “Postmark MCP Server” discovered in early 2025 silently BCC’d all processed emails, including internal documents, invoices, and credentials, to an attacker-controlled domain.

Many other malicious MCP servers have already been identified in the wild, many designed to exfiltrate information without detection, according to Casey Bleeker CEO at SurePath AI.

“We’re tracking several categories of MCP-specific risk: tool poisoning attacks, where adversaries inject malicious instructions into AI tool descriptions that execute when the agent invokes them; supply chain compromises, where a trusted MCP server or dependency is updated post-approval to behave maliciously; and cross-tool data exfiltration, where compromised components in an agentic workflow silently siphon sensitive data through what looks like legitimate AI activity,” Bleeker explains.

AI technologies are powerful but they have their limitations, several experts tell CSO.

Rik Ferguson, VP of security intelligence at Forescout, says cybercriminals are largely relying on AI to automate repetitive tasks rather than more complex work, such as vulnerability exploitation.

“The most reliable criminal use [of AI] remains in language-heavy and workflow-heavy tasks such as phishing and pretexting, influence and outreach, triaging and contextualizing vulnerabilities, and generating boilerplate components, rather than reliably discovering and exploiting brand-new vulnerabilities end-to-end,” Ferguson says.

Over the past twelve months, managed detection and response firm Huntress has tracked threat actors applying AI to generate and automate traditional tradecraft, from developing scripts to browser extensions and, in some cases, even phishing lures.

“We have also seen such ‘vibe coded’ scripts fail to execute and meet their objectives on multiple occasions,” Anton Ovrutsky, principal tactical response analyst at Huntress, tells CSO.

And while AI has certainly given threat actors a powerful tool it has, at least to date, failed to spawn any new tactics or exploit classes, according to Ovrutsky.

“A threat actor can indeed rapidly prototype a sophisticated credential theft script, yet the basic ‘laws of physics’ still exist; a threat actor must be in a position to execute such a script in the first place,” Ovrutsky says. “We have yet to observe an exploit path that has been enabled through AI-use exclusively.”

Collectively the misuse of gen AI tools is making it easier for less skilled cybercriminals to earn a dishonest living. Defending against the attack vector challenges security professionals to harness the power of artificial intelligence more effectively than attackers.

“Criminal misuse of AI technologies is driving the necessity to test, detect, and respond to these threats, in which AI is also being leveraged to combat cybercriminal activity,” Mindgard’s Garraghan says.

In a blog post, Lawrence Pingree, VP of technical marketing at Dispersive, outlines preemptive cyber defenses that security professionals can take to win what he describes as an “AI ARMS (Automation, Reconnaissance, and Misinformation) race” between attackers and defenders.

“Relying on traditional detection and response mechanisms is no longer sufficient,” Pingree warns.

Alongside employee education and awareness programs, enterprises should be using AI to detect and neutralize generative AI-based threats in real-time.

Forescout’s Ferguson says CISOs should treat enterprise AI like any other high-value SaaS platform.

“Tighten identity and conditional access, minimize privileges, lock down keys, and monitor for anomalous AI/API usage and spend,” Ferguson advises.
