Introduction: Steal It Today, Break It in a Decade

Digital evolution is unstoppable, and though the pace may vary, things tend to fall into place sooner rather than later. That, of course, applies to adversaries as well. The rise of ransomware and cyber extortion generated funding for a complex and highly professional criminal ecosystem. The era of the cloud brought general availability of almost infinite amounts of storage. So there is literally nothing that stops criminals from stealing and trafficking heaps of data, be it encrypted or not.

Patient adversaries are employing a "Harvest Now, Decrypt Later" (HNDL) strategy. They are quietly accumulating encrypted data with the intention of decrypting it later using quantum computers. Any data requiring long-term security, such as trade secrets or classified designs, is vulnerable because its lifespan will inevitably outlive its current encryption. Therefore, it is crucial that organizations begin planning their PQC migration now, ensuring that data encrypted today remains secure against future quantum-enabled decryption attacks.

The Quantum Waiting Game

Cryptography is the backbone of digital trust, but the looming era of quantum computing threatens its foundations.

Harnessing quantum physics, future quantum machines will effortlessly break the mathematical encryption schemes that protect data today. Current prototypes [1] are not quite there yet because they fundamentally lack the scale and error-correction capability required to successfully execute complex quantum algorithms. However, the prospect of a mature, cryptographically relevant quantum computer (CRQC) is alarming. Such a machine could likely break modern encryption in a matter of minutes, likely by 2030 to 2035.

To combat the looming quantum computing threat, our cryptography must evolve immediately. This is why Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) [2] is being introduced as a solution. PQC provides new cryptographic algorithms designed to withstand attacks from both today's classical computers and future quantum machines.

A Step-by-Step Guide to Future-Proofing with PQC

PQC migration is a complex process that spans the entire organization and potentially reaches deep into its security architecture. This massive transition is complicated by the current state of industry planning. There is still a lack of consensus in technical literature regarding common steps or uniform terminology for migration strategies. Without a common language, companies find it difficult to effectively compare, adopt, or coordinate the most suitable migration strategies.

Our research concludes that the following strategy offers an effective, universal framework that can be adapted to suit any organization. [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

At this stage, it is important to emphasize that a migration team must be established for each migration. This team should consist of cryptography and cybersecurity experts and managers from the software system or infrastructure being migrated. The team will drive the migration process forward and ensure its completion.

Step 1 (Preparation): This phase establishes the scope and leadership for the PQC migration process. Key activities include assessing the relevance and urgency of PQC, appointing a program lead, aligning stakeholders on clear goals, and initiating conversations with vendors to determine migration needs.

Step 2 (Diagnosis): This phase involves a thorough evaluation of the current cybersecurity posture to establish a comprehensive security baseline. Key activities include documenting all cryptographic assets, categorizing data based on their confidential lifespan, identifying suppliers of cryptographic tools to evaluate their PQC readiness, and conducting a formal risk assessment to generate a prioritized asset list based on principles such as Mosca's theorem [12].

Step 3 (Planning): Once the urgency and scope are determined, this phase focuses on the "how" and "when“. It focuses on the migration strategy, creating a comprehensive business and technical plan and timeline based on the urgency and scope determined in previous steps. Key activities involve appointing a dedicated migration manager to oversee the process and conducting a comprehensive cost estimate for the entire migration.

Step 4 (Execution): This critical phase involves executing the plan to establish a quantum-safe environment through careful technical implementation. Key activities include maintaining backward compatibility via a hybrid cryptographic approach, implementing recommended PQC primitives for key exchange and signatures, adjusting key sizes, and integrating cryptographic agility to ensure rapid adaptation with minimal service disruption.

Step 5 (Continuous Monitoring and Update): This final phase focuses on continuous vigilance after migration, recognizing the dynamic cryptographic landscape. Key activities include routinely reviewing and updating the cryptographic inventory, conducting regular reviews of emerging threats to PQC schemes, performing proactive security audits and vulnerability assessments, and staying updated on the latest PQC advances to ensure timely system and software updates.

Addressing Key Challenges: A Practical Checklist

To ensure a successful PQC migration, organizations must proactively identify and mitigate key obstacles that could hinder progress. They must recognize that the transition involves navigating three interdependent categories of challenges.

Organizational challenges: These non-technical obstacles relate to people, strategic planning, internal governance, and coordination across the wider ecosystem, often complicated by a lack of urgency or qualified personnel.

PQC challenges: These stem directly from the immaturity of the new technology. Although we now have initial standards, such as ML-KEM and its implementation in protocols like TLS, a lack of standardization for a complete suite of algorithms and uncertainty in selecting and testing reliable PQC solutions remain major hurdles. The main issue is the lack of specific implementation guidelines, such as how to effectively deploy hybridization or agility mechanisms.

Code and Documentation challenges: These are technical hurdles caused by the inherent rigidity of existing IT infrastructure (legacy systems), the need for extensive code modification, and the complexity of implementing secure cryptographic changes.

The following breaks down the major obstacles to a successful PQC migration and offers solutions for each. Each obstacle falls under one of the previously established challenge categories. See references [71] and [11] for a more comprehensive discussion of additional obstacles.

Lack of Urgency and Business Case (Organizational):

Problem: The quantum threat seems distant, making it challenging to establish a sense of urgency and budget approval from leadership.

Solution: Organizations can use tools like Mosca's Theorem [12] to quantify their vulnerability and take inventory of cryptographic assets to improve current cybersecurity regardless of the quantum timeline.

Internal Knowledge and Skills Deficit (Organizational):

Problem: Lack of internal knowledge about quantum-based threats, and shortage of qualified personnel to implement new PQC solutions. 
Solution: Launch training initiatives for IT and management. Engage external PQC consultants to design the strategy and knowledge transfer.

[2] The Hacker News - Microsoft Warns Developers of Fake Next.js Job Repos Delivering In-Memory Malware
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Thu, 26 Feb 2026 16:05:00 +0530
Link: https://thehackernews.com/2026/02/fake-nextjs-repos-target-developers.html

[TAM METİN - 1275 kelime]
A "coordinated developer-targeting campaign" is using malicious repositories disguised as legitimate Next.js projects and technical assessments to trick victims into executing them and establish persistent access to compromised machines.

"The activity aligns with a broader cluster of threats that use job-themed lures to blend into routine developer workflows and increase the likelihood of code execution," the Microsoft Defender Security Research Team said in a report published this week.

The tech giant said the campaign is characterized by the use of multiple entry points that lead to the same outcome, where attacker-controlled JavaScript is retrieved at runtime and executed to facilitate command-and-control (C2).

The attacks rely on the threat actors setting up fake repositories on trusted developer platforms like Bitbucket, using names like "Cryptan-Platform-MVP1" to trick developers looking for jobs into running as part of an assessment process.

Further analysis of the identified repositories has uncovered three distinct execution paths that, while triggered in different ways, have the end goal of executing an attacker‑controlled JavaScript directly in memory -

Visual Studio Code workspace execution, where Microsoft Visual Studio Code (VS Code) projects with workspace automation configuration are used to run malicious code retrieved from a Vercel domain as soon as the developer opens and trusts the project. This involves the use of the runOn: "folderOpen" to configure the task.

Build‑time execution during application development, where manually running the development server via "npm run dev" is enough to activate the execution of malicious code embedded within modified JavaScript libraries masquerading as jquery.min.js, causing it to fetch a JavaScript loader hosted on Vercel. The retrieved payload is then executed in memory by Node.js.

Server startup execution via environment exfiltration and dynamic remote code execution, where launching the application backend causes malicious loader logic concealed within a backend module or route file to be executed. The loader transmits the process environment to the external server and executes JavaScript received as a response in memory within the Node.js server process.

Microsoft noted that all three methods lead to the same JavaScript payload that's responsible for profiling the host and periodically polling a registration endpoint to get a unique "instanceId" identifier. This identifier is subsequently supplied in follow-on polls to correlate activity.

It's also capable of executing server-provided JavaScript in memory, ultimately paving the way for a second-stage controller that turns the initial foothold into a persistent access pathway for receiving tasks by contacting a different C2 server and executing them in memory to minimize leaving traces on disk.

"The controller maintains stability and session continuity, posts error telemetry to a reporting endpoint, and includes retry logic for resilience," Microsoft said. "It also tracks spawned processes and can stop managed activity and exit cleanly when instructed. Beyond on-demand code execution, Stage 2 supports operator-driven discovery and exfiltration."

While the Windows maker did not attribute the activity to a specific threat actor, the use of VS Code tasks and Vercel domains to stage malware is a tactic that has been adopted by North Korea-linked hackers associated with a long-running campaign known as Contagious Interview.

The end goal of these efforts is to gain the ability to deliver malware to developer systems, which often contain sensitive data, such as source code, secrets, and credentials, that can provide opportunities to pivot deeper into the target network.

In a report published Wednesday, Abstract Security said it has observed a shift in threat actor tactics, notably a spike in alternative staging servers used in the VS Code tasks commands instead of Vercel URLs. This includes the use of scripts hosted on GitHub gists ("gist.githubusercontent[.]com") to download and run next-stage payloads. An alternative approach employs URL shorteners like short[.]gy to conceal Vercel URLs.

The cybersecurity company said it also identified a malicious npm package linked to the campaign named "eslint-validator" that retrieves and runs an obfuscated payload from a Google Drive URL. The payload in question is a known JavaScript malware referred to as BeaverTail.

Furthermore, a malicious VS Code task embedded within a GitHub repository has been found to initiate a Windows-only infection chain that runs a batch script to download Node.js runtime on the host (if it does not exist) and leverage the certutil program to parse a code block contained within the script. The decoded script is then executed with the previously obtained Node.js runtime to deploy a Python malware protected with PyArmor.

Cybersecurity company Red Asgard, which has also been extensively tracking the campaign, said the threat actors have leveraged crafted VS code projects that use the runOn: "folderOpen" trigger to deploy malware that, in turn, queries the Polygon blockchain to retrieve JavaScript stored within an NFT contract for improved resilience. The final payload is an information stealer that harvests credentials and data from web browsers, cryptocurrency wallets, and password managers.

"This developer‑targeting campaign shows how a recruiting‑themed 'interview project' can quickly become a reliable path to remote code execution by blending into routine developer workflows such as opening a repository, running a development server, or starting a backend," Microsoft concluded.

To counter the threat, the company is recommending that organizations harden developer workflow trust boundaries, enforce strong authentication and conditional access, maintain strict credential hygiene, apply the principle of least privilege to developer accounts and build identities, and separate build infrastructure where feasible.

The development comes as GitLab said it banned 131 unique accounts that were engaged in distributing malicious code projects linked to the Contagious Interview campaign and the fraudulent IT worker scheme known as Wagemole.

"Threat actors typically originated from consumer VPNs when interacting with GitLab.com to distribute malware; however, they also intermittently originated from dedicated VPS infrastructure and likely laptop farm IP addresses," GitLab's Oliver Smith said. "Threat actors created accounts using Gmail email addresses in almost 90% of cases."

In more than 80% of the cases, per the software development platform, the threat actors are said to have leveraged at least six legitimate services to host malware payloads, including JSON Keeper, Mocki, npoint.io, Render, Railway.app, and Vercel. Among these, Vercel was the most commonly used, with the threat actors relying on the web development platform no less than 49 times in 2025.

"In December, we observed a cluster of projects executing malware via VS Code tasks, either piping remote content to a native shell or executing a custom script to decode malware from binary data in a fake font file," Smith added, corroborating the aforementioned findings from Microsoft.

Also discovered by GitLab was a private project "almost certainly" controlled by a North Korean national managing a North Korean IT worker cell that contained detailed financial and personnel records showing earnings of more than $1.64 million between Q1 2022 and Q3 2025. The project included more than 120 spreadsheets, presentations, and documents tracking quarterly income performance for individual team members.

"Records demonstrate that these operations function as structured enterprises with defined targets and operating procedures and close hierarchical oversight," GitLab noted. "This cell's demonstrated ability to cultivate facilitators globally provides a high degree of operational resiliency and money laundering flexibility."

In a report published earlier this month, Okta said the "vast majority" of interviews with IT workers do not progress to a second interview or job offer, but noted they are "learning from their mistakes" and that a large number of them seek temporary contract work as software developers hired out to third-party companies to take advantage of the fact that they are unlikely to enforce rigorous background checks.

"Some actors however seem to be more competent at crafting personas and passing screening interviews," it added. A kind of IT Worker natural selection is at play. The most successful actors are very prolific, and scheduled hundreds of interviews each."

[3] The Hacker News - Malicious StripeApi NuGet Package Mimicked Official Library and Stole API Tokens
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Thu, 26 Feb 2026 15:39:00 +0530

[TAM METİN - 336 kelime]
Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed details of a new malicious package discovered on the NuGet Gallery, impersonating a library from financial services firm Stripe in an attempt to target the financial sector.

The package, codenamed StripeApi.Net, attempts to masquerade as Stripe.net, a legitimate library from Stripe that has over 75 million downloads. It was uploaded by a user named StripePayments on February 16, 2026. The package is no longer available.

"The NuGet page for the malicious package is set up to resemble the official Stripe.net package as closely as possible," ReversingLabs Petar Kirhmajer said. "It uses the same icon as the legitimate package and contains a nearly identical readme, only swapping the 'Stripe.net' references to read 'Stripe-net.'"

In a further effort to lend credibility to the typosquatted package, the threat actor behind the campaign is said to have artificially inflated the download count to more than 180,000. But in an interesting twist, the downloads were split across 506 versions, with each version recording about 300 downloads on average.

The package replicates some of the legitimate Stripe package's functionality, but also modifies certain critical methods to collect and transfer sensitive data, including the user's Stripe API token, back to the threat actor. With the rest of the codebases remaining fully functional, it's unlikely to attract any suspicion from unsuspecting developers who may have inadvertently downloaded it.

ReversingLabs said it discovered and reported the package "relatively soon" after it was initially released, causing it to be taken before it could inflict any serious damage.

The software supply chain security company also noted that the activity marks a shift from prior campaigns that have leveraged bogus NuGet packages to target the cryptocurrency ecosystem and facilitate wallet key theft.

"Developers who mistakenly download and integrate a typosquatted library like StripeAPI.net will still have their applications compile successfully and function as intended," Kirhmajer said. "Payments would process normally and, from the developer’s perspective, nothing would appear broken. In the background, however, sensitive data is being secretly copied and exfiltrated by malicious actors."

[4] The Hacker News - Cisco SD-WAN Zero-Day CVE-2026-20127 Exploited Since 2023 for Admin Access
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Thu, 26 Feb 2026 11:43:00 +0530
Link: https://thehackernews.com/2026/02/cisco-sd-wan-zero-day-cve-2026-20127.html

[TAM METİN - 777 kelime]
A newly disclosed maximum-severity security flaw in Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Controller (formerly vSmart) and Catalyst SD-WAN Manager (formerly vManage) has come under active exploitation in the wild as part of malicious activity that dates back to 2023.

The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2026-20127 (CVSS score: 10.0), allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to bypass authentication and obtain administrative privileges on an affected system by sending a crafted request.

Successful exploitation of the flaw could allow the adversary to obtain elevated privileges and log in to the system as an internal, high-privileged, non-root user account.

"This vulnerability exists because the peering authentication mechanism in an affected system is not working properly," Cisco said in an advisory, adding the threat actor could leverage the non-root user account to access NETCONF and manipulate network configuration for the SD-WAN fabric.

The shortcoming affects the following deployment types, irrespective of the device configuration -

Cisco Hosted SD-WAN Cloud

Cisco Hosted SD-WAN Cloud - Cisco Managed

Cisco Hosted SD-WAN Cloud - FedRAMP Environment

Cisco credited the Australian Signals Directorate's Australian Cyber Security Centre (ASD-ACSC) for reporting the vulnerability. The networking equipment major is tracking the exploitation and subsequent post-compromise activity under the moniker UAT-8616, describing the cluster as a "highly sophisticated cyber threat actor."

The vulnerability has been addressed in the following versions of Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN -

Prior to version 20.91 - Migrate to a fixed release.

Version 20.9 - 20.9.8.2 (Estimated release February 27, 2026)

Version 20.111 - 20.12.6.1

Version 20.12.5 - 20.12.5.3

Version 20.12.6 - 20.12.6.1

Version 20.131 - 20.15.4.2

Version 20.141 - 20.15.4.2

Version 20.15 - 20.15.4.2

Version 20.161 - 20.18.2.1

Version 20.18 - 20.18.2.1

"Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Controller systems that are exposed to the internet and that have ports exposed to the internet are at risk of exposure to compromise," Cisco warned.

The company has also recommended customers to audit the "/var/log/auth.log" file for entries related to "Accepted publickey for vmanage-admin" from unknown or unauthorized IP addresses. It's also advised to check the IP addresses in the auth.log log file against the configured System IPs that are listed in the Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Manager web UI (WebUI > Devices > System IP).

According to information released by the ASD-ACSC, UAT-8616 is said to have compromised Cisco SD-WANs since 2023 via the zero-day exploit, allowing it to gain elevated access.

"The vulnerability allowed a malicious cyber actor to create a rogue peer joined to the network management plane, or control plane, of an organization's SD-WAN," ASD-ACSC said. "The rogue device appears as a new but temporary, actor-controlled SD-WAN component that can conduct trusted actions within the management and control plane."

After successfully compromising a public-facing application, the attackers have been found to leverage the built-in update mechanism to stage a software version downgrade and escalate to the root user by exploiting CVE-2022-20775 (CVSS score: 7.8), a high-severity privilege escalation bug in the CLI of Cisco SD-WAN Software, and then restoring the software back to the version it was originally running.

Some of the subsequent steps initiated by the threat actor are as follows -

Created local user accounts that mimicked other local user accounts.

Added a Secure Shell Protocol (SSH) authorized key for root access and modified SD-WAN-related start-up scripts to customize the environment.

Used Network Configuration Protocol on port 830 (NETCONF) and SSH to connect to/between Cisco SD-WAN appliances within the management plane.

Took steps to clear evidence of the intrusion by purging logs under "/var/log," command history, and network connection history.

"UAT-8616's attempted exploitation indicates a continuing trend of the targeting of network edge devices by cyber threat actors looking to establish persistent footholds into high-value organizations, including Critical Infrastructure (CI) sectors," Talos said.

The development has prompted the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to add both CVE-2022-20775 and CVE-2026-20127 to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, mandating Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to apply the fixes within the next 24 hours.

To check for version downgrade and unexpected reboot events, CISA recommends analyzing the following logs -

/var/volatile/log/vdebug

/var/log/tmplog/vdebug

/var/volatile/log/sw_script_synccdb.log

CISA has also issued a new emergency directive, 26-03: Mitigate Vulnerabilities in Cisco SD-WAN Systems, as part of which federal agencies are required to inventory SD-WAN devices, apply updates, and assess potential compromise.

To that end, agencies have been ordered to provide a catalog of all in-scope SD-WAN systems on their networks by February 26, 2026, 11:59 p.m. ET. Additionally, they are required to submit a detailed inventory of all in-scope products and actions taken by March 5, 2026, 11:59 p.m. ET. Lastly, the agencies will have to submit the list of all steps taken to harden their environments by March 26, 2026, 11:59 p.m. ET.

[5] The Hacker News - Google Disrupts UNC2814 GRIDTIDE Campaign After 53 Breaches Across 42 Countries
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Wed, 25 Feb 2026 23:16:00 +0530

[TAM METİN - 696 kelime]
Google on Wednesday disclosed that it worked with industry partners to disrupt the infrastructure of a suspected China-nexus cyber espionage group tracked as UNC2814 that breached at least 53 organizations across 42 countries.

"This prolific, elusive actor has a long history of targeting international governments and global telecommunications organizations across Africa, Asia, and the Americas," Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) and Mandiant said in a report published today.

UNC2814 is also suspected to be linked to additional infections in more than 20 other nations. The tech giant, which has been tracking the threat actor since 2017, has been observed using API calls to communicate with software-as-a-service (SaaS) apps as command-and-control (C2) infrastructure. The idea, it added, is to disguise their malicious traffic as benign.

Central to the hacking group's operations is a novel backdoor dubbed GRIDTIDE that abuses Google Sheets API as a communication channel to disguise C2 traffic and facilitate the transfer of raw data and shell commands. It's a C-based malware that supports file upload/download and the execution of arbitrary shell commands.

Dan Perez, GTIG researcher, told The Hacker News via email that they cannot confirm if all the intrusions involved the use of the GRIDTIDE backdoor. "We believe many of these organizations have been compromised for years," Perez added.

Exactly how UNC2814 obtains initial access remains a topic of investigation, but the group is said to have a history of exploiting and compromising web servers and edge systems.

Attacks mounted by the threat actor have leveraged a service account to move laterally within the environment via SSH. Also put to use are living-off-the-land (LotL) binaries to conduct reconnaissance, escalate privileges, and set up persistence for the backdoor.

"To achieve persistence, the threat actor created a service for the malware at /etc/systemd/system/xapt.service, and once enabled, a new instance of the malware was spawned from /usr/sbin/xapt," Google explained.

Another noteworthy aspect is the deployment of SoftEther VPN Bridge to establish an outbound encrypted connection to an external IP address. It's worth mentioning here that the abuse of SoftEther VPN has been linked to multiple Chinese hacking groups.

There is evidence indicating that GRIDTIDE is dropped on endpoints containing personally identifiable information (PII), an aspect that's consistent with cyber espionage activity focused on monitoring persons of interest. Google, however, noted that it did not observe any data exfiltration taking place during the course of the campaign.

GRIDTIDE's C2 mechanism involves a cell-based polling mechanism, where specific roles are assigned to certain spreadsheet cells to enable bidirectional communication -

A1, to poll for attacker commands and overwrite it with a status response (e.g., S-C-R or Server-Command-Success)

A2-An, to transfer data, such as command output and files

V1, to store system data from the victim endpoint

As part of the action, Google said it terminated all Google Cloud Projects controlled by the attacker, disabled all known UNC2814 infrastructure, and cut off access to attacker-controlled accounts and Google Sheets API calls leveraged by the actor for command-and-control (C2) purposes.

The tech giant described UNC2814 as one of the "most far-reaching, impactful campaigns" encountered in recent years, adding that it has issued formal victim notifications to each of the targets and that it is actively supporting organizations with verified compromises resulting from this threat.

The latest discovery is one of many concurrent efforts by Chinese nation-state groups to embed themselves into networks for long-term access. The development also highlights that the network edge continues to take the brunt of internet-wide exploitation attempts, with threat actors frequently exploiting vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in such appliances as a common entry point into enterprise networks.

These appliances have become attractive targets in recent years as they typically lack endpoint malware detection, yet provide direct network access or pivot points to internal services if compromised.

"The global scope of UNC2814's activity, evidenced by confirmed or suspected operations in over 70 countries, underscores the serious threat facing telecommunications and government sectors, and the capacity for these intrusions to evade detection by defenders," Google said.

"Prolific intrusions of this scale are generally the result of years of focused effort and will not be easily re-established. We expect that UNC2814 will work hard to re-establish its global footprint."

[6] The Hacker News - Claude Code Flaws Allow Remote Code Execution and API Key Exfiltration
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[TAM METİN - 477 kelime]
Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed multiple security vulnerabilities in Anthropic's Claude Code, an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered coding assistant, that could result in remote code execution and theft of API credentials.

"The vulnerabilities exploit various configuration mechanisms, including Hooks, Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, and environment variables – executing arbitrary shell commands and exfiltrating Anthropic API keys when users clone and open untrusted repositories," Check Point researchers Aviv Donenfeld and Oded Vanunu said in a report shared with The Hacker News.

The identified shortcomings fall under three broad categories -

No CVE (CVSS score: 8.7) - A code injection vulnerability stemming from a user consent bypass when starting Claude Code in a new directory that could result in arbitrary code execution without additional confirmation via untrusted project hooks defined in .claude/settings.json. (Fixed in version 1.0.87 in September 2025)

CVE-2025-59536 (CVSS score: 8.7) - A code injection vulnerability that allows execution of arbitrary shell commands automatically upon tool initialization when a user starts Claude Code in an untrusted directory. (Fixed in version 1.0.111 in October 2025)

CVE-2026-21852 (CVSS score: 5.3) - An information disclosure vulnerability in Claude Code's project-load flow that allows a malicious repository to exfiltrate data, including Anthropic API keys. (Fixed in version 2.0.65 in January 2026)

"If a user started Claude Code in an attacker-controller repository, and the repository included a settings file that set ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL to an attacker-controlled endpoint, Claude Code would issue API requests before showing the trust prompt, including potentially leaking the user's API keys," Anthropic said in an advisory for CVE-2026-21852.

In other words, simply opening a crafted repository is enough to exfiltrate a developer's active API key, redirect authenticated API traffic to external infrastructure, and capture credentials. This, in turn, can permit the attacker to burrow deeper into the victim's AI infrastructure.

This could potentially involve accessing shared project files, modifying/deleting cloud-stored data, uploading malicious content, and even generating unexpected API costs.

Successful exploitation of the first vulnerability could trigger stealthy execution on a developer's machine without any additional interaction beyond launching the project.

CVE-2025-59536 also achieves a similar goal, the main difference being that repository-defined configurations defined through .mcp.json and claude/settings.json file could be exploited by an attacker to override explicit user approval prior to interacting with external tools and services through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This is achieved by setting the "enableAllProjectMcpServers" option to true.

"As AI-powered tools gain the ability to execute commands, initialize external integrations, and initiate network communication autonomously, configuration files effectively become part of the execution layer," Check Point said. "What was once considered operational context now directly influences system behavior."

"This fundamentally alters the threat model. The risk is no longer limited to running untrusted code – it now extends to opening untrusted projects. In AI-driven development environments, the supply chain begins not only with source code, but with the automation layers surrounding it."

[7] The Hacker News - SLH Offers $500–$1,000 Per Call to Recruit Women for IT Help Desk Vishing Attacks
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[TAM METİN - 559 kelime]
The notorious cybercrime collective known as Scattered LAPSUS$ Hunters (SLH) has been observed offering financial incentives to recruit women to pull off social engineering attacks.

The idea is to hire them for voice phishing campaigns targeting IT help desks, Dataminr said in a new threat brief. The group is said to be offering anywhere between $500 and $1,000 upfront per call, in addition to providing them with the necessary pre-written scripts to carry out the attack.

"SLH is diversifying its social engineering pool by specifically recruiting women to conduct vishing attacks, likely to increase the success rate of help desk impersonation," the threat intelligence firm said.

A high-profile cybercrime supergroup comprising LAPSUS$, Scattered Spider, and ShinyHunters, SLH has a record of engaging in advanced social engineering attacks to sidestep multi-factor authentication (MFA) through techniques like MFA prompt bombing and SIM swapping.

The group's modus operandi also involves targeting help desks and call centers to breach companies by posing as employees and convincing them to reset a password or install a remote monitoring and management (RMM) tool that grants them remote access. Once initial access is obtained, Scattered Spider has been observed moving laterally to virtualized environments, escalating privileges, and exfiltrating sensitive corporate data.

Some of these attacks have further led to the deployment of ransomware. Another hallmark of these attacks is the use of legitimate services and residential proxy networks (e.g., Luminati and OxyLabs) to blend in and evade detection. Scattered Spider actors have used various tunneling tools like Ngrok, Teleport, and Pinggy, as well as free file-sharing services such as file.io, gofile.io, mega.nz, and transfer.sh.

In a report published earlier this month, Palo Alto Networks Unit 42, which is tracking Scattered Spider under the moniker Muddled Libra, described the threat actor as "highly proficient at exploiting human psychology" by impersonating employees to attempt password and multi-factor authentication (MFA) resets.

In at least one case investigated by the cybersecurity company in September 2025, Scattered Spider is said to have created and utilized a virtual machine (VM) after obtaining privileged credentials by calling the IT help desk and then used it to conduct reconnaissance (e.g., Active Directory enumeration) and attempt to exfiltrate Outlook mailbox files and data downloaded from the target's Snowflake database.

"While focusing on identity compromise and social engineering, this threat actor leverages legitimate tools and existing infrastructure to blend in," Unit 42 said. "They operate quietly and maintain persistence."

The cybersecurity company also noted that Scattered Spider has an "extensive history" of targeting Microsoft Azure environments using the Graph API to facilitate access to Azure cloud resources. Also put to use by the group are cloud enumeration tools such as ADRecon for Active Directory reconnaissance.

With social engineering emerging as the primary entry point for the cybercrime group, organizations are advised to be on alert and train IT help desk and support personnel to watch out for pre-written scripts and polished voice impersonation, enforce strict identity verification, harden MFA policies by shifting away from SMS-based authentication, and audit logs for new user creation or administrative privilege escalation following help desk interactions.

"This recruitment drive represents a calculated evolution in SLH's tactics," Dataminr said. "By specifically seeking female voices, the group likely aims to bypass the 'traditional' profiles of attackers that IT help desk staff may be trained to identify, thereby increasing the effectiveness of their impersonation efforts."

[8] The Hacker News - Top 5 Ways Broken Triage Increases Business Risk Instead of Reducing It
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Wed, 25 Feb 2026 20:00:00 +0530

[TAM METİN - 1078 kelime]
Triage is supposed to make things simpler. In a lot of teams, it does the opposite.

When you can’t reach a confident verdict early, alerts turn into repeat checks, back-and-forth, and “just escalate it” calls. That cost doesn’t stay inside the SOC; it shows up as missed SLAs, higher cost per case, and more room for real threats to slip through.

So where does triage go wrong? Here are five triage issues that turn investigations into expensive guesswork, and how top teams are changing the outcome with execution evidence.

1. Decisions Made Without Real Evidence

Business risk: The hardest triage failure to notice is when decisions get made before proof exists. If responders rely on partial signals (labels, hash matches, reputation), they end up approving or escalating cases without seeing what the file or link actually does.

That uncertainty fuels false positives, missed real threats, slower containment, and higher cost per case, while giving attackers more time before anyone has confidence in the verdict.

The Fix: Get Execution Evidence Early

High-performing teams reduce this risk by validating behavior at triage, not later. Sandboxes make that practical by showing real execution: process activity, network calls, persistence, and the full attack chain.

For example, with ANY.RUN’s interactive sandbox, teams report that in ~90% of cases, they can see the full attack chain within ~60 seconds, turning unclear alerts into evidence-backed decisions early in the workflow.

See the complex hybrid attack exposed in 35 seconds.

In this real-world hybrid phishing scenario combining Tycoon 2FA and Salty 2FA, most traditional controls failed to detect the threat because the attack blended multiple kits and evasive redirects. Inside an interactive sandbox, however, the full malicious flow and a clear verdict appeared in just 35 seconds.

Improve triage speed and certainty to cut MTTR by up to 21 minutes per case, control escalation costs, and limit real business exposure.

Explore faster triage

Faster, evidence-backed verdicts at triage

Lower cost per case by reducing rework

Fewer missed threats caused by “unclear” closures

2. Triage Quality Depends on Analyst Seniority

Business risk: In many SOCs, the outcome of triage depends on who touches the alert. Senior staff close faster because they recognize patterns; junior staff escalates because they don’t have enough confidence or context. The result is inconsistent verdicts, uneven response speed, and a workflow that doesn’t scale cleanly as alert volume grows.

The Fix: Make Triage Repeatable for Every Shift

Top teams reduce this gap by designing triage around shared evidence and repeatable steps, not personal experience. The goal is simple: give Tier 1 enough clarity to reach the same conclusion a senior responder would, using the same observable facts.

With ANY.RUN, teams can share the same sandbox session and findings through built-in teamwork features, so knowledge doesn’t stay in one person’s head. That consistency helps reduce “escalate to be safe” behavior and keeps triage outcomes stable across shifts.

Consistent triage across shifts

More predictable SLAs

3. Triage Delays Give Attackers More Time

Business risk: Even when a threat is detected, triage can take too long to confirm what’s happening. Manual checks and queued escalations delay action, extending dwell time and giving attackers room to move laterally or exfiltrate data. The business impact shows up as missed SLAs and higher incident costs.

The Fix: Shrink Time-to-Decision at Triage

High-performing teams treat triage as a speed problem: reduce the steps between detection and a defensible verdict. That means confirming behavior immediately, before the case bounces between queues or turns into a long validation loop.

With the interactive sandbox, suspicious files and URLs can be detonated quickly, and the full attack chain often becomes visible in under a minute. Operational results often show up to 21 minutes shaved off MTTR per case, because teams spend less time waiting, re-checking, and escalating just to confirm what’s happening.

Earlier confirmation, shorter dwell time

Fewer SLA misses under load

Smaller incident impact

4. Over-Escalation Hides Real Priority Incidents

Business risk: When evidence is unclear, Tier 1 escalates “just to be safe,” and Tier 2 becomes a verification layer for borderline cases. That clogs queues, pulls senior time into “maybes,” and slows response to high-impact incidents, increasing cost per investigation and raising the risk that critical cases wait too long.

The Fix: Close More Cases at Tier 1 with Execution Evidence

When Tier 1 can prove or dismiss alerts independently, Tier 2 stays focused on real incidents instead of acting as a verification desk.

With solutions like ANY.RUN, that becomes realistic because the sandbox is built for fast triage: it’s intuitive to use, provides AI-assisted guidance during analysis, and generates auto-built reports that capture the key evidence without extra manual write-ups. A dedicated IOCs tab also pulls indicators into one place, so Tier 1 can escalate with context rather than escalating for confirmation.

This is how teams see up to a 30% reduction in Tier-1 → Tier-2 escalations, preserving senior capacity for high-risk threats.

Lower escalation volume

5. Manual Work Limits Scale and Increases Error

Business risk: A lot of triage is still repetitive manual work, following redirect chains, dealing with CAPTCHAs, or uncovering hidden links in QR codes. As volume grows, this limits throughput, increases mistakes, and triggers unnecessary escalation simply because teams run out of time.

The Fix: Reduce Manual Steps with Interactive Automation

Modern sandbox environments combine automation with human-like interactivity, allowing suspicious content to be safely opened, redirected flows followed, and protection mechanisms such as CAPTCHAs or QR-embedded links to be handled automatically during analysis.

With ANY.RUN’s interactive sandbox, these routine triage actions are performed inside the controlled environment, exposing hidden malicious behavior while removing repetitive work from responders. In day-to-day operations, teams often see up to a 20% decrease in Tier 1 workload, along with fewer escalations and more time available for high-value investigation.

More time for confirmed threats

Reduce Business Risk by Fixing Triage First

Broken triage rarely looks dramatic. Instead, it quietly slows response, increases escalation pressure, and keeps real threats open longer than the business can afford.

Teams that shift to evidence-driven, execution-based triage consistently report measurable gains, including:

Up to 3× improvement in overall SOC efficiency

94% of users reported faster triage and clearer verdicts

Up to 58% more threats identified across investigations

Improving speed, certainty, and scalability at the triage stage is one of the fastest ways to reduce MTTR, control operational cost, and cut real business exposure.

Explore evidence-driven triage for your SOC and turn faster decisions into measurable security performance.

[9] The Hacker News - Malicious NuGet Packages Stole ASP.NET Data; npm Package Dropped Malware
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Wed, 25 Feb 2026 18:13:00 +0530

[TAM METİN - 769 kelime]
Cybersecurity researchers have discovered four malicious NuGet packages that are designed to target ASP.NET web application developers to steal sensitive data.

The campaign, discovered by Socket, exfiltrates ASP.NET Identity data, including user accounts, role assignments, and permission mappings, as well as manipulates authorization rules to create persistent backdoors in victim applications.

The names of the packages are listed below -

The NuGet packages were published to the repository between August 12 and 21, 2024, by a user named hamzazaheer. They have since been taken down from the repository following responsible disclosure, but not before attracting more than 4,500 downloads.

According to the software supply chain security company, NCryptYo acts as a first-stage dropper that establishes a local proxy on localhost:7152 that relays traffic to an attacker-controlled command-and-control (C2) server whose address is dynamically retrieved at runtime. It's worth noting that NCryptYo attempts to masquerade as the legitimate NCrypto package.

DOMOAuth2_ and IRAOAuth2.0 steal Identity data and backdoor apps, while SimpleWriter_ features unconditional file writing and hidden process execution capabilities while presenting itself as a PDF conversion utility. An analysis of package metadata has revealed identical build environments, indicating that the campaign is the work of a single threat actor.

"NCryptYo is a stage-1 execution-on-load dropper," security researcher Kush Pandya said. "When the assembly loads, its static constructor installs JIT compiler hooks that decrypt embedded payloads and deploy a stage-2 binary - a localhost proxy on port 7152 that relays traffic between the companion packages and the attacker's external C2 server, whose address is resolved dynamically at runtime."

Once the proxy is active, DOMOAuth2_ and IRAOAuth2.0 begin transmitting the ASP.NET Identity data through the local proxy to the external infrastructure. The C2 server responds with authorization rules that are then processed by the application to create a persistent backdoor by granting themselves admin roles, modifying access controls, or disabling security checks. SimpleWriter_, for its part, writes threat actor-controlled content to disk and executes the dropped binary with hidden windows.

It's not exactly clear how users are tricked into downloading these packages, as the attack chain kicks in only after all four of them are installed.

"The campaign's objective is not to compromise the developer's machine directly, but to compromise the applications they build," Pandya explained. "By controlling the authorization layer during development, the threat actor gains access to deployed production applications."

"When the victim deploys their ASP.NET application with the malicious dependencies, the C2 infrastructure remains active in production, continuously exfiltrating permission data and accepting modified authorization rules. The threat actor or a buyer can then grant themselves admin-level access to any deployed instance."

The disclosure comes as Tenable disclosed details of a malicious npm package named ambar-src that amassed more than 50,000 downloads before it was removed from the JavaScript registry. It was uploaded to npm on February 13, 2026.

The package makes use of npm's preinstall script hook to trigger the execution of malicious code contained within index.js during its installation. The malware is designed to run a one-liner command that obtains different payloads from the domain "x-ya[.]ru" based on the operating system -

On Windows, it downloads and executes a file called msinit.exe containing encrypted shellcode, which is decoded and loaded into memory.

On Linux, it fetches a bash script and executes it. The bash script then retrieves another payload from the same server, an ELF binary that works as an SSH-based reverse shell client.

On macOS, it fetches another script that uses osascript to run JavaScript responsible for dropping Apfell, a JavaScript for Automation (JXA) agent part of the Mythic C2 framework that can conduct reconnaissance, collect screenshots, steal data from Google Chrome, and capture system passwords by displaying a fake prompt.

"It employs multiple techniques to evade detection, and drops open-source malware with advanced capabilities, targeting developers on Windows, Linux, and macOS hosts," the company said.

Once the data is collected, it's exfiltrated to the attacker to a Yandex Cloud domain in an effort to blend in with legitimate traffic and take advantage of the fact that trusted services are less likely to be blocked within corporate networks.

Ambar-src is assessed to be a more mature variant of eslint-verify-plugin, another rogue npm package that was recently flagged by JFrog as dropping Mythic agents Poseidon and Apfell on Linux and macOS systems.

"If this package is installed or running on a computer, that system must be considered fully compromised," Tenable said. "While the package should be removed, please be aware that because an external entity may have gained full control of the computer, removing the package does not guarantee the elimination of all resulting malicious software."

[10] The Hacker News - Manual Processes Are Putting National Security at Risk
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Wed, 25 Feb 2026 16:30:00 +0530
Link: https://thehackernews.com/2026/02/manual-processes-are-putting-national.html

[TAM METİN - 1379 kelime]
Why automating sensitive data transfers is now a mission-critical priority

More than half of national security organizations still rely on manual processes to transfer sensitive data, according to The CYBER360: Defending the Digital Battlespace report. This should alarm every defense and government leader because manual handling of sensitive data is not just inefficient, it is a systemic vulnerability.

Recent breaches in defense supply chains show how manual processes create exploitable gaps that adversaries can weaponize. This is not just a technical issue. It is a strategic challenge for every organization operating in contested domains, where speed and certainty define mission success.

In an era defined by accelerating cyber threats and geopolitical tension, every second counts. Delays, errors, and gaps in control can cascade into consequences that compromise mission readiness, decision-making, and operational integrity. This is exactly what manual processes introduce: uncertainty in environments where certainty is non-negotiable. They create bottlenecks and increase the risk of human error. In short, they undermine the very principles of mission assurance: speed, accuracy, and trust.

Adversaries know this. They exploit seams in data movement. Every manual step is a potential breach point. In a contested environment, these vulnerabilities are operational, not theoretical.

If manual processes are so risky, why do they remain? The answer lies in a mix of technical, cultural, and organizational factors.

Legacy systems remain a major barrier. Many defense and government environments still run on infrastructure that predates modern automation capabilities. These systems were never designed for seamless integration with policy engines or encryption frameworks. Replacing them is costly and disruptive, so organizations layer manual steps as a workaround.

Procurement cycles compound the problem. Acquiring new technology in national security contexts is often slow and complex. Approval chains are long, requirements are rigid, and by the time a solution is deployed, the threat landscape has shifted. Leaders often adopt manual processes as a stopgap, but these temporary measures quickly become permanent habits.

Cross-domain complexity adds another layer. Moving data between classification levels requires strict controls. Historically, these controls relied on human judgment to inspect and approve transfers. Automation was seen as too rigid for nuanced decisions. That perception persists even as modern solutions can enforce granular policies without sacrificing flexibility.

Culture plays a role as well. Trust in people runs deep in national security organizations. Manual handling feels tangible and controllable. Leaders and operators believe that human oversight reduces risk, even when evidence shows the opposite. This slows the adoption of automation.

In some cases, operators still print and hand-carry classified files because digital workflows are perceived as too risky. Regulatory inaction compounds this problem. Compliance frameworks often lag behind technology, reinforcing manual habits and slowing modernization efforts.

Finally, there is a fear of disruption. Missions cannot pause for technology transitions. Leaders worry the automation will introduce delays or errors during rollout. They prefer the known imperfections of manual processes to the unknown risks of change.

These factors explain persistence, but they do not justify it. The environment has changed. Threats are faster, more sophisticated, and increasingly opportunistic.

The Risk of Manual Handling

Human error and variability: Sensitive data transfer should be consistent and precise. Manual steps introduce variance across teams and time. Even highly trained personnel face fatigue and workload pressure. Small errors can cascade into operational delays or unintended disclosures. Fatigue during high-tempo missions amplifies mistakes, and insider risk grows when oversight depends on trust alone.

Weak enforcement of policy: Automation turns policy into code. Manual handling turns policy into interpretation. Under pressure, exceptions grow, and workarounds become standard practice. Over time, compliance erodes. These gaps slow incident response and undermine accountability during investigations, leaving leaders without timely insights when decisions matter most.

Audit gaps and accountability risks: Manual movements are hard to track. Evidence is fragmented across emails and ad hoc logs. Investigations take too long. Leaders cannot rely on consistent chain-of-custody records.

Security blind spots across domains: Sensitive data often moves across classification levels and networks. Manual processes make these transitions opaque. Adversaries exploit seams where enforcement is inconsistent.

Mission performance drag: Speed is a security control. Manual transfers add handoffs and delays. Decision cycles slow down. People compensate by skipping steps, introducing new risks.

Manual processes are not resilient. They are fragile, and they fail quietly and then fail loudly.

Principles for Secure Automation: The Cybersecurity Trinity

Manual processes are not resilient. They fail quietly and then fail loudly. Eliminating these vulnerabilities requires more than simply automating steps. It demands a security architecture that enforces trust, protects data, and manages boundaries at scale. So, how do defense and government organizations close these gaps and make automation secure? The answer lies in three principles that work together to protect identity, data, and domain boundaries. This is the Cybersecurity Trinity

Automation alone is no longer enough. Modern missions demand a layered approach that addresses identity, data, and domain boundaries. The Cybersecurity Trinity of Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA), Data-Centric Security (DCS), and Cross Domain Solutions (CDS) is now a mission imperative for defense and government organizations.

Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) ensures that every user, device, and transaction is verified continuously. It eliminates implicit trust and enforces least privilege across all environments. ZTA is the foundation for identity assurance and access control. This reduces insider risk and ensures coalition partners operate under consistent trust models, even in dynamic mission environments.

Data-Centric Security (DCS) shifts the focus from perimeter defense to protecting the data itself. It applies encryption, classification, and policy enforcement wherever the data resides or moves. In sensitive workflows, DCS ensures that even if networks are compromised, the data remains secure. It supports interoperability by applying uniform controls across diverse networks, enabling secure collaboration without slowing operations.

Cross Domain Solutions (CDS) enable controlled, secure transfer of information between classification levels and operational domains. They enforce release authorities, sanitize content, and prevent unauthorized disclosure. CDS is critical for coalition operations, intelligence sharing, and mission agility. These solutions enable secure multinational sharing without introducing delays, which is critical for time-sensitive intelligence exchange.

Together, these three principles form the backbone of secure automation. They close the gaps that manual processes leave open. They make security measurable and mission success sustainable.

Special Considerations for Defense and Government

Sensitive data transfer in national security contexts presents unique challenges. CDS requires automated inspection and enforcement of release authorities. Coalition operations demand federated identity and shared standards to maintain security across organizational boundaries. Tactical systems need lightweight agents and resilient synchronization for low-bandwidth environments. Supply chain exposure must be addressed by extending automation to contractors with strong verification and audit requirements.

In joint missions, delays caused by manual checks can stall intelligence sharing and compromise operational tempo. Automation mitigates these risks by enforcing common standards across partners. Emerging threats such as AI-driven attacks and deepfake data manipulation make manual verification obsolete, increasing the urgency for automated safeguards. Insider risk remains a concern, but automation reduces opportunities for misuse by limiting manual handling and providing detailed audit trails.

Automation does not eliminate the need for skilled personnel. It changes their focus. People design policies, manage exceptions, and investigate alerts. To make the transition successful, invest in training and culture. Show teams how automation improves mission speed and reduces rework. Communicate clearly and consistently. Celebrate early wins. Create feedback loops where operators can refine workflows. Start with pilot programs in low-risk workflows to build confidence before scaling. Leadership buy-in and clear communication are essential to overcome resistance and accelerate adoption. When automation feels like support rather than surveillance, adoption accelerates.

Manual handling of sensitive data is a strategic liability. It slows missions, creates blind spots, and erodes trust. Automation is not optional; it is mission imperative. Start with high-impact workflows designed by subject matter experts, and in turn, appropriately test the policy into enforceable rules. Integrate identity, encryption, and audit. Measure outcomes, train teams, and fund initiatives that reduce risk.

What should not remain true is that more than half rely on manual today. Your organization does not have to be among them tomorrow. The next conflict will not wait for manual processes to catch up. Leaders must act now to harden data flows, accelerate mission readiness, and ensure that automation becomes a force multiplier rather than a future aspiration.

[11] BleepingComputer - Ransomware payment rate drops to record low as attacks surge
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Thu, 26 Feb 2026 09:00:59 -0500
Link: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-payment-rate-drops-to-record-low-despite-attack-surge/

[TAM METİN - 603 kelime]
The number of ransomware victims paying threat actors has dropped to 28% last year, an all-time low, despite a significant increase in the number of claimed attacks.

A downward payment trend has been observed for the past four consecutive years by the blockchain intelligence platform Chainalysis.

At the moment, the total of on-chain ransomware payments in 2025 stands at $820 million, but the company notes that "the 2025 total is likely to approach or exceed $900 million as we attribute more events and payments."

Chainalysis reports a relative stability in the total number of payments, despite a 50% increase of ransomware attacks year-over-year.

In 2024, the payment rate recorded by Chainalysis was more than double, at 62.8%, while in 2022, it was at 78.9%.

Data from Chainalysis also aligns with previous reports by Coveware, which showed a steady decline in victim payment rates throughout 2025.

According to the blockchain company, some of the factors that influenced the ransomware economy include improved incident response, regulatory scrutiny, international law enforcement actions, and market fragmentation.

Current Chainalysis data shows that while aggregate revenue from ransomware activity declined, the median ransom payment rose significantly, up 368% from $12,738 in 2024 to $59,556 in 2025.

This indicates that ransomware victims pay larger amounts for the hope that cybercriminals will delete the stolen data and not sell it to other threat actors or trade it.

In 2025, the analysts observed 85 active extortion groups, far higher compared to previous years, when the ransomware space was dominated by a small number of threat groups and RaaS platforms.

A few high-impact incidents Chainalysis highlights in its report include the attack at Jaguar Land Rover, which inflicted an estimated $2.5 billion in damages, the Marks & Spencer breach by the Scattered Spider threat group, and the DaVita Inc. ransomware breach that exposed 2.7 million patient records.

For another year, the most targeted country was the United States, followed by Canada, Germany, and the U.K., showing threat actors’ preference for concentrating their efforts in developed economies.

Initial access brokers (IABs), hackers who sell access to compromised endpoints to ransomware operators, reportedly made $14 million in 2025, roughly the same as last year. This is only 1.7% of the total ransomware revenue last year, though initial access is a key enabler.

Analysis shows that spikes in IAB payment inflows are followed by increases in ransomware payments and victim leak posts roughly 30 days later, suggesting IAB activity can act as a leading indicator.

The average price for network access declined from approximately $1,427 in Q1 2023 to just $439 in Q1 2026, indicating that automation, AI-assisted tooling, and oversupply from info-stealer logs have shaped the industry.

Chainalysis says that although ransom payments declined last year, the scale, sophistication, and real-world impact of ransomware attacks continued to grow, impacting organizations of all sizes and backgrounds globally.

The researchers believe ransomware is going through a phase of adaptation, rather than losing the fight, evolving tactics to extract more value from an ever-decreasing number of consenting victims.

[12] BleepingComputer - Microsoft expands Windows restore to more enterprise devices
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Thu, 26 Feb 2026 08:04:02 -0500

Microsoft now allows more enterprise users to restore their personal settings and Microsoft Store apps from a previous Windows 11 device.

The feature, known as the first sign-in restore experience, is part of Windows Backup for Organizations, an enterprise-grade backup tool that helps simplify backups and migrate to Windows 11 more easily.

It allows users who sign in to a new or reimaged Windows 11 device with a Microsoft Entra ID account to restore their previous settings and Microsoft Store app list on first login, even if they missed the option during the device's initial setup.

This restore functionality was previously limited to devices joined to Microsoft Entra, the company's cloud-based identity platform. With this update, Microsoft extends support to hybrid-managed environments, multi-user device setups, and Windows 365 Cloud PCs, broadening its reach across a wider range of enterprise deployment scenarios.

"This allows users to restore Windows settings, restore their Microsoft Store app list, or choose to configure the device as new," Microsoft said on Tuesday.

"This feature extends restore capabilities beyond Microsoft Entra-joined devices to support hybrid-managed environments, improving readiness for new or reimaged Windows 11 devices."

When a user logs into an eligible device for the first time, a prompt will appear offering the option to restore from a previous device's backup or set up the device as new. Users who deliberately skip the restore step during initial device setup will not be prompted again.

​The Windows first sign-in restore feature is managed through existing Windows Backup for Organizations policies and can be configured using Microsoft Intune or Group Policy, allowing IT administrators to deploy it without learning new tools.

Microsoft noted that the feature is particularly useful for organizations migrating to Windows 11 or those that go through frequent hardware refreshes, and added that admins will retain full control over which devices and users the restore experience applies to.

"General availability begins with devices that have installed Windows updates released February 24, 2026, and later. The experience is controlled by admins and governed by existing Windows Backup for Organizations policies," Microsoft said.

Windows Backup for Organizations was first announced at the Microsoft Ignite conference in November 2024 as an opt-in feature disabled by default, reaching public preview in May 2025 and general availability in August.

[13] BleepingComputer - New York sues Valve for promoting illegal gambling via game loot boxes
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[TAM METİN - 521 kelime]
New York Attorney General Letitia James sued video game developer and publisher Valve Corporation for using game loot boxes to facilitate illegal gambling activities among children and teenagers.

Valve operates Steam, one of the largest digital game distribution services in the world, offering access to thousands of games for millions of users worldwide. At the time this article was published, Steam was reporting over 29 million players online, with nearly 7.5 million playing a game.

Attorney General James said the gaming giant is violating the state's gambling laws by offering players the opportunity to win random virtual prizes that can be exchanged for real money, in a process described as being similar to a slot machine.

"Illegal gambling can be harmful and lead to serious addiction problems, especially for our young people," said James. "Valve has made billions of dollars by letting children and adults alike illegally gamble for the chance to win valuable virtual prizes. These features are addictive, harmful, and illegal, and my office is suing to stop Valve's illegal conduct and protect New Yorkers."

The lawsuit targets loot boxes in Counter-Strike 2, Team Fortress 2, and Dota 2 that award players with random items, such as weapon skins or character accessories. However, the odds of winning rare items are allegedly deliberately skewed by Valve to make them far more valuable, leading the total value of market items to balloon to an estimated $4.3 billion as of March 2025, according to Attorney General James.

Some individual items (such as AK-47 skins) have even fetched prices of over $1 million, making Steam accounts a frequent target for hackers and scammers.

The lawsuit also highlights the potential harm to children, as they may be drawn into loot box purchases to win rare items and boost social status within gaming communities. "Children who are introduced to gambling are four times more likely to develop a gambling problem later in life than those who are not," according to research cited in the Wednesday press release.

Attorney General James has asked the court to permanently bar Valve from operating loot box features in the state, to require the company to return all profits generated by the practice, and to impose fines for the alleged violations.

In January 2025, Genshin Impact developer Cognosphere (aka Hoyoverse) agreed to pay $20 million to settle a U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) lawsuit over unfair marketing of loot boxes to minors, obscuring the actual costs. andmisleading the players about the odds of winning prizes.

BleepingComputer reached out to a Valve spokesperson for comment, but a response was not immediately available.

[TAM METİN - 458 kelime]
American manufacturer of medical devices, UFP Technologies, has disclosed that a cybersecurity incident has compromised its IT systems and data.

UFP Technologies is a publicly traded medical engineering and manufacturing company that produces a broad range of devices and components used in surgery, wound care, implants, orthopedic applications, and healthcare wearables.

The company employs 4,300 people, has an annual revenue of $600 million, and a market cap of $1.86 billion, according to recent data.

In a filing submitted yesterday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), UFP Technologies disclosed that it detected suspicious activity on its IT systems on February 14.

The firm immediately deployed isolation and remediation measures and engaged external cybersecurity advisors to help with the investigation.

Preliminary results of the investigation indicate that the threat has been removed, but the hacker was able to steal data from compromised systems.

“Through the Company’s efforts, the Company believes that the third party responsible for this cybersecurity incident has been removed from the Company’s IT systems, and the Company’s ability to access information impacted by this incident has been restored in all material respects,” reads the SEC filing.

“The incident appears to have impacted many but not all of the Company’s IT systems and affected functions such as billing and label making for customer deliveries. Certain Company or Company-related data appear to have been stolen or destroyed.”

The data destruction note suggests a ransomware or wiper attack, although the nature of the malware remains unclear.

BleepingComputer has contacted UFP Technologies to ask about the attack and whether it involved data encryption/ransom payment demands, but a comment wasn’t immediately available.

At the time of publishing, no ransomware group has publicly claimed the attack on UFP Technologies.

UFP Technologies mentioned that, at this time, it has not determined whether personal information has been exfiltrated. If confirmed at a later time, notifications will be sent to impacted individuals as required by law.

The company stated that, despite the cybersecurity incident, its primary IT systems remain operational. Based on current evidence and assessments, UFP Technologies states it is unlikely that the incident will have a material impact on its operations or financials.

[15] BleepingComputer - Fake Next.js job interview tests backdoor developer's devices
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Wed, 25 Feb 2026 16:47:12 -0500
Link: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fake-nextjs-job-interview-tests-backdoor-developers-devices/

[TAM METİN - 579 kelime]
A coordinated campaign targeting software developers with job-themed lures is using malicious repositories posing as legitimate Next.js projects and technical assessment materials, including recruiting coding tests.

The attacker's goal is to achieve remote code execution (RCE) on developer machines, exfiltrate sensitive data, and introduce additional payloads on compromised systems.

Next.js is a popular JavaScript framework used for building web applications. It runs on top of React and uses Node.js for the backend.

The Microsoft Defender team says that the attacker created fake web app projects built with Next.js and disguised them as coding projects to share with developers during job interviews or technical assessments.

The researchers initially identified a repository hosted on the Bitbucket cloud-based Git-based code hosting and collaboration service. However, they discovered multiple repositories that shared code structure, loader logic, and naming patterns.

When the target clones the repository and opens it locally, following a standard workflow, they trigger malicious JavaScript that executes automatically when launching the app.

The script downloads additional malicious code (a JavaScript backdoor) from the attacker's server and executes it directly in memory with the running Node.js process, allowing remote code execution on the machine.

To increase the infection rate, the attackers embedded multiple execution triggers within the malicious repositories, Microsoft explained. These are summarized as follows:

VS Code trigger – A .vscode/tasks.json file set with runOn: "folderOpen" executes a Node script as soon as the project folder is opened (and trusted).

Dev server trigger – When the developer runs npm run dev, a trojanized asset (e.g., a modified JS library) decodes a hidden URL, fetches a loader from a remote server, and executes it in memory.

Backend startup trigger – On server start, a backend module decodes a base64 endpoint from .env, sends process.env to the attacker, receives JavaScript in response, and executes it using new Function().

The infection process drops a JavaScript payload (Stage 1) that profiles the host and registers with a command-and-control (C2) endpoint, polling the server at fixed intervals.

The infection then upgrades to a tasking controller (Stage 2) that connects to a separate C2 server, checks for tasks, executes supplied JavaScript in memory, and tracks spawned processes. The payload also supports file enumeration, directory browsing, and staged file exfiltration.

Microsoft found that the campaign involved multiple repositories that shared naming conventions, loader structure, and staging infrastructure, indicating a coordinated effort rather than a one-off attack.

Aside from the technical analysis, the researchers did not provide any details about the attacker or the extent of the operation.

The tech giant advises that developers should treat standard workflows as the high-risk attack surfaces they really are and take appropriate precautions.

The recommended mitigations include enforcing VS Code Workspace Trust/Restricted Mode, using Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) rules, and monitoring risky sign-ins with Entra ID Protection.

Secrets stored on developer endpoints should be minimized, and short-lived tokens with the least required privileges should be used where possible.

[16] BleepingComputer - Critical Cisco SD-WAN bug exploited in zero-day attacks since 2023
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Wed, 25 Feb 2026 13:01:51 -0500
Link: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/critical-cisco-sd-wan-bug-exploited-in-zero-day-attacks-since-2023/

[TAM METİN - 985 kelime]
Cisco is warning that a critical authentication bypass vulnerability in Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN, tracked as CVE-2026-20127, was actively exploited in zero-day attacks that allowed remote attackers to compromise controllers and add malicious rogue peers to targeted networks.

CVE-2026-20127 has a maximum severity of 10.0 and impacts Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Controller (formerly vSmart) and Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Manager (formerly vManage) in on-prem and SD-WAN Cloud installations.

Cisco credited the Australian Signals Directorate's Australian Cyber Security Centre (ASD's ACSC) for reporting the vulnerability.

In an advisory published today, Cisco said the issue stems from a peering authentication mechanism that "is not working properly."

"This vulnerability exists because the peering authentication mechanism in an affected system is not working properly. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted requests to an affected system," reads the Cisco CVE-2026-20127 advisory.

"A successful exploit could allow the attacker to log in to an affected Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Controller as an internal, high-privileged, non-root user account. Using this account, the attacker could access NETCONF, which would then allow the attacker to manipulate network configuration for the SD-WAN fabric."

Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN is a software-based networking platform that connects branch offices, data centers, and cloud environments through a centrally managed system. It uses a controller to securely route traffic between sites over encrypted connections.

By adding a rogue peer, an attacker can insert a malicious device into the SD-WAN environment that appears legitimate. That device could then establish encrypted connections and advertise networks under the attacker's control, potentially allowing them to move deeper into the organization's network.

A separate advisory from Cisco Talos says the flaw was actively exploited in attacks and is tracking the malicious activity under "UAT-8616," which it assesses with high confidence was conducted by a highly sophisticated threat actor.

Talos reports that its telemetry shows exploitation dates back to at least 2023, with intelligence partners stating the threat actor likely escalated to root by downgrading to an older software version, exploiting  CVE-2022-20775 to gain root access, and then restoring the original firmware version.

By reverting to the original version after exploitation, the attacker could obtain root access while evading detection.

The exploitation was disclosed in coordinated advisories between Cisco and the U.S. and UK authorities.

On February 25, 2026, CISA issued Emergency Directive 26-03 requiring Federal Civilian Executive Branch agencies to inventory Cisco SD-WAN systems, collect forensic artifacts, ensure external log storage, apply updates, and investigate potential compromises tied to CVE-2026-20127 and CVE-2022-20775.

CISA said the exploitation poses an imminent threat to federal networks and that devices must be patched by 5:00 PM ET on February 27, 2026.

A joint hunt and hardening guide from CISA and the UK's National Cyber Security Centre warned that malicious actors are targeting Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN deployments globally to add rogue peers, then conduct follow-on actions to achieve root access and maintain persistent control.

The advisories stress that SD-WAN management interfaces must never be exposed to the internet and urges organizations to immediately update and harden affected systems.

“Our new alert makes clear that organisations using Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN products should urgently investigate their exposure to network compromise and hunt for malicious activity, making use of the new threat hunting advice produced with our international partners to identify evidence of compromise," said Ollie Whitehouse, NCSC CTO, in a statement shared with BleepingComputer.

“UK organisations are strongly advised to report compromises to the NCSC, and to apply vendor updates and hardening guidance as soon as practicable to reduce the risk of exploitation.”

Cisco has released software updates to address the vulnerability and says there are no workarounds that fully mitigate the issue.

Indicators of compromise

Cisco and Talos are urging organizations to carefully review logs on any internet-exposed Catalyst SD-WAN Controller systems for signs of unauthorized peering events and suspicious authentication activity.

The company recommends admins audit /var/log/auth.log for entries showing "Accepted publickey for vmanage-admin" from unknown IP addresses:

Administrators should compare those IP addresses against the configured System IPs listed in the SD-WAN Manager interface and against known management or controller infrastructure. If an unknown IP address successfully authenticated, administrators should consider their devices to be compromised and open a Cisco TAC case.

Talos and government advisories shared additional indicators of compromise, including the creation and deletion of malicious user accounts, unexpected root logins, unauthorized SSH keys in the vmanage-admin or root accounts, and changes that enable PermitRootLogin.

Admins should also look for unusually small or missing log files, which may indicate log tampering, and for software downgrades and reboots, which may indicate exploitation of CVE-2022-20775 to gain root privileges.

To check for exploitation of CVE-2022-20775, CISA recommends analyzing the following logs:

CISA's hunt and hardening guide instructs organizations to collect forensic artifacts, including admin core dumps and user home directories, and to ensure logs are stored externally to prevent tampering.

If a root account was compromised, agencies should deploy fresh installs rather than attempting to clean the existing infrastructure.

Organizations should also treat unexpected peering events or unexplained controller activity as potential indicators of compromise and investigate them immediately.

Both CISA and the UK NCSC recommend restricting network exposure, placing SD-WAN control components behind firewalls, isolating management interfaces, forwarding logs to external systems, and applying Cisco's hardening guidance.

Cisco strongly recommends upgrading to a fixed software release as the only way to remediate CVE-2026-20127 completely.

[17] BleepingComputer - Chinese cyberspies breached dozens of telecom firms, govt agencies
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[TAM METİN - 536 kelime]
Google’s Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG), Mandiant, and partners disrupted a global espionage campaign attributed to a suspected Chinese threat actor that used SaaS API calls to hide malicious traffic in attacks targeting telecom and government networks.

The campaign has been active since at least 2023 and has impacted 53 organizations in 42 countries, with suspected infections in at least 20 more countries.

The initial access vector is unknown, but the researchers note that the threat actor, which Google tracks internally as UNC2814, has previously gained access by exploiting flaws in web servers and edge systems.

Google says that in the recently disrupted campaign, the actor deployed a new C-based backdoor named ‘GRIDTIDE,’ which abuses the Google Sheets API for evasive command-and-control (C2) operations.

GRIDTIDE authenticates to a Google Service Account using a hardcoded private key, and upon launch, it sanitizes the spreadsheet by deleting rows 1-1000 and columns from A to Z.

It then performs host reconnaissance, collecting the username, hostname, OS details, local IP, locale, and timezone, and logging the data in cell V1.

The first cell in the spreadsheet, A1, is the command/status cell, which GRIDTIDE polls constantly to receive instructions.

If any exist, the malware overwrites them with a status string. If empty, the malware retries every second for 120 times, then switches to random 5-10-minute checks to reduce noise.

The commands supported by GRIDTIDE are:

C – execute Base64-encoded bash commands, write output to the sheet

U – upload: take data in A2:A<arg_2> and reconstruct/write file at encoded filepath <arg_1>

D – download: read local file <arg_1> on endpoint, send contents in ~45 KB fragments into A2:An

The A2-An cells are used for writing the command output, exfiltrated files, and uploading tools.

Google reports that GRIDTIDE’s exchanges with the C2 rely on a URL-safe base64 encoding scheme that evades detection by web monitoring tools and blends with normal traffic.

In at least one case, Google confirmed that GRIDTIDE was deployed on a system that contained sensitive personally identifiable information (PII). However, the researchers did not directly observe data exfiltration.

Google, Mandiant, and partners took coordinated action to disrupt the campaign by terminating all Google Cloud projects controlled by UNC2814, disabling known infrastructure, revoking Google Sheets API access, and disabling all cloud projects used in C2 operations. Current and historical domains were sinkholed.

Organizations impacted by GRIDTIDE were notified directly, and support was offered to clean the infections.

Google has listed detection rules at the bottom of the report, as well as indicators of compromise (IoCs).

Even though the disruption to the campaign was comprehensive, Google expects UNC2814 to resume activity using new infrastructure in the near future.

[18] BleepingComputer - Marquis sues SonicWall over backup breach that led to ransomware attack

[TAM METİN - 484 kelime]
Marquis Software Solutions has filed a lawsuit against SonicWall, accusing the cybersecurity company of gross negligence and misrepresentation that allegedly led to a ransomware attack disrupting operations at 74 U.S. banks.

On August 14, 2025, hackers breached Marqui's network in a ransomware attack after compromising a SonicWall firewall. The attacker stole files containing personal information received from business partners.

The details included names, addresses, phone numbers, Social Security numbers, Taxpayer Identification Numbers, and financial account information.

Marquis provides data analytics, CRM tools, compliance reporting, and digital marketing services, with a clientele that includes more than 700 banks, credit unions, and mortgage lenders.

In January 2026, Marquis officially accused SonicWall of security failures after determining that the hackers had not exploited an unpatched flaw in its firewall, as previously assumed. Instead, it was discovered that the attacker leveraged configuration data extracted from the vendor’s cloud backup infrastructure.

The cause of the breach was a security gap that SonicWall introduced in its MySonicWall cloud backup service via an API code change in February 2025.

The vulnerability allowed unauthorized access to firewall configuration backup files stored in SonicWall’s cloud, which contain AES-256 encrypted credentials, configuration data, and MFA scratch codes.

The cybersecurity vendor disclosed the incident only three weeks later and initially estimated it impacted 5% of its customer base, but later confirmed that all clients were impacted.

An investigation from incident response company Mandiant revealed that the attack was carried out by state-sponsored hackers.

Marquis states that at the time of the attack, its SonicWall firewall was up to date, multi-factor authentication (MFA) was enabled, and additional security controls were in place, but the threat actor compromised it using information exposed in the SonicWall cloud backup breach.

When contacted directly by Marquis about the MFA bypass, SonicWall allegedly withheld critical information and ignored the request.

"As a result of SonicWall’s conduct, Marquis has suffered, and continues to suffer, damages; a loss of customers; harm to its business reputation; lost business opportunities, revenue and profit; and substantial diminution in its enterprise value," Marquis notes in the complaint.

Marquis notes that it is now defending more than 36 consumer class action lawsuits stemming from the ransomware attack it suffered.

For this, Marquis now seeks monetary damages, indemnification, contribution for any judgments in the related class actions, attorneys’ fees, and equitable relief.

[19] BleepingComputer - The OpenClaw Hype: Analysis of Chatter from Open-Source Deep and Dark Web
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[TAM METİN - 1294 kelime]
OpenClaw started as a side project of a developer who wanted to make his (and others) life easier with AI assistance. Clean mailbox, control schedule, organize thoughts and hear some music while his bot is doing all the dirty jobs for him.

With vibe coding Peter Steinberger developed OpenClaw. Kudus for that. But since then apart from changing its name twice it created a massive chatter around two topics. The AI hype and its cyber security implications.

This project has rapidly moved from a niche automation framework discussed in developer communities to a topic appearing across security research feeds, Telegram channels, forums, and underground-adjacent chatter. Alongside it, names like ClawDBot and MoltBot have appeared in the same narrative space, often framed as malicious derivatives, companion tooling, or botnet-like ecosystems.

However, when Flare looked at aggregated telemetry across open sources, social platforms, and fringe underground discussions, a more nuanced story emerges.

The data suggests a real supply-chain security risk, but one that has not yet been fully weaponized into a mass-exploitation ecosystem. Instead, the conversation appears largely driven by security research amplification, platform hype cycles, and early-stage experimentation.

What OpenClaw Is: AI Automation Framework With Plugin Marketplace

OpenClaw is an AI-powered automation framework that allows users to manage emails, schedules, and system tasks through modular "skills"—user-installable plugins that execute commands on behalf of users.

The platform architecture includes:

Local or remote agent nodes that run automation tasks

A skills marketplace (ClawHub) where users download plugins

API integrations for external services (SSH, cloud platforms, productivity tools)

Centralized orchestration through gateway components

Conceptually, OpenClaw behaves less like a single application and more like a lightweight automation operating environment. That architectural model is powerful and also creates a large attack surface.

The moment execution logic becomes modular and user-installable, the platform inherits the same risks historically seen in:

Browser extension ecosystems

Package managers (npm, PyPI, RubyGems)

CI/CD automation marketplaces

OpenClaw's skills ecosystem is where most of the real security discussion currently lives.

This project has rapidly moved from a niche automation framework discussed in developer communities to a topic appearing across security research feeds, Telegram channels, forums, and underground-adjacent chatter.

Clawdbot (the original name) was released in November 2025, but the real hype began during January 2026, as reflected in Flare's threat monitoring platform:

Alongside it, names like ClawdBot and MoltBot have appeared in the same narrative space, often framed as malicious derivatives, companion tooling, or botnet-like ecosystems.

However, when examining aggregated telemetry across open sources, social platforms, and underground discussions, a more nuanced story emerges. The data suggests a real supply-chain security risk, but not yet a fully weaponized, mass-exploitation ecosystem. Instead, the conversation appears largely driven by security research amplification, platform hype cycles, and early-stage experimentation.

Track AI Platform Exploits in Underground Markets

Flare monitors Telegram channels and dark web forums where threat actors share malicious automation tools, poisoned plugins, and credential-stealing exploits.

Detect when your infrastructure appears in attacker discussions before damage occurs.

Critical Security Flaws Enable Remote Code Execution and Credential Theft

Security researchers identified multiple critical vulnerabilities that made OpenClaw an attractive target for supply chain attacks:

Confirmed Critical Vulnerabilities:

CVE-2026-25253 (One-click RCE): Malicious links can steal authentication tokens and trigger remote code execution without requiring skill installation—attackers can compromise systems through a single click.

Malicious Skill Supply Chain: Hundreds of poisoned skills uploaded to ClawHub delivering infostealers, remote access trojans (RATs), and backdoors disguised as legitimate automation tools.

No Skill Sandboxing: Skills execute with full agent and system permissions, allowing malware to access credentials, files, and network resources without restriction.

Prompt Injection Attacks: Malicious content can manipulate AI agents into executing attacker-controlled workflows through natural language commands, bypassing traditional software vulnerabilities.

Token and OAuth Abuse: Attackers leverage stolen or inherited authentication tokens to trigger legitimate API actions, making malicious activity appear authorized.

Common Deployment Misconfigurations:

Agents running with root or excessive system privileges

This supply chain poisoning approach mirrors tactics seen in traditional infostealer distribution campaigns, where attackers disguise malware as legitimate software to compromise user systems at scale.

The One Area That Is Real: Supply Chain Skill Abuse

The strongest confirmed risk pattern currently visible is:

Malicious skill distribution.

Malicious skill distribution.

Execution inside trusted automation context.

Execution inside trusted automation context.

Payload run - Credential / session / data exfiltration.

Payload run - Credential / session / data exfiltration.

This is enough to be dangerous, even without botnet-scale weaponization.

Automation frameworks collapse the distance between initial access and privileged execution. If a malicious skill lands inside a trusted agent, the attacker effectively inherits the permissions of the automation environment.

Why Security Researchers Are Driving the Conversation

The most likely explanation for the current OpenClaw hype cycle is timing. OpenClaw sits at the intersection of three major trends:

Agentic automation platforms

Agentic automation platforms

Plugin marketplace trust models

Plugin marketplace trust models

AI-assisted workflow execution

AI-assisted workflow execution

Security researchers tend to detect these risks early, before criminal ecosystems fully monetize them.

Conclusion: High Risk Potential, Early Exploitation Stage

The combined dataset suggests that OpenClaw is not currently showing signs of mass criminal operationalization at scale.

Instead, what we see is:

A real supply-chain risk surface (skills ecosystem)

The security community is talking about OpenClaw more than threat actors are currently exploiting it. Having said that, this is not a reason to ignore it. Historically, this phase often precedes real weaponization by weeks or months.

The lesson from OpenClaw is less about one framework and more about a broader shift.

Automation platforms with plugin ecosystems are becoming high-value targets long before organizations realize they have deployed them at scale.

[20] BleepingComputer - Zyxel warns of critical RCE flaw affecting over a dozen routers
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Wed, 25 Feb 2026 07:53:02 -0500

[TAM METİN - 472 kelime]
Taiwan networking provider Zyxel has released security updates to address a critical vulnerability affecting over a dozen router models that can allow unauthenticated attackers to gain remote command execution on unpatched devices.

Tracked as CVE-2025-13942, this command injection security flaw was found in the UPnP function of Zyxel 4G LTE/5G NR CPE, DSL/Ethernet CPE, Fiber ONTs, and wireless extenders.

Zyxel says that unauthenticated remote attackers can exploit it to execute operating system (OS) commands on an affected device using maliciously crafted UPnP SOAP requests.

However, CVE-2025-13942 attacks will likely be more limited than the severity rating suggests, as successful exploitation requires UPnP and WAN access to be enabled, with the latter disabled by default.

"It is important to note that WAN access is disabled by default on these devices, and the attack can be carried out remotely only if both WAN access and the vulnerable UPnP function have been enabled," Zyxel said. "Users are strongly advised to install the patches to maintain optimal protection."

On Tuesday, Zyxel also patched two high-severity post-authentication command-injection vulnerabilities (CVE-2025-13943 and CVE-2026-1459) that allow threat actors to execute OS commands using compromised credentials.

Internet security watchdog Shadowserver currently tracks nearly 120,000 Internet-exposed Zyxel devices, including over 76,000 routers.

​Zyxel devices are often targeted in attacks since they're provided by many internet service providers worldwide as the default out-of-the-box equipment when activating a new internet service contract.

The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is currently tracking 12 Zyxel vulnerabilitiesimpacting the company's routers, firewalls, and NAS devices that have been or are still actively exploited in the wild.

Earlier this month, Zyxel warned that it has no plans to patch a pair of zero-day security vulnerabilities (CVE-2024-40891 and CVE-2024-40891) that are actively exploited in attacks and affect end-of-life routers still available for sale online. Instead, the company "strongly" advised customers to replace their routers with newer products whose firmware has already been patched.

"VMG1312-B10A, VMG1312-B10B, VMG1312-B10E, VMG3312-B10A, VMG3313-B10A, VMG3926-B10B, VMG4325-B10A, VMG4380-B10A, VMG8324-B10A, VMG8924-B10A, SBG3300, and SBG3500, are legacy products that have reached end-of-life (EOL) for years," said Zyxel. "Therefore, we strongly recommend that users replace them with newer-generation products for optimal protection."

Zyxel claims that more than 1 million businesses use its networking products across 150 markets.

Hackers abused Cisco SD-WAN zero-day since 2023 to gain full admin control

Cisco SD-WAN vulnerability CVE-2026-20127 has been exploited since 2023 to gain unauthenticated admin access.

A critical Cisco SD-WAN vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2026-20127 (CVSS score of 10.0), has been actively exploited since 2023. The flaw affects Catalyst SD-WAN Controller and Manager and allows remote, unauthenticated attackers to bypass authentication and gain full administrative access by sending a crafted request to vulnerable systems.

“This vulnerability exists because the peering authentication mechanism in an affected system is not working properly. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted requests to an affected system.” reads the advisory. “A successful exploit could allow the attacker to log in to an affected Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Controller as an internal, high-privileged, non-root user account. Using this account, the attacker could access NETCONF, which would then allow the attacker to manipulate network configuration for the SD-WAN fabric.”

The vulnerability impacts all Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN deployments, regardless of configuration. Affected environments include:

Cisco Hosted SD-WAN Cloud

Cisco Hosted SD-WAN Cloud – Cisco Managed

Cisco Hosted SD-WAN Cloud – FedRAMP

Cisco credited the Australian Signals Directorate’s Australian Cyber Security Centre (ASD-ACSC) for reporting the issue and is tracking related exploitation under the name UAT-8616, describing the actor as highly sophisticated.

The flaw has been fixed in updated Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN releases, including: 20.9.8.2, 20.12.5.3, 20.12.6.1, 20.15.4.2, and 20.18.2.1. Customers running versions prior to 20.9.1 are advised to migrate to a patched release.

The shortcoming affects the following deployment types, irrespective of the device configuration –

Cisco Hosted SD-WAN Cloud

Cisco Hosted SD-WAN Cloud – Cisco Managed

Cisco Hosted SD-WAN Cloud – FedRAMP Environment

Cisco credited the Australian Signals Directorate’s Australian Cyber Security Centre (ASD-ACSC) for reporting the vulnerability. The networking equipment major is tracking the exploitation and subsequent post-compromise activity under the moniker UAT-8616, describing the cluster as a “highly sophisticated cyber threat actor.”

Cisco Talos tracks the exploitation as UAT-8616, a highly sophisticated threat actor active since at least 2023. Investigators found the group likely downgraded software to escalate privileges to root, exploited CVE-2022-20775, and then restored the original version to maintain stealthy root access. The campaign highlights the ongoing targeting of network edge devices to gain persistent access to high-value and critical infrastructure organizations. Customers are urged to apply the security updates immediately.

“Talos clusters this exploitation and subsequent post-compromise activity as “UAT-8616” whom we assess with high confidence is a highly sophisticated cyber threat actor. After the discovery of active exploitation of the 0-day in the wild, we were able to find evidence that the malicious activity went back at least three years (2023).” reads the report published by Cisco Talos. “Investigation conducted by intelligence partners identified that the actor likely escalated to root user via a software version downgrade. The actor then reportedly exploited CVE-2022-20775 before restoring back to the original software version, effectively allowing them to gain root access.”

Cisco warns that internet-exposed Catalyst SD-WAN Controllers are at risk. Customers should review /var/log/auth.log for suspicious “Accepted publickey for vmanage-admin” entries from unknown IPs and verify them against authorized System IPs in the web UI. All control peering events, especially vManage, must be manually validated for unusual timing, IPs, or device roles. If compromise is suspected, open a TAC case and collect admin-tech files. There are no full workarounds; restricting ports 22 and 830 may help temporarily, but upgrading to a fixed release is strongly recommended.

Cisco PSIRT has confirmed limited real-world exploitation of the vulnerability and strongly urges customers to upgrade to a patched software version to address the issue.

“We strongly recommend that you perform the steps outlined in this document. Cisco has also published a hardening guide for Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN deployments located at https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/Cisco-Catalyst-SD-WAN-HardeningGuide. It is strongly recommended that any customers who are utilizing the Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN technology follow the guidance provided in this hardening guide.” concludes Cisco Talos. “We also recommend referring to advisories here and here and the Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN threat hunting guide released by our intelligence partners for additional detection guidance.”

[22] Security Affairs - Google GTIG disrupted China-linked APT UNC2814 halting attacks on 53 orgs in 42 countries

Google GTIG disrupted China-linked APT UNC2814 halting attacks on 53 orgs in 42 countries

Google and partners disrupted UNC2814, a suspected China-linked group that hacked 53 organizations across 42 countries.

Google, with industry partners, disrupted the infrastructure of UNC2814, a suspected China-linked cyber espionage group that breached at least 53 organizations in 42 countries. The group has been active since at least 2017, and was spotted targeting governments and global telecoms across Africa, Asia, and the Americas, making it a highly prolific and elusive threat. UNC2814 is likely linked to additional infections in more than 20 other nations.

“Last week, Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG), Mandiant, and partners took action to disrupt a global espionage campaign targeting telecommunications and government organizations in dozens of nations across four continents.” reads the GTIG’s report. “The threat actor, UNC2814, is a suspected People’s Republic of China (PRC)-nexus cyber espionage group that GTIG has tracked since 2017. “

UNC2814 used API calls to SaaS apps as command-and-control (C2) infrastructure, disguising malicious traffic as legitimate activity. Rather than exploiting product flaws, the group leveraged legitimate Google Sheets API functions through a novel backdoor called GRIDTIDE.

The group’s operations target different victims than other campaigns, such as “Salt Typhoon,” using unique techniques and TTPs.

Mandiant, using Google SecOps, detected suspicious activity on a CentOS server where the binary /var/tmp/xapt launched a root shell and ran id to confirm root access, showing the attacker had escalated privileges. The researchers reported that the payload mimicked a legacy Debian tool to avoid detection.

Post-compromise, the actor moved laterally via SSH, used living-off-the-land binaries for reconnaissance, and installed the GRIDTIDE backdoor for persistence via a systemd service. Attackers executed GRIDTIDE with nohup ./xapt to keep it running after session closure, and deployed SoftEther VPN Bridge to create an encrypted outbound connection.

UNC2814 targeted endpoints containing personally identifiable information (names, phone numbers, dates of birth, and national IDs) consistent with telecom-focused cyber espionage. While no direct exfiltration was observed, UNC2814 could leverage such access to monitor communications, including call records and SMS messages, for surveillance and intelligence-gathering purposes.

GRIDTIDE is a sophisticated C-based backdoor used by UNC2814 that can execute shell commands, upload and download files. The malware uses Google Sheets as a command-and-control (C2) channel, hiding malicious traffic within legitimate API requests. While it currently uses Google Sheets, other cloud-based spreadsheet platforms could be exploited in a similar way.

The backdoor requires a 16-byte cryptographic key on the host to decrypt its Google Drive configuration, which contains service account credentials, spreadsheet IDs, and private keys.

“When executed, GRIDTIDE sanitizes its Google Sheet. It does this by deleting the first 1000 rows, across columns A to Z in the spreadsheet, by using the Google Sheets API batchClear method. This prevents previous commands or file data stored in the Sheet from interfering with the threat actor’s current session.” continues the report. “Once the Sheet is prepared, the backdoor conducts host-based reconnaissance. It fingerprints the endpoint by collecting the victim’s username, endpoint name, OS details, local IP address, and environmental data such as the current working directory, language settings, and local time zone.”

Commands from the attacker follow a structured syntax, allowing execution of Bash commands, file uploads, and downloads, with status responses returned to cell A1. Data transfer occurs via cells A2 to An, and the malware uses URL-safe Base64 encoding to evade detection.

UNC2814 has leveraged GRIDTIDE since at least 2017 to target telecommunications and government organizations worldwide.

Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) and its partners terminated all attacker-controlled Google Cloud Projects and accounts, disabled the UNC2814 infrastructure, and revoked access to Google Sheets API calls.

GTIG took coordinated action to disrupt UNC2814 and protect affected organizations. They terminated all attacker-controlled Cloud Projects, disabling GRIDTIDE backdoor access, and took down known UNC2814 infrastructure, including current and historical domains. Attacker accounts and Google Sheets access were revoked, and victim organizations were formally notified and supported. GTIG also refined detection signatures to block GRIDTIDE activity and released indicators of compromise (IOCs) used by UNC2814 since 2023, helping organizations worldwide identify and defend against this threat.

“The global scope of UNC2814’s activity, evidenced by confirmed or suspected operations in over 70 countries, underscores the serious threat facing telecommunications and government sectors, and the capacity for these intrusions to evade detection by defenders.” concludes the report. “Prolific intrusions of this scale are generally the result of years of focused effort and will not be easily re-established. We expect that UNC2814 will work hard to re-establish their global footprint.”

Untrusted repositories turn Claude code into an attack vector

Flaws in Anthropic’s Claude Code could allow remote code execution and theft of API keys when users open untrusted repositories.

Check Point Research team found multiple vulnerabilities in Anthropic’s Claude Code AI coding assistant that could lead to remote code execution and API key theft. The vulnerabilities abuse features such as Hooks, MCP servers, and environment variables to run arbitrary shell commands and exfiltrate Anthropic API credentials when users clone and open untrusted repositories.

“Critical vulnerabilities, CVE-2025-59536 and CVE-2026-21852, in Anthropic’s Claude Code enabled remote code execution and API key theft through malicious repository-level configuration files, triggered simply by cloning and opening an untrusted project.” reads the report published by Check Point Research.

“Built-in mechanisms—including Hooks, MCP integrations, and environment variables—could be abused to bypass trust controls, execute hidden shell commands, and redirect authenticated API traffic before user consent”

Researchers found that Claude Code’s project-level configuration files can act as an execution layer, allowing the attackers to abuse a single malicious repository as an attack vector. Simply cloning and opening a crafted repo could trigger hidden commands, bypass consent safeguards, steal Anthropic API keys, and pivot from a developer’s workstation into shared enterprise cloud environments, without visible warning.

The risks include silent command execution via abused Hooks, consent bypass in the Model Context Protocol (CVE-2025-59536), and API key exfiltration before trust confirmation (CVE-2026-21852), potentially exposing broader AI-driven workflows.

Anthropic’s API Workspaces feature lets multiple API keys share access to cloud-stored project files. Since files belong to the entire workspace and not just one API key, stealing a single key could let attackers access, change, or delete shared data, upload harmful content, and create unexpected charges. This behavior puts the whole team at risk, not just one developer.

The flaws highlight a new AI supply chain threat: repository configuration files now act as execution logic, so simply opening an untrusted project can trigger abuse. Anthropic addressed the issues by tightening trust prompts, blocking external tool execution, and restricting API calls until user approval.

“AI-powered coding tools are rapidly becoming part of enterprise development workflows. Their productivity benefits are significant, but so is the need to reassess traditional security assumptions.

Configuration files are no longer passive settings. They can influence execution, networking, and permissions.” concludes the report. “As AI integration deepens, security controls must evolve to match the new trust boundaries.”

Critical Zyxel router flaw exposed devices to remote attacks

Zyxel fixed a critical flaw in multiple routers that lets unauthenticated attackers remotely execute commands on vulnerable devices.

Zyxel addressed a critical remote code execution vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-13942 (CVSS score of 9.8), affecting more than a dozen router models.

A command injection flaw in the UPnP feature of several Zyxel CPEs, Fiber ONTs, and wireless extenders lets attackers run OS commands via crafted UPnP requests. Remote exploitation requires both WAN access and the vulnerable UPnP function to be enabled, as WAN access is disabled by default.

“A command injection vulnerability in the UPnP function of certain 4G LTE/5G NR CPE, DSL/Ethernet CPE, Fiber ONTs, and Wireless Extenders firmware versions could allow a remote attacker to execute operating system (OS) commands on an affected device by sending specially crafted UPnP SOAP requests.” reads the advisory published by the vendor. “It is important to note that WAN access is disabled by default on these devices, and the attack can be carried out remotely only if both WAN access and the vulnerable UPnP function have been enabled.”

CVE-2026-1459 affects several Zyxel DSL/Ethernet CPE router models, including DX5401-B1, EMG3525-T50B, EMG5523-T50B, VMG3625-T50B/C, and VMG8623-T50B running specified firmware versions and earlier. Zyxel plans to release patched firmware versions for all impacted models in March 2026.

The Taiwanese manufacturer also addressed other vulnerabilities affecting multiple Zyxel CPEs, Fiber ONTs, security routers, and wireless extenders. CVE-2025-11847 and CVE-2025-11848 are null pointer dereference flaws in IP settings and Wake-on-LAN CGI components that allow authenticated administrators to trigger a denial-of-service via crafted HTTP requests. CVE-2025-13943 and CVE-2026-1459 are post-authentication command injection bugs in log download and TR-369 certificate functions, enabling OS command execution. In all cases, WAN access remains disabled by default, and successful exploitation requires compromised administrator credentials.

The researcher Tiantai Zhang from Purdue University disclosed the vulnerabilities CVE-2025-11845, CVE-2025-11846, CVE-2025-11847, and CVE-2025-11848.

Víctor Fresco (@hacefresko) reported the flaws CVE-2025-13942 and CVE-2025-13943, while Watchful IP disclosed the flaw CVE-2026-1459.

Users are urged to update affected routers immediately to prevent exploitation.

ShinyHunters cyberattack on CarGurus impacts 12.4 Million users

ShinyHunters leaked data from 12.4M CarGurus accounts, exposing personal information from the U.S.-based auto research and shopping platform.

The ShinyHunters group published personal data from over 12 million CarGurus accounts. CarGurus is a U.S.-based digital automotive marketplace that helps users research, compare, and connect with sellers of new and used vehicles. Operating in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K., its platform analyzes listings to identify good deals and provides tools for pricing, dealer reviews, and vehicle history. The site attracts around 40 million monthly visitors and is publicly traded, making it a major player in online car shopping and automotive research.

In February 2026, CarGurus suffered a data breach that exposed personal information, including emails, account IDs, finance applications, dealer info, names, phone numbers, addresses, IPs, and auto finance application results after a failed extortion attempt.

On February 21, the ShinyHunters group leaked a 6.1GB compressed archive containing over 12.4 million records.

The data breach monitoring service HaveIBeenPwned (HIBP) also added CarGurus to its database.

New breach: CarGurus had more than 12M unique email addresses exposed in a breach earlier this month. Data also included names, phone numbers and physical and IP addresses. 70% were already in @haveibeenpwned. Read more: https://t.co/YkLIpKCGtp

Compromised data includes:

The CarGurus data breach poses multiple risks for customers. With personal information such as names, email addresses, phone numbers, and account IDs exposed, individuals face a heightened risk of phishing and social engineering attacks, as cybercriminals can craft convincing messages using real data. The leak of finance application details and other sensitive records also opens the door to identity theft and financial fraud. Exposed account information increases the likelihood of account takeovers, especially if users reuse passwords across platforms. Additionally, the disclosure of physical addresses and IP data raises privacy concerns, potentially enabling targeted marketing, stalking, or other malicious activity. Overall, these risks highlight the importance of vigilance, strong password hygiene, and monitoring for suspicious activity following the breach.

The ShinyHunters extortion group has recently targeted major companies, leaking data when ransom demands fail. Victims include Odido, Figure, Canada Goose, and SoundCloud. The group primarily uses social engineering, especially voice phishing, to steal credentials and access SaaS platforms like Salesforce, Okta, and Microsoft 365.

Former U.S. Defense contractor executive sentenced for selling zero-day exploits to Russian broker Operation Zero

A former employee at U.S. defense contractor L3Harris got over 7 years in prison for selling eight zero-days to a Russian broker.

Peter Williams, a 39-year-old Australian former L3Harris employee, received a prison sentence of just over seven years for selling eight zero-day exploits to the Russian broker Operation Zero for millions. Williams pleaded guilty in October 2025 to two counts of trade secret theft. The court also imposed three years of supervised release and ordered him to forfeit assets, including property, luxury items, and cryptocurrency proceeds.

“Today, Peter Williams, 39, an Australian national, was sentenced in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to 87 months in prison for selling his employer’s trade secrets — sensitive and protected cyber-exploit components — to a Russian cyber-tools broker, announced the Department of Justice.” reads the press release published by DoJ. “In addition to the 87-month prison term, U.S. District Court Judge AliKhan for the District of Columbia ordered Williams to serve three years of supervised release with special conditions, to forfeit a money judgment of $1.3 million, cryptocurrency and property to include a house, and luxury items such as watches and jewelry. The Court also set a restitution hearing for May 12, 2026.”

In October 2025, the journalist Kim Zetter revealed the case’s connection to Operation Zero, which had occurred the previous year.

“The former executive of Trenchant who pleaded guilty this week to selling his company’s software hacking tools to a zero-day broker in Russia, sold at least one of these tools to the Russian firm even after learning that a previous tool he sold the broker was being used by a South Korean broker – indicating that the stolen tools were being passed on to others downstream.” wrote Zetter. “In June 2025, he signed an agreement with the Russian buyer to sell stolen code for $500,000 and transmitted the code to the buyer just days before he met with the FBI to discuss their investigation in to the theft of Trenchant’s code.”

Trenchant sells zero-day exploits and advanced hacking tools exclusively to the U.S. government and a limited group of allied governments, likely including Australia. Williams worked for the Australian Signals Directorate in the 2010s, conducting cyber espionage similar to the U.S. NSA. After leaving ASD, he joined a company that later became L3Trenchant. The firm emerged in 2018 after L3Harris acquired Australian exploit developers Azimuth and Linchpin Labs, both known for supplying zero-days and hacking tools to the U.S. and allied governments.

Court documents say the stolen exploits could target civilian and military victims worldwide, enabling fraud, ransomware, espionage, and offensive cyber operations. According to court documents, Williams abused his senior role and sold the tools for up to $4 million in cryptocurrency, potentially exposing millions of devices. Over three years, from 2022 to 2025, eight zero-day exploit components were stolen from L3Harris. The tools, intended only for the U.S. government and select allies, caused an estimated $35 million in losses.

“Williams took trade secrets comprised of national security software and sold them for up to $4 million in crypto currency. These incredibly powerful tools would have allowed Russia to access millions of digital devices,” said U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro for the District of Columbia. “By betraying a position of trust and selling sensitive American technology, Williams’ crime is not only one of theft, it is a crime of national security. Our nation’s defense capabilities are not commodities to be auctioned off. People like Williams who endanger our national security will be met with swift and decisive consequences.”

The U.S. State Department designated Operation Zero, its director Sergey Sergeyevich Zelenyuk, and Special Technology Services LLC FZ (STS) under the Protecting American Intellectual Property Act over the stolen trade secrets. Zelenyuk, a Russian national, founded STS in the UAE to expand operations across Asia and the Middle East and likely bypass U.S. sanctions.

OFAC is sanctioning individuals and companies linked to Zelenyuk, including his assistant Marina Vasanovich and UAE-based STS, for acting on his behalf. Azizjon Mamashoyev and Oleg Kucherov, former Operation Zero associates—with Kucherov tied to the Trickbot gang—are also designated for materially supporting Zelenyuk. Advance Security Solutions, Mamashoyev’s UAE/Uzbekistan exploit brokerage, is sanctioned for similar reasons.

Russian national Sergey Zelenyuk has run Operation Zero, based in St. Petersburg, since 2021 as an exploit broker. The company offers large bounties for exploits targeting widely used software, including U.S. operating systems and encrypted messaging apps, without notifying developers, allowing customers to use them for ransomware or other malicious activities.

“In advertisements and other public-facing materials, Zelenyuk and Operation Zero have stated that they will only sell the exploits they acquire to customers from non-NATO countries.  Zelenyuk, through Operation Zero, has sought to sell exploits to foreign intelligence agencies.  Zelenyuk and Operation Zero have also sought to develop other cyber intelligence systems, including spyware and methods to extract personal identifying information and other sensitive data uploaded by users of artificial intelligence applications like large language models.” reads the press release by the US Treasury. “Operation Zero has sought to recruit hackers to support its activities and develop business relationships with foreign intelligence agencies through use of social media.”

U.S. CISA adds a flaw in Soliton Systems K.K FileZen to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog

The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) adds a flaw in Soliton Systems K.K FileZen to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog.

The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) added a Soliton Systems K.K FileZen flaw, tracked as CVE-2026-25108 (CVSS v4 score of 8.7), to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog.

Soliton Systems K.K. FileZen is a secure file transfer solution that enables organizations to share and manage sensitive data safely. It provides access controls, activity logging, and antivirus scanning.

The vulnerability is an operating system (OS) command injection that could allow an authenticated user to execute arbitrary commands via specially crafted HTTP requests.

“Command Injection Vulnerability in a Specific Field on the Post-Logon Screen (CWE-78)” reads the advisory. “A remote attacker may be able to execute arbitrary OS commands within FileZen.”

The vulnerability can be exploited only if two conditions are met: the FileZen virus check feature (BitDefender-based) is enabled, and an attacker has valid login access to the FileZen website, either through leaked credentials or successfully guessed user IDs and passwords.

The flaw impacts Versions 5.0.0 to 5.0.10 and Versions 4.2.1 to 4.2.8. V5.0.11 or later address the flaw.

Soliton is aware of the active exploitation of this flaw:

“We have received at least one report of damage caused by the exploitation of this vulnerability.” reads the advisory. “For this vulnerability to occur, an attacker must log on to the web screen with general user privileges. If you have been attacked or suspected of being a victim of this vulnerability, please consider not only updating to V5.0.11 or later, but also changing all user passwords as a precaution, since an attacker could log on with at least one real account.”

According to Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities, FCEB agencies have to address the identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect their networks against attacks exploiting the flaws in the catalog.

Experts also recommend that private organizations review the Catalog and address the vulnerabilities in their infrastructure.

CISA orders federal agencies to fix the vulnerability by March 17, 2026.

Lazarus APT group deployed Medusa Ransomware against Middle East target

North Korea’s Lazarus Group used Medusa ransomware in an attack on an unnamed Middle East organization, researchers report.

The North Korea-linked Lazarus APT Group, also known as Diamond Sleet and Pompilus, has been spotted deploying Medusa ransomware against an unnamed organization in the Middle East, according a new report from the Symantec and Carbon Black Threat Hunter Team.

“North Korea has long been involved in ransomware attacks and has been previously associated with the Maui and Play ransomware families. However, the Symantec and Carbon Black Threat Hunter Team has uncovered evidence North Korean actors using Medusa in an attack on a target in the Middle East.” reads the report published by Symantec and Carbon Black Threat Hunter Team. “The same attackers also mounted an unsuccessful attack against a healthcare organization in the U.S.”

Medusa, a ransomware-as-a-service launched in 2023 and operated by the Spearwing group, allows affiliates to deploy the malware in exchange for a share of ransom payments. It has been linked to over 366 claimed attacks. Since early November 2025, its leak site has listed four U.S. healthcare and non-profit victims, including a mental health nonprofit and a school for autistic children. Average ransom demands reached $260,000.

North Korea’s Lazarus subgroup Stonefly (aka Andariel) has shifted from traditional espionage to ransomware-driven extortion in recent years. Its role became public in July 2025, when U.S. authorities indicted alleged member Rim Jong Hyok over attacks on American hospitals. Prosecutors said ransomware proceeds funded espionage targeting defense, tech, and government sectors in the U.S., Taiwan, and South Korea. Despite charges and a $10 million reward, activity continued, including financially motivated intrusions in 2024 and reported collaboration with the Play ransomware group.

In current campaigns, Lazarus deploys tools such as Comebacker, Blindingcan, ChromeStealer, Mimikatz, and other custom malware. While the Medusa attacks are attributed to Lazarus, it remains unclear which subgroup is responsible, as the toolset overlaps with groups like Pompilus.

“The switch to Medusa demonstrates that North Korea’s rapacious involvement in cybercrime continues unabated.” concludes the report that provides Indicators of Compromise (IoCs). “North Korean actors appear to have few scruples about targeting organizations in the U.S. While some cybercrime outfits claim to steer clear of targeting healthcare organizations due to the reputational damage it may attract, Lazaurs doesn’t seem to be in any way constrained.”

[29] Graham Cluley - Notorious ransomware gang allegedly blackmailed by fake FSB officer

[TAM METİN - 421 kelime]
There is a certain poetic justice in a cybersecurity-related story that has emerged from Moscow this week: A man has been accused of trying to extort money... from a notorious Russian ransomware gang.

Conti, one of the world's most infamous cybercriminal operations, was allegedly the victim of an attempted scam by someone pretending to be an officer of Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB).

According to a report by Russian news outlet RBC, a Moscow resident named Ruslan Satuchin allegedly contacted a member of the Conti cybercriminal group in September 2022, and claimed to have influence over law enforcement's investigation into the gang.

Satuchin is alleged to have made a simple offer to Conti: pay up, or face criminal consequences. The irony that a ransomware group with a history of extorting money from hacked organisations was itself being extorted is surely not lost on anybody.

Satuchin has denied any wrongdoing, and he is reportedly being held in pre-trial detention in Moscow after police argued successfully that he should remain in custody to avoid the possibility of witness intimidation.

If convicted, Satuchin faces up to ten years in prison and a fine of up to one million rubles (approximately US $13,000)

At its peak, Conti was a professional cybercriminal enterprise, earning eye-watering amounts of money by blackmailing organisations including governments, businesses, and hospitals worldwide.

The Irish Health Service Executive alone estimated recovery costs from a Conti attack in 2021 at over US $600 million after it was hit in 2021.

The inner workings of the Conti group were revealed in 2022 when a pro-Ukraine researcher published tens of thousands of the gang's leaked chat logs, source code, and infrastructure documents. That data reinforced long-standing suspicions that the Conti group deliberately avoided Russian targets, and aligned itself with the interests of the Kremlin.

Which makes the idea of someone impersonating an FSB officer to shake them down all the more remarkable. You'd need extraordinary nerve — or extraordinary naivety — to try blackmailing a criminal organisation that many believed enjoyed protection from the Russian state.

After the leak, Conti largely collapsed - although individuals associated with the wider network are thought to have moved to other ransomware operations including Royal, Black Basta, and Akira.

In 2023, sanctions brought by the United States and UK formally named key members linked to Conti.

Conti's victims paid a heavy price for the gang's activities. It is, at least, mildly satisfying to learn that even ransomware gangs occasionally find themselves on the receiving end of someone else's scheme.

When the mysterious operator of an internet archiving-service decided to silence a curious Finnish blogger, they didn’t just send a stroppy email – they allegedly weaponised their own CAPTCHA page to launch a DDoS attack, threatened to invent an entirely new genre of AI porn, and tampered with parts of their own archive to smear the blogger’s name.

In this episode, we unravel how a website designed to preserve history may have trashed its own credibility – and how Wikipedia responded when trust went out the window.

Plus a ransomware gang shoots itself in the foot with a classic case of buffoonery, accidentally corrupting the very keys victims would need to decrypt their data. When even the criminals can’t unlock your files, what happens next?

All this, a surprisingly zen Pick of the Week, and a gloriously splenetic rant against web forms, on episode 456 of the award-winning “Smashing Security” podcast, with cybersecurity veteran Graham Cluley and special guest Paul Ducklin.

[31] Graham Cluley - $10,000 bounty offered if you can hack Ring cameras to stop them sharing your data with Amazon
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[TAM METİN - 443 kelime]
Did you watch this year's Super Bowl? If you did, maybe you're one of those who were sat at your sofa fuming about Ring camera's TV ad.

The ad focuses on Ring's new "Search Party" feature - an AI-driven feature that is designed to help locate lost pets by enlisting nearby video doorbells and cameras. In the ad, a family's dog goes missing, and Ring cameras across the neighbourhood scan their footage in search of the animal.

Ring probably hoped that the ad would sell the "Search Party" feature in a heartwarming way. But, in reality, many people were freaked out that technology was once again proving itself to be huge privacy concern.

As one person commented on social media as the backlash to the ad began:

Another Ring owner posted on Reddit:

Others posted videos of themselves destroying their Ring devices in protest, and online forums were ablaze with discussions about data ownership and consent.

And it's against that backdrop that the Fulu Foundation, a nonprofit organisation focused on device ownership rights, has offered a US $10,000 bounty for anyone who can find a way to run Ring doorbell cameras locally, cutting off the flow of video data to Amazon's servers.

The Fulu Foundation is not offering a bounty in the traditional sense of hunting for a security vulnerability that can be patched. Instead, any winner of the bounty will need to demonstrate a method that allows affected Ring cameras to operate locally and redirect footage to the owner's own computer or server, without transmitting video footage to Amazon's cloud services.

In short, the goal is to give Ring camera owners greater control over where their footage goes.

"In an ideal world, device owners would be able to modify that software to instead push that footage to their own computer or server, should they so choose," said Kevin O'Reilly of the Fulu Foundation. "

This isn't the first time Ring has found itself in hot water over privacy.

For instance, in 2023 the US Federal Trade Commission alleged that Ring failed to adequately protect customers' privacy and security, including allowing employees access to customer videos.

One employee was reported to have viewed thousands of recordings of women in their bedrooms and bathrooms. Ring was ultimately required to make US $5.8 million worth of refunds to customers as a result, as well as delete unlawfully obtained videos, and implement stronger privacy and security protocols.

Whether anyone ultimately claims the bounty remains to be seen. But the underlying question isn't going away: if you've bought a security camera, shouldn't you be the one deciding where its footage ends up, and how it is used?

Finding Signal in the Noise: Lessons Learned Running a Honeypot with AI Assistance [Guest Diary]

[This is a Guest Diary by Austin Bodolay, an ISC intern as part of the SANS.edu BACS program]

Over the past several months, I have gained practical insight into the challenges of deploying and operating a honeypot, even within a relatively simple environment. This work highlighted how varying hardware, software, and network design—can significantly alter outcomes. Through this process, I observed both the value and the limitations of log collection. Comprehensive telemetry proved essential for understanding activity targeting the honeypot, yet it also became clear that improperly scoped or poorly interpreted logs can produce misleading conclusions. Prior to this research, I had almost no interaction with AI tools and struggled to identify practical ways to integrate them into my work. Throughout this experience, however, AI proved most valuable not as an automated solution, but as a collaborative aid—providing quick syntax on the CLI, offering alternative perspectives, and helping maintain analytical focus.

The DShield honeypot is a sensor that pretends to be a vulnerable system exposed to the internet. It collects information from scans and attacks that are often automated, providing insight to analyst what threat actors are targeting and how. The honeypot generates a large amount of data, much of it low-value.  Deciding what is meaningful, what separate events are related, and what (if any) actions should be taken. Being able to accurately assess the data requires the right information. And in the event a true incident does occur, being able to piece together the breadcrumbs requires the data is actually there. Piecing it all together requires the right methodology. Using an AI, like ChatGPT, is extremely helpful in tying these concepts together.

The Data: What Was Collected and Why

In the few months my SIEM has collected 8 million logs from 14,000 unique IP addresses. There is a lot of noise on the internet from automated scanners and toolkits that frequently repeat the same actions to every device willing to listen. This constant "background noise" on the internet are systems constantly scanning for what is available, what is potentially vulnerable, and what is low hanging fruit that can provide a foothold for something more. Is there an exposed administrative panel? Do these default credentials work anywhere? And if so, what does information does this hold or what does it have access to? Is this a developer? Does the system have private information worth value? The honeypot sensor provides a way to analyze this traffic to better understand what threat actors are after and how they are going after it.

The basic information that is collected on the honeypot includes source IP addresses, port, protocol, URL, and a few other metrics. The logs primarily record the traffic that was sent to the honeypot. If your router dropped the packets or failed to send them to the honeypot, the logs will not be generated to be sent to the SIEM. The NetFlow logs add a little extra information, like the direction of the packets, the byte count, and packets that were dropped before reaching the honeypot. What my current system does not show is the actual payloads in the traffic, the headers of packets, or the exploit details. ChatGPT helped identify what type of data I actually have, what types of conclusions can be drawn from this data, and methods to validate these conclusions. ChatGPT also identified dead ends early on, saving me time from going down rabbit holes by pointing out the current data will never be able to positively affirm any conclusion.

I came across a log that raised some concerns. After providing simple details of the devices involved, the type of log generated, clarifying the log is on the gateway and not the SIEM, and the values recorded in the data, ChatGPT provided insights as to what likely generated this traffic and why it likely isn't an alternative event. I performed additional research to confirm this information is true.

Interaction with ChatGPT

Researching a unique User-Agent "libredtail-http", I began checking a high level how frequently this shows up. I noticed that in several months of logs, this User-Agent appeared for the first time on my sensor in December of 2025. There are 34 unique IP addresses that have used it, most of which have less than 100 events. Interestingly, all events occur on the same days, with up to 2 weeks of silence between the next set of events. Additionally, the URL request and payload sizes were identical among all events, regardless of the source IP address. When researching the User-Agent string "libredtail-http", I came across many articles about malware. Sharing some of the information found with ChatGPT, it quickly identified what I was likely seeing, who it is targeting, what makes an event vulnerable to the attacks, and how to protect from them. More likely than malware, what I was seeing is an automated multi-staged toolkit that is scanning the internet for vulnerable Apache servers, Linux web interfaces, and IoT devices. The source of scans is using low-cost methods to rotate through IP addresses, combined with intermittent campaign timing (burst -> idle -> burst) to reduce detection and attribution. This is likely a botnet and the goal is to enroll new systems into the botnet for additional scanners, proxies, and DDoS nodes. I then began researching this information, such as the CVE mentioned by ChatGPT, indicators of compromise (IOCs), and comparing various sources to what I have in my logs to validate the accuracy of the statements. The responses were very accurate. Had I not used ChatGPT, I would have started searching for IOCs in my logs for signs of malware mentioned in the articles and possibly wasted several hours. I likely would have come to a similar conclusion, but I admit it would have used a lot of my time.

Interaction with ChatGPT based on findings above.

I have found the most value comes by clearly stating what your objective is. The more details provided early on reduce vague answers.

Conclusion and Lessons Learned

Having more logs doesn't equal more answers. If a system is comprised and reaches out to a malicious server, having logs of only incoming traffic won't ever catch this malicious activity. And if you have logs showing a connection with a large volume of data outgoing, but the logs don't include the actual content in the packets, it's nearly impossible to know what was actually inside those packets. And if you are tasked with reviewing tens of thousands or millions of logs, it’s nice to have some help. Consider the use of central logging, something like a SIEM, combined with reaching out to a team member for some help if you are part of a team.

The CLAIR Model: A Synthesized Conceptual Framework for Mapping Critical Infrastructure Interdependencies [Guest Diary]

[This is a guest diary contributed by Claire Perry (LinkedIn)]

The structural integrity of modern society is predicated upon a dense and often opaque network of interconnected systems. For decades, the modeling of these systems remained siloed within specific domains: industrial processes were governed by the hierarchical constraints of the Purdue Model, while corporate and data-centric ecosystems were organized using various Enterprise Architecture (EA) frameworks (Fortinet, n.d.; The Open Group, n.d.). However, the accelerating convergence of Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT) has exposed a critical analytical gap. Disruptions in the external utility grid, once considered an unlikely factor, now propagate through the physical and logical layers of the enterprise with devastating speed, as evidenced by recent power-related disconnections of large-scale data center operations (Mural et al., 2026; Islam et al., 2023).

To bridge this gap, this report introduces the Comprehensive Linkage and Architectural Infrastructure Resiliency (CLAIR) Model. The CLAIR Model is a new conceptual framework that synthesizes the vertical depth of the Purdue Enterprise Reference Architecture (PERA) with the multi-dimensional, interrogative breadth of the Zachman Framework for Enterprise Architecture (Fortinet, n.d.; The Open Group, n.d.). By establishing a unified taxonomy that accounts for everything from the sub-physical utility grid to the hyper-distributed cloud, the CLAIR Model provides a structured scope for identifying and visualizing critical infrastructure interdependencies. This framework prioritizes the identification of these linkages over specific mitigations, offering a diagnostic tool for understanding how failures in one sector, such as the power grid, generate cascading effects across the data center and manufacturing landscapes (Fortinet, n.d.; Islam et al., 2023; Virginia Department of Emergency Management, n.d.).

Historical Context and the Necessity of Synthesis

The conceptual origin of industrial modeling lies in the 1990s at Purdue University, where researchers developed the Purdue Enterprise Reference Architecture (PERA) to standardize computer-integrated manufacturing (Fortinet, n.d.). The Purdue Model established a functional hierarchy ranging from Level 0 (physical processes) to Level 4 (business logistics), effectively creating an "automation pyramid." Isolation of sensitive controllers from internet-facing business networks is typically achieved via a "demilitarized zone" (DMZ) at Level 3.5 (Fortinet, n.d.).

While the Purdue Model excels at describing the internal dependencies of a single plant, it is inherently insular. It treats the external world as a series of inputs (Level 0) or external services (Level 5) without mapping the complex, bidirectional relationships between the plant and the broader infrastructure (Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, 2025a; Williams, 1994). In parallel, Enterprise Architecture (EA) frameworks like Zachman were developed to organize the design artifacts of complex organizations from multiple stakeholder perspectives (The Open Group, n.d.). The CLAIR Model recognizes that neither framework, in isolation, can characterize the risks of a "system-of-systems" environment (Department of Defense, 2008). In modern critical infrastructure, a data center is not merely a facility at Level 4 of the Purdue Model; it is a massive electric load at the intersection of global telecommunications, regional power grids, and local water supply systems (UK Parliament, 2025; Chen et al., 2025). Failure to understand these dynamics results in ineffective response and poor coordination between decision-makers (Dudenhoeffer et al., 2006).

The CLAIR Model: Structural Hierarchy and Extended Levels

The CLAIR Model expands the traditional five-level Purdue hierarchy into a ten-level architectural stack. This expansion is designed to capture the "Level -1" dependencies on primary utility infrastructure and the "Level 6" and "Level 7" dependencies on cloud and safety systems (CISA, 2025a; Russo, 2022).

Level -1: The Primary Infrastructure Foundation

The inclusion of Level -1 acknowledges that the "physics" of Level 0 is entirely dependent on a primary technology layer that exists outside the control of the plant operator (Islam et al., 2023). In the CLAIR Model, Level -1 encompasses the electricity generation and transmission systems, which exhibit complex dynamic behaviors such as low inertia and harmonic distortion when interfacing with data center power electronics (Chen et al., 2025). This layer is the source of cascading failure triggers, where a line fault in the high-voltage grid necessitates immediate load redistribution, often leading to voltage fluctuations that destabilize Level 0 sensors and Level 1 controllers (Islam et al., 2023).

Levels 0-5: What Can Be Controlled

Levels 0–5 are generally within the organization’s direct control because the systems, assets, and processes at these layers are typically owned and/or administered by the business, company, or government entity. However, even within this “control zone,” organizations still inherit external dependencies, especially for software, firmware, and operating systems that rely on vendor-provided patches and updates. If an update is delayed, unavailable, or operationally difficult to deploy, the organization may remain exposed to known vulnerabilities or be forced to rely on temporary mitigations until a corrective patch can be implemented (Souppaya & Scarfone, 2022). As a result, these layers may appear internally controlled while quietly depending on upstream providers and external services that introduce risk across otherwise well-managed environments.

Level 6 and 7: The Distributed Sovereignty

As organizations move toward "Smart Factories" and "Hyperscale Data Centers," the reliance on Level 6 (The Connected World) becomes absolute (CISA, 2025a). This level includes the Cloud-Fog-Edge computing model, where instant processing occurs at the edge but long-term analytics and orchestration reside in the cloud (CISA, 2025a). Level 7 represents the "Safety and High-Trust" layer, which is isolated even from the corporate enterprise to ensure that catastrophic failures at lower levels do not prevent a safe system shutdown (Russo, 2022). Level 7 are systems or items that are critical to restoration of levels 0-6 within the organization. The loss of level 7 is a catastrophic issue.

Integrating Enterprise Architecture: The CLAIR MatrixLinkeIn)

The CLAIR Model maps its ten levels against the six interrogatives of the Zachman Framework to identify dependencies across different dimensions of the infrastructure (The Open Group, n.d.).

The What (Data and Resource Flow): At the lower levels (-1 to 1), "data" is often a physical resource flow, such as electrons or water pressure (VA DEM, n.d.). At the higher levels (4 to 6), it transitions into digital information payloads (Macaulay, 2025)

The How (Operational Function): This dimension describes the transformation processes, from ladder logic at Level 1 to machine learning algorithms at Level 6 (CISA, 2025a; Australian Signals Directorate, 2024).

The Where (Network and Spatial Distribution): This captures geographic interdependencies (Dudenhoeffer et al., 2006). A physical collapse of a pylon destroys both the power source (Level -1) and the communication path (Level 3) sharing that pylon (Islam et al., 2023; VA DEM, n.d.).

The Who (Stakeholder and Actor Matrix): Maps "managerial independencies" where a Distribution System Operator (DSO) at Level -1 must coordinate with a corporate CIO at Level 5 and a third-party cloud provider at Level 6 (DoD, 2008; Islam et al., 2023).

The When (Temporal Dynamics): Visualizes the "transient response" during a failure, showing how a grid frequency deviation at Level -1 propagates through the stack faster than a Level 2 supervisory system can respond (Islam et al., 2023; Shuvro et al., 2023).

The Why (Motivation and Strategy): Identifies where business goals conflict, such as a utility shedding load to save the grid versus a data center's 99.999% availability goal (Mural et al., 2026; The Open Group, n.d.).

Case Study: Power Grid Failures and Data Center Operations

The CLAIR Model demonstrates that power grid failures are not merely physical events; they are systemic crises. Data centers are emerging as prominent large electric loads with demand patterns characterized by high power density (Mural et al., 2026; Chen et al., 2025).

The Mechanism of Cascading Failure

A cascading failure is a sequence where one component malfunction triggers successive failures in a "domino mechanism" (Islam et al., 2023). Within the CLAIR framework:

The Trigger (Level -1): A disturbance, such as a transmission line failure, occurs in the utility grid (Shuvro et al., 2023).

Load Redistribution: The grid redistributes flow, but because data centers have massive, steady loads, this can push remaining infrastructure beyond capacity (Mural et al., 2026; Islam et al., 2023).

Voltage Fluctuations: A sudden fluctuation in Northern Virginia recently triggered the simultaneous disconnection of 60 data centers, creating a 1,500-megawatt (MW) power surplus almost instantly (Mural et al., 2026).

Information Blindness: As power fails, the cyber network monitoring the grid may also fail. If cloud-based analytics (Level 6) lose connectivity, operators lose visibility, leading to erroneous adjustments and a total blackout (Islam et al., 2023; CISA, 2025a).

Identifying Dependencies: A Typological Deep-Dive

The CLAIR Model categorizes every identified link into a matrix of dependency types. This taxonomy is essential for understanding the nature of the vulnerability.

Sankey Flow Maps for Dependency Visualization

To visualize inbound and outbound data dependencies, organizations can use Sankey Flow Maps; flow diagrams that represent transfers or reliance relationships using variable-width links, where wider flows indicate greater magnitude or criticality (Schmidt, 2008). Rather than ranking sensitivities as standalone bars, this method makes dependency direction and coupling immediately visible by placing the system-of-interest at the center and showing weighted flows entering and exiting it.

Inbound dependencies (inputs to the system): The external data, services, or control-plane functions that the system relies on to operate (e.g., identity assertions, routing/DNS, upstream connectivity, threat intelligence feeds).

Outbound dependencies (outputs from the system): The downstream systems, users, or business processes that rely on the system’s outputs (e.g., hosted applications/APIs, telemetry to security monitoring, billing/FinOps data).

In practice, each flow can be assigned a dependency “weight” (e.g., criticality, volume, recovery difficulty, or a composite score), enabling teams to quickly identify high-consequence dependencies and prioritize resilience, monitoring, redundancy, and governance controls.

AI as an Interdependency Vector in the CLAIR Model

The integration of AI across levels creates new interdependencies. AI models at the operational layers (0-3) introduce risks such as data quality dependency, model drift, and an explainability gap (ASD, 2024). To maintain resilience, the CLAIR Model incorporates operational constraints like the "80% bandwidth rule," ensuring that data aggregation for AI training does not exceed network capacity to protect critical control signals at Level 1 (ASD, 2024).

AI-OT Convergence Risks

When AI models are deployed at the operational layers (0-3), they introduce failure mechanisms not present in traditional deterministic system:

Data Quality Dependency: AI models at Level 1 depend on the normalization and quality of sensor data from Level 0. If the sensors are compromised (even at the physics level), the AI will make decisions based on untrusted data.

Model Drift Dependency: Over time, alterations to production processes can cause an AI model to drift from its initial training. This creates a temporal dependency where the model must be periodically updated from Level 6, creating a cyber-linkage that bypasses the DMZ.

Explainability Gap: In a crisis, if an AI-driven controller at Level 1 fails or takes an unexpected action, the "Lack of Explainability" increases the operator's recovery time, potentially allowing a local failure to cascade into a regional one.

National Security and Policy Frameworks: The Institutional Why

The "Why" of the CLAIR Model is increasingly driven by policy, such as the National Security Memorandum on Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience (NSM-22) (Congressional Research Service, 2024). This framework groups infrastructure functions into four areas: connect, distribute, manage, and supply, which the CLAIR Model maps to specific assets and their dependencies across the stack (CRS, 2024; CISA, 2025b).Maturity and Assessment in the CLAIR Framework

To evaluate the strength of identified dependencies, the CLAIR Model adopts maturity indicator levels (International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], 2021).

Impact on Dependency Risk Real-time visualization across the entire stack

A key insight is that resilience is only as strong as its weakest link. If a data center has MIL 3 resilience at Level 5 but relies on a Level -1 power source with MIL 0 monitoring, the overall system resilience is effectively MIL 0 (IAEA, 2021).

Conclusion: Visualizing the Interconnected World

The CLAIR Model synthesis of the Purdue Model and Enterprise Architecture moves beyond a narrow view of internal security toward a holistic understanding of infrastructure interdependencies (CISA, 2025a). It demonstrates that the impact of a power grid failure on data centers is multi-dimensional, involving transients at Level -1, sensor failure at Level 0, and business discontinuity at Level 4 (Mural et al., 2026; Islam et al., 2023). By focusing on these linkages, from the physics of the grid to the logic of the cloud, architects can finally visualize the "walking failures" that define our interconnected world (Islam et al., 2023; CISA, 2025b).

Recorded Future Expands Coverage of Scams and Financial Fraud with Money Mule Intelligence from CYBERA

Recorded Future is expanding its payment fraud prevention capabilities through a partnership with CYBERA, the industry leader in detecting and verifying data on scam-linked bank accounts.

Available for purchase now via the Recorded Future Platform, Money Mule Intelligence helps fraud teams identify the accounts criminals use to extract and move stolen funds—addressing a critical gap as scams increasingly become banks' most pressing fraud challenge.

The Growing Threat of Authorized Push Payment Fraud

Authorized Push Payment (APP) fraud is accelerating. In the U.S., APP fraud losses are projected to reach nearly $15B by 2028, up from $8.3B in 2024, according to Deloitte. While traditional card fraud continues to decline, APP fraud is climbing, fueled by AI-generated deepfakes, personalized scam scripts, and instant payment systems like FedNow and Zelle that move money faster than conventional fraud controls can intercept it.

Mule accounts, or money mules, are part of the critical infrastructure that makes these scams possible. They provide the bridge that converts stolen payments into untraceable cash or cryptocurrency. Without them, most APP fraud would collapse because criminals cannot risk receiving funds directly into their own accounts. By the time victims realize they've been scammed, mule accounts have already moved the money through multiple layers, typically ending in cash withdrawals or crypto conversions.

Additionally, the sophistication of mule operations is increasing. Criminal organizations now employ "mule herders" who manage hundreds of accounts at once, using AI to simulate normal transaction behavior (grocery purchases, streaming subscriptions, etc.) so accounts don't appear dormant or suspicious. This makes detection through traditional pattern analysis increasingly difficult.

Regulators are responding by shifting liability to banks, often viewing those allowing mule accounts to operate as part of the criminal infrastructure itself. For example, the UK now requires banks to reimburse scam victims and allows them to delay suspicious payments for investigation, while U.S. regulators are signaling that banks may be held liable for failing to detect mule accounts.

Detecting mule accounts is fundamentally difficult. They’re designed to blend in with legitimate activity, and traditional fraud controls can struggle to distinguish between a genuine customer payment and a scam transfer until it's too late.

CYBERA's Approach to Mule Intelligence

The challenge of detecting and disrupting mule account networks is what led CYBERA's founders to build their solution. Coming from legal practice and law enforcement, CYBERA's leadership team worked scam cases where they witnessed how recovery becomes impossible once funds move through the financial system. They realized that money mule networks represent a central vulnerability in the scam economy, one that banks had limited visibility into.

Today, CYBERA helps banks and payment networks disrupt scams at the point where funds are extracted. CYBERA's AI-powered Scam Engagement System generates intelligence on bank accounts and payment endpoints actively used by scam networks.

Unlike probabilistic risk scoring, CYBERA verifies each account, providing evidence and contextual metadata to enable proactive prevention across both internal accounts and outbound payments while minimizing false positives.

CYBERA supports two core use cases:

On-Us Mule Detection, which helps identify mule accounts held at your institution that are already linked to confirmed scam activity. This enables early detection and disruption of high-risk accounts, reducing downstream fraud, repeat victimization, and regulatory exposure within a bank’s accountholders.

Off-Us Screening, which screens outbound payments to external beneficiary accounts before execution, helping to prevent customers from sending funds to scammer-controlled accounts. This is particularly valuable for high-value transfers, social engineering attacks, and customer-initiated payments where traditional controls are limited.

Large financial institutions have already prevented multiple six-figure losses by embedding CYBERA’s intelligence into their transaction monitoring workflows. CYBERA has also been accepted as a member of the Mastercard Start Path program, making it the first Recorded Future partner to achieve this distinction and further validating its role in the payments ecosystem.

How Money Mule Intelligence Expands Payment Fraud Intelligence

Payment Fraud Intelligence (PFI) correlates the widest set of disparate, pre-monetization indicators of fraud to help teams act before their customers are impacted. Money Mule Intelligence extends that capability, giving fraud teams the verified intelligence needed to make high-confidence decisions that disrupt scams by flagging accounts that have been confirmed as mule infrastructure through direct investigation. Together, they provide coverage from initial compromise through attempted cash-out, helping fraud teams prevent losses at multiple intervention points.

Chief Product Officer at Recorded Future

As regulators increasingly expect banks to prevent scam-enabled transfers, Money Mule Intelligence provides the verified data needed to comply with emerging reimbursement requirements while reducing the operational burden of post-incident investigation and remediation.

PFI users that purchase this capability, can now act on both sides of the transaction—compromised payment instruments and scam-linked receiving accounts—with evidence-backed intelligence that minimizes false positives and aligns with the industry's shift toward proactive fraud prevention.

[37] Cyberscoop - Governments issue warning over Cisco zero-day attacks dating back to 2023

Governments issue warning over Cisco zero-day attacks dating back to 2023

Attackers have been exploiting a pair of zero-day vulnerabilities in Cisco’s network edge software for at least three years, and the global campaign is ongoing, authorities said across a series of warnings released Wednesday.

The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency issued an emergency directive about the global attacks and issued joint guidance with the Five Eyes to help defenders respond and hunt for evidence of compromise.

This marks the second series of multiple actively exploited zero-day vulnerabilities in Cisco edge technology since last spring. Both campaigns resulted in CISA emergency directives months after the attacks were first detected, and both attack sprees were underway for at least a year before they were identified.

Authorities refrained from attributing the attacks to any nation state or threat group. Cisco Talos researchers assigned the exploits and post-compromise activity to UAT-8616, which they only described as a “highly sophisticated threat actor.”

The activity cluster’s “attempted exploitation indicates a continuing trend of the targeting of network edge devices by cyber threat actors to establish persistent footholds into high-value organizations including critical infrastructure sectors,” Cisco Talos said in a threat advisory.

Malicious activity linked to this campaign is far reaching and attackers have exploited vulnerabilities in targeted systems to access and potentially compromise federal networks, Nick Andersen, CISA’s executive assistant director for cybersecurity, said during a media briefing Wednesday.

Andersen declined to say when CISA was first aware of this activity and did not provide details about potential victims, adding that officials are working through the beginning stages of mitigation.

In the jointly issued threat hunt guide, the Five Eyes said all members were aware that the most recent zero-day — CVE-2026-20127 — was identified and confirmed actively exploited in late 2025. Officials and Cisco did not explain why it took at least two months to disclose and patch the vulnerability, and share emergency mitigation guidance.

Attackers are gaining full control of a system in a chain by exploiting CVE-2026-20127 to bypass authentication, then downgrading software to a version vulnerable to CVE-2022-20775 to escalate privileges, said Douglass McKee, director of vulnerability intelligence at Rapid7.

“That second step allows them to move from administrative control to root on the underlying operating system. That downgrade step shows deliberate knowledge of product versioning and patch history,” he told CyberScoop. “This is not opportunistic scanning. This is structured tradecraft.”

CISA added CVE-2022-20775 and CVE-2026-20127 to its known exploited vulnerabilities catalog Wednesday.

The three-year gap between known initial attacks and detected exploitation of the zero-days showcases the attackers’ surgical use of vulnerabilities and the highly targeted nature of their campaign, said Ben Harris, founder and CEO of watchTowr.

The timeline and known attack path also indicates operational discipline that allowed attackers to maintain long-term access in critical network infrastructure without triggering alarms, McKee said. Those activities align “more closely with state-sponsored espionage tradecraft than financially motivated crime,” he added.

CISA’s emergency directive requires federal agencies to take inventory of all vulnerable Cisco SD-WAN systems, collect logs from those systems, apply Cisco’s security updates, hunt for evidence of compromise and follow Cisco’s guidance by Friday.

The latest campaign targeting Cisco network edge technology shares many similarities with another string of attacks officials and Cisco warned about in September. Those attacks, which involved at least two actively exploited zero-days, were underway for at least a year before they were first discovered in May.

Cisco did not answer questions about any potential connections between the campaigns. The vendor and officials have also thus far avoided sharing any details about what occurred behind the scenes during these sustained attacks.

A spokesperson for Cisco urged customers to upgrade software and follow guidance from its advisory.

Unfortunately, it’s too late for some Cisco SD-WAN customers to patch, Harris said. “Cisco’s advice to fully rebuild and look for prior signs of intrusion should be taken seriously.”

Vulnerabilities grew like weeds in 2025, but only 1% were weaponized in attacks

Would-be attackers spent 2025 swimming in a sea of more than 40,000 newly published vulnerabilities, VulnCheck said in a report released Wednesday, but only 1% of those defects, just 422, were exploited in the wild.

As the deluge of vulnerabilities grows every year, and CVSS ratings lose significance for vulnerability management prioritization, some defenders are turning to research on known exploited vulnerabilities to narrow their scope of work and place more emphasis on verified risks.

“The growth in CVE volume is ludicrous, not necessarily unfounded, but it’s large. Defenders don’t know what to pay attention to,” Caitlin Condon, vice president of security research at VulnCheck, told CyberScoop. “Prioritization is still a huge problem.”

Too many defenders and researchers are paying attention to defects and unsubstantiated exploit concepts that aren’t worth their time, Condon added. “The indicators of risk that used to be semi reliable, now no longer are.”

The technologies exploited by attackers are developed and sold by many repeat offenders. Some of the vendors on VulnCheck’s list of the most routinely targeted vulnerabilities enjoy large market shares.

Other vendors, especially those in network edge device space, have been inundated with malicious activity for years and remain the preferred intrusion point for all attacks.

Network edge devices were responsible for 191 of the 672 products impacted by new known exploited vulnerabilities last year, representing 28% of the top targeted technologies in 2025, according to VulnCheck.

“Anything that’s in that position of being at the network edge, guarding access to corporate networks, often in a privileged place for secure communication,” is naturally a large target, Condon said.

This problem is exacerbated by the fact many network devices are running on code bases that haven’t been radically changed in about a decade. Meanwhile, attackers have copies of that software and use fully automated analysis pipelines to quickly identify new vulnerabilities.

“Threat actors are much more organized presently than we all collectively are on defense,” Condon said. Defenders have to assume there’s going to be a new zero-day in any network edge device at any time, and patches will be reversed for exploit development in short order, she added.

Each of the top 50 vulnerabilities VulnCheck flagged in its report were exploited in the wild last year with at least 20 working public exploits, attacks originating from at least two state-sponsored or cybercrime threat groups. The top exploited vulnerabilities were also linked to least one ransomware variant and appeared in at least two instances of known botnet activity.

Four of the 10 most routinely targeted vulnerabilities last year — CVE-2025-53770 and CVE-2025-53771, which are variants of previously disclosed vulnerabilities CVE-2025-49706 and CVE-2025-49704 — were contained in Microsoft SharePoint. All four of the zero-day vulnerabilities were exploited en masse and initially compromised more than 400 organizations, including the Departments of Energy, Homeland Security and Health and Human Services.

VulnCheck confirmed a combined 69 known exploits for the quartet of SharePoint vulnerabilities. Researchers attributed the exploited vulnerabilities to a collective 29 threat groups and 18 ransomware variants, yet the attackers involved likely targeted more than one of the zero-days, resulting in some overlap.

Microsoft topped the list with nine of the 50 routinely targeted vulnerabilities appearing in its products last year. Ivanti was responsible for five, or 10% of the most targeted vulnerabilities last year. Fortinet ranked third on VulnCheck’s list with four vulnerabilities, followed by VMware with three, while SonicWall and Oracle each ranked high on the list with two exploited defects.

The most targeted vulnerability of 2025 belongs to React2Shell, a maximum-severity defect in React Server Components that racked up 236 valid public exploits before the end of the year, less than a month after it was publicly disclosed by Meta and React.

More than 200 of those public exploits were validated by VulnCheck by mid-December, as Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 confirmed more than 60 organizations were impacted by an initial wave of attacks.

VulnCheck’s research underscores that technology, ultimately in all of its forms, is the problem.

“We are at a point here where we’re not talking about a single vendor or technology. We are talking about writ large, we are getting creamed. We’ve got to start assessing ruthlessly and immediately how technology needs to evolve to be more resilient to these attacks over the long term,” Condon said.

“We need to start being much more realistic about the state of our tech and what that means for cybersecurity.”

Across party lines and industry, the verdict is the same: CISA is in trouble

“Pretty much fallen apart.”

“It’s really hard to find something positive to say right now.”

It’s been a little more than one year into the second Trump administration, and there’s a large consensus, if not total unanimity, among those who have worked with and for the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency: It has suffered significantly during that time.

CISA has lost roughly a third of its personnel and shuttered entire divisions. Observers across the political spectrum told CyberScoop for this story that even on its core missions, like coordinating with industry and protecting federal networks, the agency is significantly diminished.

Many sources that spoke with CyberScoop did so under the condition of anonymity, in order to be more candid or avoid retribution. They told CyberScoop that CISA’s biggest problems, and their consequences, include:

Trump’s ire over the 2020 election results has led to the agency being deprioritized within the administration. Congress has yet to approve the administration’s permanent pick to lead the agency, Sean Plankey, and lawmakers have failed to do other things to strengthen it.

CISA’s capabilities have been significantly diminished by the loss of personnel, expertise and programs.

In the absence of a permanent leader, Acting Director Madhu Gottumukkala has struggled to lead the agency. “I don’t think anybody would argue he’s doing a great job,” one industry source said.

Organizations that previously turned to CISA for help now seek alternatives, like industry alliances, outside consultants or government-to-government partnerships.

Where to assign blame varied from source to source. Most criticized both the administration and Congress, though some faulted one more than the other.

Some see bright sports in CISA under the current administration. And while many are  pessimistic about the agency’s future, others expressed optimism.

But the first year reviews are not glowing.

“Year one was a tough year for the agency,” said House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Andrew Garbarino, R-N.Y.  He noted that a “lot of the best and brightest have left the agency,” though he expressed optimism about Plankey’s ability to turn CISA around. “The amount of cyberattacks that our nation is seeing every day, both on the private side and on the federal government side — you want your best people there fighting against it, and if they’re somewhere else, it definitely leaves us all vulnerable.”

Said Mississippi Rep. Bennie Thompson, the top Democrat on Garbarino’s panel: “It’s tough to have a robust entity when you cut the money…we are weaker because of CISA’s lack of manpower.”

Trump has harbored animosity toward CISA since 2020, when it contradicted his false claims related to widespread electoral fraud. He and his allies built on that animosity, recommending in Project 2025 that the agency be dismantled, divided by its core responsibilities, and farmed out to other federal agencies.

“There was uniquely a target on its back,” said one CISA official who left in 2025. That hostility came from some Republicans in Congress, especially Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, who chairs the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.

Said Thompson: “CISA wasn’t politicized for the most part, until the Trump administration came along and accused them of somehow contributing to his [election] loss.”

CISA has lost substantial personnel, including veterans and whole teams. Some employees were transferred to other divisions in the Department of Homeland Security. Election security was quickly cut. Two information sharing and analysis centers (ISACs) that serve state and local governments lost funding. A division coordinating with foreign governments, businesses and state and local governments was effectively closed.

The agency has lost senior leaders in programs like counter-ransomware initiatives, threat hunting and secure software development. Contracts for things like detecting threats in critical infrastructure networks, tracking vulnerabilities and collaborating with industry teetered, albeit sometimes only temporarily.

DHS has unraveled multiple programs in which CISA plays a key role, such as by dismissing members of the Cyber Safety Review Board and disbanding the Critical Infrastructure Partnership Advisory Council. Congress has lurched between letting both a key state and local cyber grant program and a cyber threat information sharing law lapse and temporarily re-upping them.

The departures and program changes likely haven’t ended, either.

“It’s not a very harmonious place right now,” said one industry source. “I hear from people that are looking to leave.” Former CISA employees say those who remain either believe strongly in the mission, or are simply keeping their heads down until retirement from federal service.

“People I talk to say the morale is really low,” said James Lewis, distinguished fellow with the tech policy program at the Center for European Policy Analysis think tank.

CISA and DHS officials routinely say the changes are designed to get the agency “back on mission.” Lewis, industry officials and others say CISA probably never needed to get involved in combatting misinformation and disinformation, roles that rankled some conservatives, but the agency largely halted that work prior to Trump returning to office.

Some saw duplication and redundancy at CISA as legitimate problems. “I did see overlap between who was actually doing policy and who was actually doing the operational work,” said Ari Schwartz, managing director of cybersecurity services at the law firm Venable and a former Obama administration cybersecurity official.

It was not that long ago when CISA experienced quick budget growth, particularly after its establishment in 2018.

“As with any organization, the first few years are growth years and after a while, the agency needed to reevaluate how it was operating and meeting its statutory authorities,” said Kate DiEmidio, who formerly served as the agency’s director of legislative affairs and acting chief external affairs officer. “There was a need for the agency to refocus.”

Even among those who saw the need for change at CISA, though, many saw the Trump administration as going way too far. “CISA needed surgery,” Lewis said, but “what it needed was surgery with a scalpel, not a sledgehammer.” He added, “Not only is the White House hostile to CISA, but cybersecurity isn’t a priority for them.”

The cuts have created real-world consequences for cybersecurity coordination. Former officials and industry partners describe broken relationships, unanswered requests for help and serious questions about whether CISA can handle a major crisis. The coordination and engagement that defined the agency’s approach have largely diminished.

The end result is that “they’ve dismantled all of those capabilities in units within government,” said Caitlin Durkovich, a former DHS official in the Obama administration and White House official in the Biden administration. She recently started a firm with former top CISA official Jeff Greene that offers services CISA has scaled back, such as security assessments.

“It’s been really hard to watch,” Greene said, how CISA has been working with the private sector and local governments on “developing a level of trust that is weakening or gone.”

One industry source said they used to meet regularly with top officials, but now can’t get a response. “We’ve got really good engagement elsewhere in government. We really would like the opportunity to do the same thing with CISA,” they said. ““Some of the trust that had been built up has been eroded.”

Thompson said the biggest losses have been in election security and secure-by-design, areas where his staff says personnel has been “decimated.”

Said another industry source: “I do feel like that when people, if organizations, want to reach out to CISA, it’s not clear who’s there… If we got into a major conflict, let’s say, with China, and they start triggering Volt Typhoon-related malware, are we organized and ready to roll? I don’t think so.”

Another former CISA official described the current situation as a “lack of capacity,” especially when it comes to coordinating with state and local governments and others on a regional basis.

“A bunch of regions are really grappling with the loss of really key personnel who were the ones that were establishing and maintaining these relationships, and really trying to build the trust between the agency and the private sector, and especially in critical infrastructure,” they said. “Not having as many people to help do that national coordinating function that CISA is supposed to do is a real issue.”

They also said there are fewer people working in “flagship programs” like secure-by-design and developing regulations for the landmark Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act of 2022 (CIRCIA). “People are overstretched,” they said. “They’re not doing all the things that they could or should be doing, or want to be doing, and I think that you see evidence of that with talk from the private sector and their inability to to reach people and to get help “

Schwartz said he worries about when “an incident happens, do they have the people to go in, go to the states, go locally, and really do the work that’s needed, as they did in the past? Because they’ve lost some of that ability.”

Lewis said that “overall, the impression is it’s a much weaker entity than it was a year ago.”

“Their power was in their ability to act as a focal point, to coordinate, to bring people together, and just the publication of vulnerabilities and some of the things they were starting to get into in the previous administration were big steps forward that’s been diminished because they don’t have the people now,” he said. “So a smaller organization, that’s just not going to be as powerful.”

State and local governments say they’ve lost critical connections with CISA, saying they’ve had to turn to one another to fill the gaps.

“We’re asking states to do a job they’re not resourced to do, while weakening the one federal agency designed to help them,” said Errol Weiss, chief security officer at the Health-ISAC. “This is precisely where you do need a strong, centralized federal security function. We already have a national shortage of cybersecurity experts, and you can’t just replicate that expertise 50 times over.”

Overall, Weiss said industry partners have felt the lack of outreach from the agency.  “Fewer touchpoints, fewer briefings, fewer problem‑solving calls,” he told CyberScoop, adding that there’s “a growing perception that CISA is being hollowed out where it matters most to industry: stakeholder engagement, collaborative forums, and operational support during incidents.”

Rob Knake, a former top Biden administration official, recently said that “CISA as an organization has pretty much fallen apart.”

One near-universal sentiment is that as Sean Plankey’s leadership nomination drags in the Senate, the agency is worse off.

“We need to start this year off right, and we’re already in February and can’t get Plankey confirmed,” Garbarino said. “There’s nothing better than having a Senate-confirmed person running the show.”

The acting director has also faced criticism beyond the operational issues.  Gottumukkala, who served as South Dakota’s chief information officer under Kristi Noem before she became DHS secretary, has faced fire from both parties for his stewardship.

A string of embarrassing stories have emerged about Gottumukkala, from the tale of him failing a polygraph test and seeking to oust those who administered it; to his reported attempted ouster of veteran agency CIO Robert Costello; to his reported uploading of sensitive contract data to ChatGPT. DHS has defended Gottumukkala amid those revelations.

Reading stories like that, “It just sounds like amateur hour,” said one former CISA employee.

“I don’t think he’s up to the task. I believe that he’s not the best person, and I think he is just somebody the secretary likes, because they both are from South Dakota.” Thompson said. “I don’t know anybody before this administration who would be in sensitive areas and not have passed minimal standards like the polygraph.”

The ChatGPT story drew concern from the right by Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, as well as from conservative figure Laura Loomer (the latter of whose remarks were racially tinged). Others were more perturbed by the lie detector story.

“When you have security issues with someone in a leadership position, you should find another place for them to go,” said a former Trump administration national security official. “There are plenty of competent people in DHS, in CISA, who could hold things together until Sean Plankey gets there. There are lots of serious things CISA needs to be working on right now. This is a drag on that. It’s not a place where you want any type of friction at the top.”

Garbarino was more generous, noting Gottumukkala’s technical background. DiEmidio also noted Gottumukkala’s technical skills. But Garbarino and Nevada Rep. Mark Amodei, the GOP chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security, have been seeking CISA’s organizational plans to no avail.

“I don’t think he’s intentionally lying to us by saying there’s no reorg plan,” Garbarino said. “But there’s got to be some reasoning behind all these moves, moving the people around, or layoffs or whatever. I want to give him the benefit of the doubt that he is the technical guy that has been given a non-technical job to do.”

Schwartz and some others largely blame Congress for CISA’s current woes, since they haven’t approved Plankey as a full-time, permanent leader. “A lot of the issue is the fact that just doesn’t have the leadership to be able to participate in senior-level discussions,” he said.

Despite myriad complaints, many observers still see value in the current iteration of CISA. Some are hopeful about its ability to rebound, too.

CISA says it’s still devoted to its missions. The agency published a 2025 year-in-review about its accomplishments.

“CISA remains steadfast in its mission to safeguard the systems Americans rely on by strengthening federal network defenses, empowering businesses, and fortifying critical infrastructure nationwide,” Gottumukkala said in a statement to CyberScoop.

Moving forward, “we will deepen collaboration with trusted partners, prioritize highly skilled technical professionals, and direct resources for maximum impact—accelerating innovation, operational coordination, and workforce right-sizing to reduce long-term risks while maintaining strong industry partnerships and cost efficiency,” he said. “The CISA leadership and workforce remains committed to this mission despite a small minority who are upset that accountability and reform have come to the agency.”

It’s a message Gottumukkala recently delivered to Congress. “He tried to give the impression that we haven’t lost any capacity,” Thompson said. “I wasn’t impressed.”

Others said CISA is still carrying out many of its old tasks, such as issuing public alerts on vulnerabilities and threats.

“There’s still some good reporting coming out,” Greene said. “But what I can’t know is the volume of what they can put out versus what they used to be able to put out.”

Weiss said “CISA still has tremendous value in areas only the federal government can truly provide: national‑level visibility, cross‑sector coordination and the ability to marshal resources across agencies in a crisis.” But it’s not clear whether CISA can rise to the occasion like it did during the 2024 Change Healthcare crisis.

“All of this means it’s more important than ever for the private sector to take the initiative,” he said. “Critical infrastructure owners and operators cannot assume the federal government will have the capacity to step in the way it once did.”

Weiss and others also said that CISA has refocused on federal networks, but others, such as Lewis, said it’s also diminished there. “That’s their primary mission, and they don’t have the policies or the bodies to do that,” Lewis said.

Garbarino and a number of industry sources say they’re encouraged by the idea that the Trump administration could write less onerous regulations for CIRCIA, with an earlier draft drawing bipartisan and industry criticism.

A Senate-confirmed leader could further brighten the agency’s prospects, many agree. “They still have some good talent there. It’s not totally that we’ve lost everything there,” Schwartz said. “If you have leadership in there, then you can build it up.”

DiEmidio said some of the staff changes have made sense. Election security had more people than other sectors that needed the help, she said.

“In some ways, I think the external attention to CISA’s mission in the media and with Congress was completely focused on one or two things, and the focus on the things that really matter, and the good work that CISA is doing got overshadowed,” she said. For the agency’s cybersecurity division and other cyber teams, “there were several incidents over the summer where those teams were incredible. They were working evenings, weekends.”

But many agree that rebuilding CISA’s workforce will be difficult.

The Trump administration has deliberately made working for the federal government challenging as a matter of policy. Russell Vought, head of the Office of Management and Budget, said before the election that the goal was to put federal workers “in trauma.” Morale at CISA has been particularly bad, they say. Periodic DHS shutdowns haven’t helped.

On the plus side for CISA, it’s a bad labor market, Lewis said.

Some of what CISA needs to do going forward is about managing expectations, said DiEmidio.

“What I would want to make sure is that CISA has a hiring plan in place to start hiring, especially in those key technical positions at all levels,” she said. “ I think you have to have an understanding that people are going to rotate in and out of government. Not everyone wants to stay in government long term and that’s okay.”

But there are some worries about CISA recruiting going forward. “Just the way they handle the departures, for a lot of folks, I don’t think it gives a lot of encouragement to individuals that ‘Hey, this is a great place to work,’” said one former DHS official.

Chinese group’s ChatGPT use reveals worldwide harassment campaign against critics

A Chinese law enforcement official attempted to use ChatGPT to review its reports on cyber operations, subsequently revealing details of a worldwide online harassment and silencing campaign of China’s critics at home and abroad.

In a new threat report released Wednesday, OpenAI said the activity concerned a single account that regularly used ChatGPT to review and edit reports on “cyber special operations.” That same account also attempted to use ChatGPT to plan a propaganda campaign against Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi. When the model refused, the actor came back weeks later with prompts indicating the operation had proceeded anyway.

The reports uploaded to ChatGPT “suggested that the threat actors had conducted many other, earlier operations, in a comprehensive effort to suppress dissent and silence critics both online and offline, at home and abroad,” the report said.

While there’s only evidence of a single account used by the agency, OpenAI said the operations targeting Chinese critics described in the report appears “large-scale, resource-intensive and sustained,” consisting of hundreds of human staff, thousands of fake accounts across different social media platforms and the use of local Chinese AI models.

These operations included mass posting and content generation, flooding social media companies with bogus complaints about accounts owned by dissidents, forging documents and in some cases even impersonating U.S. officials for intimidation.

A separate campaign involving a cluster of accounts that “likely originated” in mainland China prompted ChatGPT for information on “U.S. persons, forums and federal building locations.”

The accounts also generated email drafts purportedly from a company called Nimbus Hub Consulting based in Hong Kong, but OpenAI’s report notes that the accounts used VPNs and prompted the model using Simplified Chinese language characters, which is more commonly associated with mainland China.

OpenAI said that, when asked about U.S. entities, ChatGPT also provided “publicly-available” information sources on U.S. federal government office locations, the distribution of federal employees by state, professional forums and job websites in the US economics and finance industries.

The Chinese actors generated English-language emails to U.S. state officials and to business and financial policy analysts, inviting them to join paid consultations and offer strategic advice to the actors’ clients.

These emails would frequently seek to move the conversation to another video conferencing platform, such as WhatsApp, Zoom or Teams. One of the accounts uploaded their hardware specifications and asked for step-by-step, non-technical instructions for installing real-time face-swapping software called FaceFusion.

“The model responded with information that was drawn from FaceFusion’s publicly-available website and documentation,” OpenAI said.

The report focused mainly on how cybercriminals and state actors used ChatGPT to support scams and influence operations. OpenAI detailed four covert information operations and three romance-scam operations. In addition to Chinese influence operations, it also reported on propaganda content generated for Rybar, a Russia-aligned online influence group.

OpenAI’s report details how some operators used ChatGPT to automate isolated tasks, like a Cambodian romance scam that blended human and AI operators when communicating with victims. The report did not cite any instances of threat actors using ChatGPT for direct offensive hacking operations.

AI tools can give both malicious and legitimate actors access to tremendous speed and scale online.  Over the past year, Chinese hackers have reportedly used at least one other U.S.-made AI model to conduct heavily automated cyberattacks against businesses and governments.During a media Q&A, an OpenAI official said they were not aware of any cases in which threat actors used ChatGPT to carry out automated attacks, but added that the company has multiple ongoing investigations that have not concluded.

Much of the observed activity in OpenAI’s report follows a common pattern, detailing threat actors who are still very much in the throes of experimenting with AI technology and learning where it provides the most value in their chain of operations.

Some used it to generate propaganda content around a specific target, or monitor social media platforms, or provide better language translation for phishing lures. But similar to reporting from Google earlier this month, in most cases threat actors are using AI in limited and targeted ways as an amplifier to existing operations.

In some cases, it’s clear that ChatGPT is one of multiple AI tools being used by the threat actor. In the case of the Chinese law enforcement agency, the status reports uploaded to the model on information operations reference the use of locally deployed Chinese AI models like DeepSeek, and it’s likely the group used a different model to prepare for its propaganda campaign against Taikaichi.

“Threat activity is seldom limited to one platform; as our report…shows, it is not always limited to one AI model,” the report said. “Rather, threat actors may use different AI models at various points in their operational workflow.”

Ex-L3Harris executive sentenced to 87 months in prison for selling zero-day exploits to Russian broker

An ex-L3 Harris executive was sentenced to over seven years in prison Tuesday after pleading guilty to selling eight zero-day exploits to a Russian broker in exchange for millions of dollars.

Peter Williams, 39, admitted to two counts of theft of trade secrets in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., last year, acknowledging he took at least eight exploits or exploit components while working at Trenchant, a specialized cybersecurity unit owned by L3Harris. Prosecutors said the materials were intended for restricted use by the U.S. government and allied partners.

Authorities said Williams sold the stolen information to a broker that advertised itself as a reseller of hacking tools and described it as serving multiple customers, including the Russian government. In court, the government referred to the buyer as “Company 3,” but details read aloud during the plea hearing pointed to Operation Zero, a Russian exploit broker that publicly markets itself online as a platform for purchasing zero-day vulnerabilities.

Additionally, Operation Zero was one of two zero-day brokerages sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury in a separate announcement made Tuesday.

Prosecutors said Williams used his access at Trenchant over roughly three years to obtain proprietary materials and entered into several deals with the broker, receiving payments in cryptocurrency. Officials said he used proceeds to buy luxury items. The Justice Department has estimated the theft caused $35 million in losses to the contractor, while prosecutors said Williams earned $1.3 million tied to the sales and should be ordered to pay that amount in restitution.

Williams’ background added another layer noted in court. Prosecutors said he previously served in the Australian Signals Directorate, Australia’s foreign signals intelligence agency. Trenchant’s origins are also part of the record: it was formed after L3Harris acquired Azimuth Security and Linchpin Labs, Australian firms associated with exploit development.

Neither Trenchant nor L3Harris is accused of wrongdoing in the criminal case.

A hearing for further restitution related to the $35 million in losses is scheduled for May.

Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters auditioning female voices to sharpen social engineering

Telegram posts promise up to $1,000 per call as gang refines IT helpdesk ruse

Prolific cybercrime crew Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters (SLSH) is reportedly recruiting women in the hope of improving its social engineering success.

According to Telegram channel posts made on February 22, gathered by Dataminr, the group behind last year's Salesloft Drift attacks promised payments between $500-$1,000 per call, depending on "success and hit rate."

Interested applicants are invited to apply by sending a message to the group's "Support" account. They will be asked a series of questions before being accepted, the group said, and those who pass the test will be given a script to work from.

SLSH is known for effective social engineering. Experts who have listened in on calls carried out by Scattered Spider, one of the groups that form the cybercrime triad, previously confirmed that its tactics are sophisticated and highly effective.

The Telegram ads suggest that SLSH is looking for people to socially engineer IT helpdesk staff. This aligns with the group's typical MO of deceiving IT helpdesks into handing over credentials that attackers can use to gain access to an organization's network.

"This recruitment drive represents a calculated evolution in SLH's tactics," said Jeanette Miller-Osborn, field cyber intelligence officer at Dataminr.

"By specifically seeking female voices, the group likely aims to bypass the 'traditional' profiles of attackers that IT helpdesk staff may be trained to identify, thereby increasing the effectiveness of their impersonation efforts."

Miller-Osborn recommends that organizations make their helpdesks aware of these shifting tactics and ensure identities are thoroughly verified, either through video calls or secondary internal verification.

SLSH's recruitment drive is the latest in what appears to be a trend of crowdsourcing efforts.

Back in October, and again via Telegram, the group said it would pay anyone $10 in Bitcoin to "endlessly harass" executives at organizations it was trying to extort.

"You have permission to endlessly harass these executives till they comply with us," its message stated. "When we tell you stop emailing a company or number of executives emails, you are to stop emailing them. This will be centralized and well operated."

When The Register asked SLSH about how many people had taken up its offer after the first few days, it claimed it had "practically paid out over $1,000 at this point," though these claims cannot be independently verified. ®

Google catches Beijing spies using Sheets to spread espionage across 4 continents

UNC2814 historically targets governments and telcos

A China-linked crew found a unique formula for attacking telcos and government orgs across the Americas, Asia, and Africa in its latest round of intrusions. Google's threat intelligence, along with unnamed industry partners, disrupted the gang, which used the Chocolate Factory's own spreadsheet tools as part of its exploits.

The Chocolate Factory announced the Google Threat Intelligence Group-led actions on Wednesday and said that, in partnership with other teams, it terminated all Google Cloud Projects that had been controlled by UNC2814, a group that GTIG has tracked since 2017. They also disabled all known UNC2814 infrastructure and accounts, and revoked access to the Google Sheets API calls used by the Chinese snoops for command-and-control (C2) purposes.

"As of Feb. 18, GTIG's investigation confirmed that UNC2814 has impacted 53 victims in 42 countries across four continents, and identified suspected infections in at least 20 more countries," the threat hunters said in the report.

They also noted that UNC2814 has no observed overlap with Salt Typhoon, another Beijing-backed group that hacked America's major telecommunications firms and stole information belonging to nearly every American beginning as far back as 2019.

The Googlers don't know how UNC2814 gained initial access to victims' environments for this particular campaign, but said the suspected Chinese government goon squad historically breaks in by exploiting and compromising web servers and edge systems.

"We don't have visibility into the specific targeting, but previous PRC-nexus espionage intrusions against telecoms have targeted individuals and organizations for surveillance efforts, particularly dissidents and activists, as well as traditional espionage targets," GTIG tech lead Dan Perez told The Register. "The kind of access UNC2814 achieved during this campaign would likely enable this kind of operation."

Perez declined to name the specific industry partners that GTIG worked with to take down the threat group's infrastructure.

The security sleuths uncovered this campaign during a Mandiant investigation into suspicious activity in a customer's environment. Specifically, this binary, "/var/tmp/xapt," initiated a shell with root privileges, and then executed a command to retrieve the system’s user and group identifiers to confirm it had successfully escalated to root.

Google suspects the payload was named xapt, after the command-line tool in Debian and Ubuntu systems, to make it easier to hide in the victim's environment and look like a legitimate tool.

The intruders also used a novel backdoor, Gridtide, that abuses legitimate Google Sheets API functionality to disguise its command-and-control (C2) traffic. Mandiant has linked Gridtide to UNC2814.

After breaking in, the spies moved laterally via SSH, performed reconnaissance, escalated privileges, and then deployed the Gridtide backdoor using a command, "nohup ./xapt," that allows it to run even after the user closes the session.

"Subsequently, SoftEther VPN Bridge was deployed to establish an outbound encrypted connection to an external IP address," the threat intel team wrote. "VPN configuration metadata suggests UNC2814 has been leveraging this specific infrastructure since July 2018."

The C-based backdoor uses Google Sheets as its C2 platform, can execute shell commands, and can upload and download files. In this case, the attacker deployed Gridtide on an endpoint containing personal information - likely to identify and track persons of interest - including full name, phone number, date and place of birth, voter ID and national ID numbers.

While Google's responders didn't observe any actual data theft, previous Chinese government espionage campaigns have involved stealing call data records and unencrypted SMS messages, and abusing telecoms' legal wiretapping systems.

GTIG says it has notified all victims of this campaign, and is "actively supporting" those who have been compromised. ®

Ex-L3Harris exec jailed 7 years for selling exploits to Russia

Former Trenchant manager profited millions from cyber tools reserved for the US

The former general manager of L3Harris's cyber arm will spend the next seven years behind bars for selling trade secrets to Russia.

Peter Williams, 39, was sentenced to 87 months in prison this week after pleading guilty in October to selling cyber tools while in a senior position at Trenchant, a subdivision of L3Harris and a major US defense contractor.

The Australian admitted to stealing eight exploits over a three-year period that should have been provided exclusively to the US and selling them to a Russian bidder.

He said he sold the exploits to a Russian broker "via encrypted means" in exchange for cryptocurrency, which he then used to buy luxury items such as jewelry, properties, and vacations.

Williams acknowledged that his actions led to a $35 million loss to the US and its geopolitical allies, and harmed the intelligence communities of the US and his native Australia.

US Attorney Jeanine Pirro said Williams sold the exploits for up to $4 million in cryptocurrency. A restitution hearing is scheduled for May 12, but his prison sentence also came with an order to forfeit $1.3 million in cash, as well as the crypto, properties, and luxury items purchased using the Russian broker's money.

"Peter Williams stole a US defense contractor's trade secrets about highly sensitive cyber capabilities and sold them to a broker whose clients include the Russian government, putting our national security and countless potential victims at risk," said Roman Rozhavsky, assistant director of the FBI's Counterintelligence and Espionage Division.

"The FBI and our partners remain unwavering in our commitment to protecting America's critical technologies, and we will ensure any who attempt to profit at our nation's expense face the full weight of the criminal justice system.

"Let this be a clear warning to all who consider placing greed over country: if you betray your position of trust and sell sensitive American technology to our foreign adversaries, the FBI will not rest until you're brought to justice."

The Register contacted Williams' legal representatives and L3Harris. The company declined to comment.

Russian exploit broker sanctioned

On the same day Williams' sentence was announced, the US sanctioned Russian exploit broker Sergey Sergeyevich Zelenyuk, his company Operation Zero, and five other individuals and entities for acquiring US cyber tools.

The Treasury confirmed that St Petersburg-based Operation Zero was the recipient of the eight exploits Williams sold, and the company then sold these on to at least one unauthorized user.

Operation Zero had been actively paying for exploits since 2021, a year before Williams started selling to it in 2022. The Treasury stated that the company had offered millions of dollars for exploits, focusing on popular US software and encrypted messaging platforms, which could be used for ransomware and other forms of attack.

Zelenyuk and his company had openly stated that they would only sell exploits to non-NATO countries and had made efforts to develop their own products, such as spyware and ways of exfiltrating personal data from AI products.

Also sanctioned is United Arab Emirates-based Special Technology Services LLC FZ (STS), another of Zelenyuk's companies, which the US believes was established to carry out similar business in Asia and the Middle East.

Other individuals sanctioned include Marina Evgenyevna Vasanovich, Zelenyuk's assistant, Azizjon Makhmudovich Mamashoyev, and Oleg Vyacheslavovich Kucherov.

Both Mamashoyev and Kucherov are suspected of having business dealings with Operation Zero. Kucherov is a suspected member of the Trickbot gang. Mamashoyev's company, Advance Security Solutions, an alleged exploit broker based in the UAE and Uzbekistan, was also sanctioned.

The actions taken by the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) this week are the first made under the Protecting American Intellectual Property Act (PAIPA), which became law in 2023.

"If you steal US trade secrets, we will hold you accountable," said Scott Bessent, Secretary of the Treasury. "Treasury will continue to work alongside the rest of the Trump administration to protect sensitive American intellectual property and safeguard our national security." ®

Wynn Resorts takes attacker's word for it that stolen staff data was deleted

Security pros question assurances as company offers staff credit monitoring

Wynn Resorts has confirmed that employee data was stolen from its servers, and is taking the hackers' word that they've since deleted it.

For anyone familiar with how extortion typically plays out, that's a bold leap of faith. However, Wynn appears satisfied enough to include the assurance in its first official statement since prolific cybercrime crew ShinyHunters claimed credit for the attack last week.

"We have learned that an unauthorized third party acquired certain employee data," a Wynn Resorts spokesperson told The Register. "Upon discovery, we immediately activated our incident response protocols and launched a thorough investigation with the help of external cybersecurity experts.

"The unauthorized third party has stated that the stolen data has been deleted. We are monitoring and to date have not seen any evidence that the data has been published or otherwise misused."

As noted by Dray Agha, senior manager of security operations at Huntress, when miscreants "confirm" they have deleted stolen data, it suggests a ransom may have been paid, although Wynn declined to comment.

"Trusting cybercriminals is inherently flawed; there is no honour among thieves," Agha told The Register. "There is absolutely no reliable way to verify that an extortionist has permanently deleted stolen data. Copies are frequently retained, shared, or sold months down the line."

He added: "An attacker providing an assurance of deletion is a classic hallmark of a completed extortion negotiation. In the business model of modern cybercrime, 'deletion' is exactly the service these cartels claim to provide once their financial demands have been met."

Wynn Resorts, which runs a line of luxury hotels across the world, told us the attack had no impact on its operations or guest stays.

It's also offering free credit monitoring and identity protection to all employees, and in typical post-breach verbiage assured that data security "is our top priority."

Agha said that Wynn's decision to offer credit monitoring to employees shows how little anyone can trust the word of a cybercriminal.

"Wynn's decision to offer credit monitoring to employees is a necessary and prudent move, as it acknowledges that a threat actor's 'promise' holds zero actual security value," he said. "We cannot definitively confirm a ransom was paid without explicit confirmation from Wynn."

Regular readers may recall the LockBit leaks of 2024, and how the UK's National Crime Agency (NCA) attempted to undermine the reputation of the ransomware operation at the time.

ShinyHunters claims it drove off with 1.7M CarGurus records

In turning the gang's leak site against it, exposing its inner secrets, the NCA confirmed a long-held suspicion among security practitioners that cybercriminals don't delete data even after a ransom is paid.

"While no company can ever eliminate the risk of a cyberattack, we are taking appropriate steps and working with industry-leading third-party IT advisors to strengthen our systems to protect against future incidents," Wynn's statement concluded.

ShinyHunters claimed the attack against Wynn on February 20. As we reported at the time, a sample of the stolen data shared with The Register appeared legitimate and included full names, email addresses, phone numbers, job roles, salaries, start dates, dates of birth, and other personal information belonging to staff members.

The cybercrooks claimed to have breached Wynn as far back as September 2025 by exploiting an Oracle PeopleSoft vulnerability and using a staffer's credentials.

ShinyHunters is separate from but loosely affiliated with Scattered Spider, which was responsible for a cyber double whammy on Las Vegas hotels and casinos in 2024.

Several Scattered Spider members were arrested in connection with the attacks on Caesars Entertainment and MGM Resorts – some in 2024, and some over a year after the attacks. ®

OpenAI says Chinese cops used ChatGPT to plan and track smear ops against opponents

Note to secret agents: ChatGPT is NOT a private diary

A ChatGPT user with links to Chinese law enforcement tried to use the AI chatbot to run smear campaigns targeting the Japanese prime minister and other critics of the Chinese Communist Party, according to OpenAI's latest report on malicious uses of its models.

The user, since banned by the AI giant, tried to convince the model to help them plan a smear campaign against Sanae Takaichi, Japan's first female prime minister, after she criticized the Chinese Communist Party for trampling human rights in Inner Mongolia.

These are basically covert influence operations and transnational repression

This occurred in mid-October, we're told. Some of the prompts included asking the model to post and amplify negative comments about her on social media, and use fake email accounts purporting to be foreign residents to send complaints about Takaichi to other Japanese politicians.

When ChatGPT refused, the user seemingly used other companies' models to carry out the campaign. Later that month, however, the same user asked ChatGPT to edit status reports on what they called "cyber special operations."

"Despite the name, these are basically operations designed to harass and silence domestic and foreign critics, closer to what we'd think of as covert influence operations and transnational repression," Ben Nimmo, principal investigator on OpenAI's Intelligence and Investigations team, said on a call with reporters.

The malicious activity OpenAI spotted included generating status reports on operations targeting Chinese dissidents and CCP critics, along with the specific covert op against Takaichi. The latter seemed to follow the structure of the original draft plan to discredit the Japanese politician, focusing on the same five areas – negative comments, immigration, living conditions, far-right links, and tariffs – and even provided the threat intel team with several operational details about the smear campaign.

The status reports claimed the operation asked unnamed Japanese influencers for support, and launched a set of hashtags, including #右翼 共生者 (this means "right-wing symbiont"). OpenAI says it found evidence of this hashtag spreading - but in "small quantities" - across X, Japanese online community Pixiv, and Blogspot beginning in late October 2025.

None of the posts containing the hashtag alongside Takaichi memes gained much traction. The YouTube videos had single-digit views, while Xeets and Pixiv posts typically showed zero engagements. One meme posted to Pixiv scored 108 views, the biggest audience for this hashtag.

From social media to psychological pressure

The same user's broader activity across a wide range of "cyber special operations" moved beyond posting on social media and into exerting social and psychological pressure to silence critics. The attacker’s tactics included targeting dissidents' mental health and their families, hacking their livestreams, and reporting their social media accounts for phony violations, sometimes supported by fake evidence.

In one such incident documented in the ChatGPT user's diary of cyber ops, they created a fake obituary and gravestone photos claiming that dissident Jie Lijian had died before mass posting these messages online.

Another report detailed efforts to get activist Hui Bo (@huikezhen) removed from X by filing thousands of reports against his Xeets and creating dozens of fake accounts using his likeness.

"While we are not able to independently confirm whether and how any such abusive reports were actually sent, as of November 29, 2025, Hui's X account was indeed restricted, and a number of other X accounts that used his name and profile picture showed up in search results instead," OpenAI’s report notes.

OpenAI putting bandaids on bandaids as prompt injection problems keep festering

ChatGPT used for evil: Fake IT worker resumes, misinfo, and cyber-op assist

How AI could eat itself: Competitors can probe models to steal their secrets and clone them

One another occasion, the same user reported that public security services targeted multiple dissidents because of a single campaign in which operators created a series of fake claims accusing three dissidents of a sex scandal. Online searches for the three names together produced "multiple" pieces of content that mirrored this claim across various blogs, Reddit, YouTube, Tumblr, Adobe’s community for creators Behance, and other websites.

"This is what Chinese, modern, transnational repression looks like," Nimmo said. "It's not just digital. It's not just about trolling. It's about trying to hit critics of the CCP with everything everywhere, all at once."

These cyber operations are "well -esourced" and "meticulously planned," he added. "They target people who dare to criticize the CCP's record, not just at home, but anywhere in the world."

This activity echoes earlier China-based influence ops campaigns dubbed "Spamouflage" by research teams. That the user's ChatGPT inputs included hashtags and references to fake social media accounts indicate "much wider cross-internet activity," the report says.

Meta, in its August 2023 threat report [PDF], attributed Spamouflage to individuals connected to Chinese law enforcement. ®

[47] TechCrunch Security - US cybersecurity agency CISA reportedly in dire shape amid Trump cuts and layoffs

[TAM METİN - 660 kelime]
U.S. cybersecurity agency CISA is reportedly in dire shape, according to bipartisan lawmakers and industry leaders who fear that the agency’s ability to perform its core mission has been diminished and left it unprepared for a cybersecurity crisis.

News site Cyberscoop’s Tim Starks spoke with sources across Congress, the private cyber industry, and beyond, and what came back reflected a general consensus that CISA has suffered under cuts and layoffs during the Trump administration’s first year.

Over that time, CISA has lost around one-third of its staff, which cost it programs, personnel, and expertise, including the agency’s counter-ransomware initiative and efforts to promote secure software development. Some of these have included several members of its election security team, TechCrunch reported last year. CISA is the federal agency responsible for election security. Some warned that Trump’s ongoing obsession with promoting false claims about the 2020 election has led to the administration deprioritizing CISA.

CISA also reassigned hundreds of other staffers to aid other agencies within the Department of Homeland Security as part of the Trump administration’s broad immigration crackdown.

Many of Cyberscoop’s sources blame the Trump administration, Congress, or both. Others singled out CISA’s acting director, Madhu Gottumukkala, as having struggled to lead the agency and reportedly caused security headaches as a result.

CISA has been without a permanent director since Trump entered office in 2025.

The cybersecurity agency is said to be currently operating at around 38% staff levels as the partial U.S. federal government shutdown, which began on February 14, drags on. Lawmakers have declined to continue funding federal immigration authorities amid widespread criticism following the killing of two U.S. citizens by federal agents.

[48] TechCrunch Security - Inside the story of the US defense contractor who leaked hacking tools to Russia
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[TAM METİN - 1762 kelime]
A veteran cybersecurity executive who prosecutors said “betrayed” the United States will spend at least the next seven years behind bars, after pleading guilty to stealing and selling hacking and surveillance tools to a Russian firm.

Peter Williams, a former executive at U.S. defense contractor L3Harris, was sentenced on Tuesday to 87 months in prison for leaking his former company’s trade secrets in exchange for $1.3 million in crypto between 2022 and 2025. Williams sold the exploits to Operation Zero, which the U.S. government calls “one of the world’s most nefarious exploit brokers.”

The successful conviction of Williams follows one of the most high-profile leaks of sensitive Western-made hacking tools in recent years. Even now that the case is over, there are still unanswered questions.

Williams, a 39-year-old Australian citizen who resided in Washington, D.C., was the general manager of Trenchant, the division of L3Harris that develops hacking and surveillance tools for the U.S. government and its closest global intelligence partners. Prosecutors say Williams took advantage of having “full access” to the company’s secure networks to download the hacking tools onto a portable hard drive, and later to his computer. Williams contacted Operation Zero under a pseudonym though, so it’s unclear if Operation Zero ever knew Williams’ real identity.

Trenchant is a crew of hackers and bug hunters who dig deep into other popular software made by companies like Google and Apple, identify flaws in those millions of lines of code, then devise techniques to turn those flaws into workable exploits that can be used to reliably hack into those products. These tools are typically called zero-day exploits because they take advantage of software flaws unknown to its developer, which can be worth millions of dollars.

The U.S. Department of Justice alleged that the hacking tools Williams sold could have allowed whoever used them to “potentially access millions of computers and devices around the world.”

For the past few months, I have been talking to sources and reporting on Williams’ story before news broke that he had been arrested. But what I had heard was patchwork and at times conflicting. I had heard someone had been arrested, but given the secret nature of the work involved in exploit development, proving it would be challenging.

When I first heard of Williams, I wasn’t clear that I had even gotten his name right. At that point, his story was a rumor, moving through the hush-hush grapevine of zero-day exploit developers, sellers, and people with ties to the intelligence community.

I heard that maybe he was called John, or perhaps Duggan? Or all the different ways you can spell that in English.

Some of the first rumors I heard were contradictory. Apparently he stole zero-days from Trenchant, and maybe he sold them to Russia, or perhaps another enemy of the United States and its allies, like North Korea or China?

It took weeks just to confirm that there was indeed someone who even fit that description. (It turned out that Williams’ middle name is John, and Doogie is his nickname in hacker circles.)

Then, as the weeks of reporting rolled on, things started to become much clearer.

The Russian connection

As I first revealed in October, Trenchant fired an employee after Williams, who was still at the time head of Trenchant, accused the employee of stealing and leaking Chrome zero-days. The story was even more intriguing because the employee told me that after he was fired, Apple notified him that someone had targeted his personal iPhone.

What I learned was just the tip of the iceberg. I had heard more from my sources, but we were still piecing parts of the story together.

Soon after, prosecutors made their first formal accusation against a man named Peter Williams for stealing trade secrets, which first surfaced in the U.S. public court system. In that first court document, prosecutors confirmed that the buyer of these trade secrets was a buyer in Russia.

However, there was no explicit reference to L3Harris nor Trenchant, nor the fact that the trade secrets that Williams stole were zero-days. Crucially, we still couldn’t confirm for certain that it was the same Peter Williams, who we thought would have access to highly sensitive exploits as Trenchant’s boss, and not some terrible case of mistaken identity.

We still weren’t there.

On a hunch and with nothing to lose, we contacted the Department of Justice to ask if they would confirm that the person in the document was in fact Peter Williams, the former boss of L3Harris Trenchant. A spokesperson confirmed.

Finally, the story was out. A week later, Williams pleaded guilty.

When I first heard of his story, while I trusted my sources, I remained skeptical. Why would someone like Williams do what the rumors claimed? But he did, and did so for money, prosecutors allege, which Williams then used to buy a house, jewelry, and luxury watches.

It was a remarkable fall from grace for Williams, once seen as an accomplished and brilliant hacker, and especially for someone who previously worked at Australia’s top foreign spy agency and served in the country’s military.

What happened to the stolen exploits?

We still don’t know specifically which exploits and hacking tools Williams stole and sold. Trenchant estimated a loss of $35 million, per court documents. But Williams’ lawyers said the stolen tools were not classified as a government secret.

We can glean some insight based on the circumstances of the case.

Given that the Justice Department said the stolen tools could be used to hack “millions of computers and devices,” it’s likely the tools refer to zero-days in popular consumer software, such as Android devices, Apple’s iPhones and iPads, and web browsers.

There is some evidence pointing in their direction. During a hearing last year, prosecutors read out loud a post published on X by Operation Zero, according to independent cybersecurity reporter Kim Zetter, who attended the hearing.

“Due to high demand on the market, we’re increasing payouts for top-tier mobile exploits,” read the post, which specifically mentioned Android and iOS. “As always, the end user is a non-NATO country.”

Operation Zero offers millions of dollars for details of security vulnerabilities in Android devices and iPhones, messaging apps like Telegram, as well as other kinds of software, such as Microsoft Windows, and hardware vendors, such as several brands of servers and routers.

Operation Zero claims to work with the Russian government. At the time Williams sold the exploits to the Russian broker, Putin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine was already underway.

On the same day that Williams was sentenced, the U.S. Treasury announced it had imposed sanctions against Operation Zero and its founder Sergey Zelenyuk, calling the company a national security threat. This was the government’s first confirmation that Williams had sold the exploits to Operation Zero.

In its statement, the Treasury said the broker “sold those stolen tools to at least one unauthorized user.” At this point we don’t know who this user is. The user could be a foreign intelligence service, or it could be a ransomware gang, given that the Treasury also sanctioned Oleg Vyacheslavovich Kucherov, an alleged member of the Trickbot gang, who also allegedly worked with Operation Zero.

In a court document, prosecutors said that L3Harris was able to figure out that “an unauthorized vendor was selling a component” of one of the stolen trade secrets “by comparing company-specific vendor data found on a stolen component that matched.”

Prosecutors also said that Williams “recognized code he wrote and sold” to Operation Zero “being utilized by a South Korean broker,” further suggesting that both L3Harris and prosecutors know which tools were stolen and sold to Operation Zero.

Another unanswered question is: Did anyone, either the U.S. government or L3Harris, alert Apple, Google, or whichever tech company’s products were affected by the zero-day flaws, now that the exploits had leaked?

Any company or developer would want to know that someone could have used (or could still use) a zero-day against their users and customers so that they can patch the flaws as soon as possible. And at this point, the zero-days are of no use for L3Harris and its government customers.

When I asked Apple and Google, neither company responded to my inquiries. L3Harris did not respond either.

Who hacked the scapegoat, and why?

Then there’s the mystery of the scapegoat, who was fired after Williams accused him of stealing and leaking code.

At sentencing, Justice Department prosecutors confirmed that the employee was fired, saying Williams “stood idly by while another employee of the company was essentially blamed for [his] own conduct.” In response, Williams’ attorney rebuffed prosecutors, claiming that the former employee “was fired for misconduct,” citing claims of dual-employment and improper handling of the company’s intellectual property.

According to a court document submitted by Williams’ lawyers, as part of the L3Harris internal investigation, the company placed the employee on leave, seized his devices, transferred them to the U.S., and “offered them to the FBI.”

When reached for comment, an unnamed FBI spokesperson said the bureau had nothing to add apart from the Justice Department’s press release.

After being fired, that employee, whom we identified with the alias Jay Gibson, received a notification from Apple that his personal iPhone was targeted “with a mercenary spyware attack.”

Apple sends these notifications to users it thinks were the target of attacks using tools like those made by NSO Group or Intellexa.

Who tried to hack Gibson? He received the notification on March 5, 2025, more than six months after the FBI investigation had begun. The FBI “regularly interacted with [Williams] in late 2024 through the summer of 2025,” according to a court document.

Given the nature of the leaked tools, it is plausible that the FBI, or perhaps even a U.S. intelligence agency, targeted Gibson as part of the investigation into Williams’ leaks. But we just don’t know, and there’s a chance that neither the public, nor Gibson, will ever find out.

Updated to clarify 22nd paragraph attributing the tools’ lack of classification to Williams’ lawyers.

Former L3Harris Trenchant boss jailed for selling hacking tools to Russian broker

Peter Williams, a former U.S. defense contractor boss, was sentenced on Tuesday to seven years in prison for stealing and selling his former company’s hacking and surveillance tools to a Russian firm.

Reporters with Bloomberg and Cyberscoop first reported Williams’ sentencing.

Williams was the general manager of Trenchant, a division of the defense contractor L3Harris that sells hacking and surveillance tools — typically known as zero-days — to the U.S. government and a select group of its top allies, known as the Five Eyes, including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.

Last year, Williams, 39, an Australian citizen who resides in Washington, D.C., pleaded guilty to selling seven Trenchant trade secrets to a Russian broker. While prosecutors didn’t name the company at the time, the U.S. Treasury Department confirmed on Tuesday that the broker is Operation Zero and announced sanctions against the company.

Operation Zero offers millions of dollars for details of security vulnerabilities in Android and iPhone devices, as well as messaging apps like Telegram. Operation Zero claims to resell the tools it acquires exclusively to the Russian government and local companies.

The U.S. Department of Justice alleged that the hacking tools Williams sold could have allowed the end customer to “potentially access millions of computers and devices around the world.” Williams, who previously worked for an Australian spy agency and the country’s military, admitted that he made $1.3 million in crypto from the sales between 2022 and 2025.

L3Harris and Williams’ lawyers did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Automotive marketplace CarGurus was the target of a data breach in which the names, email addresses, phone numbers, and physical addresses of millions of customers were stolen.

Have I Been Pwned, a data-breach notification site provided by security researcher Troy Hunt, reported that 12.5 million CarGurus accounts were compromised in the data breach.

CarGurus, founded in 2006, operates an online marketplace that allows customers to buy, sell, and finance vehicle purchases.

Have I Been Pwned attributed the breach to the ShinyHunters hacking group.

The ShinyHunters group is known for its social engineering skills, such as calling up help desks and pretending to be employees who need their password reset. The hackers have used their social engineering skills to steal reams of data from several universities and over a billion records from Salesforce customers, including Google and Workday, and they claimed recent hacks at Pornhub and fintech lending giant Figure.

CarGurus spokesperson Maggie Meluzio confirmed to TechCrunch that the company experienced a cybersecurity incident, which is now contained.

“there are no indications that dealer data feeds, APIs, or core systems or products used by our consumers or dealer partners have been compromised. We remain fully operational, and our services continue without interruption. We will notify any affected individuals in accordance with applicable laws,” said Meluzio.

CarGurus did not dispute Have I Been Pwned’s figure.

The customer data that was published included user account ID mappings, finance prequalification application data, and dealer account and subscription information, according to Have I Been Pwned.

This is the second automotive-related data breach reported by Have I Been Pwned this year. Last month, data allegedly from CarMax was published following a failed extortion attempt, the data breach notification site reported. The data breach included about 431,000 unique email addresses along with names, phone numbers, and physical addresses.

Updated Wednesday with comment from CarGurus.

Einer aktuellen Studie zufolge sind Hacker dank KI innerhalb eines Jahres um 65 Prozent schneller geworden.

Color4260 / Shutterstock

Crowdstrike hat die aktuelle Ausgabe seines Global Threat Report veröffentlicht – mit mehreren bemerkenswerten Erkenntnissen.

So benötigte ein Angreifer im Jahr 2025 im Schnitt nur noch 29 Minuten, um sich vollständigen Zugriff auf ein Netzwerk zu verschaffen. Damit läuft die Kompromittierung rund 65 Prozent schneller ab, als im Vorjahr.

Schnellste Breakout-Time aller Zeiten

Die schnellste gemessene Zeit lag sogar bei 27 Sekunden – im Vergleich zu 51 Sekunden im Jahr 2024. In einem Fall begann die Datenexfiltration innerhalb von nur vier Minuten nach dem initialen Zugriff.

Als Hauptgrund für diese Entwicklung führt Crowdstrike den zunehmenden Einsatz von KI-Tools bei Cyberangriffen an. So hätten Angreifer, die KI nutzen, ihre Aktivitäten um 89 Prozent erhöht.

Den Sicherheitsforschern zufolge setzen insbesondere staatlich unterstützte und kriminelle Gruppen zunehmend KI ein, um ihre Angriffe effizienter zu gestalten:

So habe die Russland-nahe Cybercrime-Gruppe „Fancy Bear“ die LLM-basierte Malware „Lamehug“ genutzt, um ihre Informationsbeschaffung zu automatisieren.

Und die Hackerbande „Punk Spider“ konnte mithilfe KI-generierter Skripte sowohl Zugangsdaten deutlich schneller extrahieren als auch forensische Spuren beseitigen.

Die Nordkorea-nahe Gruppe „Famous Chollima“ wiederum setzte KI-generierte Identitäten ein, um Insider-Operationen im größeren Maßstab durchzuführen.

„Es ist ein Wettrüsten im Bereich der Künstlichen Intelligenz“, erklärt Adam Meyers, Head of Counter Adversary Operations bei CrowdStrike. „Die Breakout-Time ist das deutlichste Signal, wie sich die Angriffe verändert haben. KI verkürzt die Zeit zwischen Intention und Durchführung und macht gleichzeitig KI-Systeme in Unternehmen zu Zielen. Security-Teams müssen schneller sein als die Angreifer, um zu gewinnen.“

[52] CSO Online - China-linked hackers used Google Sheets to spy on telecoms and governments across 42 countries
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[TAM METİN - 844 kelime]
The GRIDTIDE backdoor concealed its traffic within routine spreadsheet activity for years before Google shut down the operation last week.

Google has disrupted a China-linked espionage group that used Google’s spreadsheet application as a covert spy tool to compromise telecom providers and government agencies across 42 countries, sending commands and receiving stolen data through it, Google’s Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) said on Thursday.

Working with Mandiant, GTIG confirmed intrusions at 53 organizations across 42 countries, with suspected infections in at least 20 more. The group, identified by Google as UNC2814, is a suspected PRC-nexus actor that GTIG has tracked since 2017.

“This prolific, elusive actor has a long history of targeting international governments and global telecommunications organizations across Africa, Asia, and the Americas,” GTIG said in a blog post.

Unlike Salt Typhoon, UNC2814, the China-linked group whose intrusions into US telecom carriers drew scrutiny from Congress and federal regulators last year, operates with distinct tactics and targets a different set of victims globally, the post added.

How UNC2814 gains its initial foothold has not been determined, though GTIG said the group has a history of exploiting and compromising web servers and edge systems. Once inside, it deployed a novel backdoor and maintained persistent access across target networks.

A spreadsheet repurposed as a spy tool

That backdoor, which GTIG named GRIDTIDE, did not communicate the way most malware does. “The backdoor leverages Google Sheets as a high-availability C2 platform, treating the spreadsheet not as a document, but as a communication channel to facilitate the transfer of raw data and shell commands,” GTIG said.

The attackers wrote commands into spreadsheet cells and retrieved stolen data from them the same way. The malware polled the sheet every second for new instructions, wrote status updates back on task completion, and wiped the first 1,000 rows at the start of each session to erase traces of prior activity, the blog post explained.

“This activity is not the result of a security vulnerability in Google’s products; rather, it abuses legitimate Google Sheets API functionality to disguise C2 traffic,” GTIG added.

“The most unsettling detail about the GRIDTIDE backdoor is how it abuses legitimate Google Sheets API calls to function as its C2 channel, while still utilizing techniques like ‘living off the land’ to blend in with regular enterprise activities,” Andrew Costis, manager of the Adversary Research Team at AttackIQ, said. “This camouflage buys attackers time by slipping past the triggers defenders rely on, like obvious malware signatures or noisy beaconing, and hiding inside the same cloud app patterns teams are used to seeing.”

How Mandiant found it

The campaign came to light during a Mandiant Threat Defense investigation, when analysts flagged unusual activity on a CentOS server. A binary named xapt, designed to masquerade as the apt package manager on Debian-based Linux systems, had already escalated to root and was running shell commands to confirm its access level, GTIG said.

The attacker had the highest available privileges on the system before the alert was raised.

From that foothold, the threat actor used a service account to move laterally via SSH, deployed living-off-the-land binaries for reconnaissance, and installed GRIDTIDE as a persistent systemd service to survive reboots. The threat actor also deployed SoftEther VPN Bridge to maintain an encrypted outbound channel.

“VPN configuration metadata suggests UNC2814 has been leveraging this specific infrastructure since July 2018,” GTIG said.

The extent of that access became clear when investigators examined what the attackers were targeting.

The real target was individuals

The attackers planted GRIDTIDE on endpoints that held personally identifiable information, including full names, phone numbers, dates of birth, voter IDs, and national ID numbers.

“We assess the targeting of PII in this engagement is consistent with cyber espionage activity in telecommunications, which is primarily leveraged to identify, track, and monitor persons of interest,” GTIG said in the post.

GTIG did not directly observe exfiltration during this campaign, but noted that “historical PRC-nexus espionage intrusions against telecoms have resulted in the theft of call data records, unencrypted SMS messages, and the compromise and abuse of lawful intercept systems.”

Chinese cyberespionage groups have consistently prioritized telecommunications as a target precisely because of the access their networks provide to sensitive communications and lawful intercept infrastructure.

“When telecom firms and government agencies are in the blast radius, the stakes go beyond one company’s incident report,” Costis said. “Access to telecom environments can enable broad intelligence collection, help map relationships, and create opportunities for long-term monitoring that is hard to unravel once compromised.”

To dismantle the operation, GTIG terminated all Google Cloud projects controlled by the attackers, disabled their accounts, revoked Google Sheets API access, and sinkholed current and historical C2 domains. It said it has also notified affected organizations and published indicators of compromise through Google Threat Intelligence, including IP addresses, domains, and file hashes tied to UNC2814.

[53] CSO Online - The farmers and the mercenaries: Rethinking the ‘human layer’ in security

[TAM METİN - 980 kelime]
Why we're asking the wrong people to save us.

There’s a phrase that’s become gospel in cybersecurity: “Employees are the last line of defense.”

We’ve built an entire industry around it. Billions of dollars in security awareness programs, mandatory simulations and user-reporting workflows across endpoints, applications and collaboration tools. All predicated on a premise that sounds reasonable until you examine what we’re actually asking.

Here’s what we’re asking: for the marketing coordinator, the accounts payable clerk and the sales rep to catch what sophisticated security tools and trained professionals missed.

That’s not a security strategy. That’s asking farmers to repel mercenaries.

The hierarchy we don’t talk about

Think of the actual defensive capabilities in a typical organization.

Your security team has years of specialized training, access to SIEM platforms, threat intelligence feeds and forensics tools. Their full-time job is defense.

Your CISO has decades of experience, strategic visibility across the organization and the authority to make architectural decisions. Defense is their entire professional identity.

Your employees have a short annual training module, a reporting workflow and whatever attention they can spare from the job they were actually hired to do.

We’ve built a multi-billion dollar industry around the idea that the third group will succeed where the first two are failing.

The evidence is already in

This isn’t a theoretical complaint — it shows up in research on how real SOCs work. A study by the University of Oxford based on surveys and interviews with SOC practitioners found they “confirmed the high” false-positive rates of tools in use, and that many “false positives” are actually benign triggers that still require human validation.

That’s not employee failure. That’s employees doing exactly what we trained them to do — and the training is producing volume rather than clarity.

User reporting systems have become noise amplifiers. Employees are encouraged to flag anything that feels out of pattern: unusual access prompts, unexpected system messages, automated workflows, new integrations, time-sensitive requests. These signals once indicated risk. Today, they often reflect how modern, automated businesses actually operate. The cues we taught employees to distrust increasingly describe normal work.

Meanwhile, SOC teams are drowning. It’s not just the queues — it’s the human cost. ISACA’s 2024 research found 66% of cybersecurity professionals say the job is more stressful now than it was five years ago, citing a more complex threat landscape alongside resourcing constraints.

And our answer is: the accountants will save us.

Here’s the contrarian take the industry needs to hear: the ‘human layer’ that matters isn’t your employees. It’s your security team.

When we talk about the human element in security, we should be talking about the CISOs running on four hours of sleep during an incident. The analysts pattern-matching across thousands of signals. The threat hunters who notice something slightly off in authentication logs. The architects who see the structural weakness before it becomes a breach.

These are elite defenders. Trained professionals. The actual human intelligence in your security posture.

If they can’t keep up — if their capacity is consumed by false positive triage, user-submitted reports, operational escalations and the constant pressure to clear queues — then no amount of awareness training for end users is going to close that gap.

You don’t compensate for overwhelmed special forces by handing rifles to farmers.

The uncomfortable math

Let me walk through what’s actually happening in most organizations:

The security team receives hundreds of alerts daily. Many originate from automated controls, user reporting workflows and precautionary detections designed to err on the side of caution. A significant percentage require investigation — you can’t know something is harmless until you look. Each investigation takes 15–20 minutes. The math quickly consumes 100% of available analyst capacity.

When false positive volume hits capacity, strategic threat hunting drops to zero. There’s no time for pattern recognition across multiple signals, correlation with threat intelligence or the slow careful analysis that catches sophisticated attacks.

The sophisticated attacks don’t announce themselves. They wait in queue, looking like everything else. Detection becomes random — a function of luck, not design.

This is the crisis facing the actual human layer of defense. And we’re addressing it by asking frontline employees to identify subtle anomalies in systems and workflows that already passed through layers of automated controls.

I’m not arguing that baseline security hygiene is worthless. Employees should follow sensible practices and avoid obviously risky behavior. Basic discipline matters.

But we’ve elevated awareness training from ‘basic hygiene’ to ‘strategic defense,’ and that elevation is dangerous. It creates a false sense of coverage. It allows organizations to underinvest in actual defensive capability because they’ve ‘addressed the human element.’

The human element that needs addressing is your security team’s capacity. Their tools, their processes, their ability to do strategic work instead of drowning in noise.

Even regulators and standards bodies implicitly acknowledge the same bottleneck: monitoring has to be implemented in a way that minimizes false positives and false negatives — because human review capacity is finite.

The question worth asking

Every CISO should be asking: What percentage of my security team’s capacity is consumed by work that doesn’t actually reduce risk?

If the answer is ‘most of it’ — if your analysts spend their days clearing precautionary alerts, reviewing benign activity and responding to internal escalations driven by uncertainty rather than threat — then you have a human layer problem.

But the solution isn’t more training for end users. It’s restoring capacity to the people actually trained to defend you.

The farmers have fields to tend. Let them farm.

The question is whether your mercenaries have room to fight.

[54] CSO Online - 5 trends that should top CISO’s RSA 2026 agendas
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Thu, 26 Feb 2026 07:00:00 +0000
Link: https://www.csoonline.com/article/4136999/5-trends-that-should-top-cisos-rsa-2026-agendas.html

[TAM METİN - 1485 kelime]
AI will dominate RSA’s presentations and discussions. To separate hopeful hype from practical solutions, security leaders should approach the conference with curiosity, optimism, suspicion, and a strategic plan.

RSA 2026 is still weeks away and the hype machine is humming. This year’s theme, “The Power of Community,” is somewhat ironic as the overwhelming chatter at the Moscone Center in San Francisco from March 23 to March 26 will be about AI agents, not humans.

Welcome to the cybersecurity community, agents, automatons, and robots!

While cybersecurity is an extremely diverse area covering everything from humans to critical infrastructure, here are five cybersecurity areas certain to have a starring role at RSA 2026 — and worthy of being on any CISO’s attendance agenda.

The rise of the AI-SOC

In 2026, we are moving beyond AI copilots toward autonomous agents performing traditional security operations center (SOC) activities such as triaging alerts, investigating malicious activity, isolating hosts, and patching software on our behalf. The trend is expected to reshape operations in the SOC even if the early realities haven’t yet fully aligned with agentic expectations.

Still, there’s a lot of innovation happening from established vendors (e.g., Cisco/Splunk, CrowdStrike, Google, Microsoft, etc.) and startups (e.g., Andesite, Crogl, Prophet Security, etc.) alike. While AI-SOCs have potential, security pros remain leery about AI hallucinations and “black box” tools, and agents will succeed or fail based on a foundation of accurate and timely data access — threat intelligence, log files, tools integration, and so on.

For RSA attendees, I recommend cautious optimism. One way or another the AI-SOC is coming — and sooner than you think. But CISOs should come prepared with requirements, lots of questions, and a willingness to cast a wide net rather than simply defaulting to existing tools vendors.

CTEM in the spotlight

In another evolutionary trend, most organizations are moving beyond scanning for software snafus to continuous threat exposure management (CTEM). By doing so, security teams hope to get a full picture of all assets, as well as their configurations, locations, software vulnerabilities, ownership, and business criticality.

Armed with this data, CTEM platforms look at threat intelligence to assess adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), helping organizations prioritize which vulnerable assets represent the highest risks to the business. Some tools can even predict which assets may be most vulnerable to future exploits.

CTEM tools from vendors such as Nucleus Security, ServiceNow (Armis), and Tenable (Vulcan Security) will be front and center at RSA but there’s a confusing cast of thousands in this space. While promising, CTEM done wrong will just add another tool to the security stack.

Before succumbing to the shining objects at RSA, security teams should audit — and clean up — their data, define “crown jewel” assets, create their own risk scoring system, and build a mobilization plan for emergency and day-to-day patching processes between security and IT teams.

Cyber resilience takes center stage

According to Special Publication 800-160, Volume 2, from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), cyber resilience is defined as: “The ability to anticipate, withstand, recover from, and adapt to adverse conditions, stresses, attacks, or compromises on systems that use or are enabled by cyber resources.”

Note the expansive definition. Anticipating threats requires threat intelligence analysis, solid and continuous exposure management, and effective security controls. Withstanding and recovering from threats demands rapid detection, incident response, solid data backup and restoration, and a formal — and tested — business continuity and disaster recovery plan. Adapting involves security technology tuning, detection rules engineering, targeted investments, and CISO leadership.

Obviously, there’s no one product that covers the entire spectrum but that won’t stop some vendors from claiming they are in the cyber-resilience business. Caveat emptor, my cybersecurity friends.

Identity as the ‘new’ security perimeter

Anyone remember the Jericho Forum circa 2004? The group argued that since data was moving outside the corporate network, security should be attached to data and user identity, rather than the physical or logical network location. Twenty-two years later, some vendors have had a similar epiphany about identity management.

Okay, beyond my snark, I’m encouraged by the focus on identity management in areas like improved identity governance (SailPoint, Saviynt), passwordless authentication (Microsoft, Okta, Ping), and identity threat detection and response (Grip Security, Permiso Security).

There is also copious use of AI in the identity space to assess user entitlements, user “liveness,” and identity configuration settings. Great stuff, but I’ve always found that identity and access management (IAM) is an area where everyone has an ownership stake but no one actually owns it. CISOs will have to work with business owners, CIOs, and application developers to address identity risks, making strategic projects lengthy and complex — a difficult environment for security startups.

Everything AI: Future-proofing security operations

All the areas above have an AI component, of course, but it’s worth carving out a discussion on AI across those and other AI cybersecurity categories here.

First, CISOs face a significant challenge in their need to secure the development and usage of AI. This includes buckets of technologies, such as model context protocol (MCP) security, AI firewalling, content sanitation, digital content authenticity, AI security posture management, AI-driven DevSecOps, and so on. These technologies should support an overall business and technology strategy and governance framework around AI.

Next, RSA will be a hotbed of AI threat chatter, with alarming discussions about vulnerability chaining, polymorphic payloads, and security control bypassing — all legitimate topics, but like defenders, adversaries are mostly using AI for research and process automation.

Attendees should focus on relevant threat intelligence while discarding profuse hype. There are too many AI sub-topics to cover, but in my humble opinion, RSA participants should pay special attention to AI-centric skills and training sessions. Given an AI-enabled future, organizations will need security data engineers and AI security specialists, rare skill sets today. And as we supplant Tier-1 analyst functions with AI, we’ll also need to upskill junior cybersecurity specialists to become AI orchestrators who excel at human-agent teaming. AI skills development and training should be a top CISO priority.

Beyond my personal top 5, here are a few honorable mentions for CISO RSA 2026 agendas:

Zero trust. This area rides shotgun with identity management and cyber-resilience strategies. As such, zero trust is still a top priority. CISOs should have an eye out for AI-enabled innovation that could accelerate their ZT implementation.

Cloud security. Between multicloud, SaaS, and AI development, cloud security remains a bear. Organizations need an organic security strategy that grows with their cloud usage. CISOs should use the conference to help hone their growing multi-cloud/SaaS security needs.

Cybersecurity platforms. There is lots of vendor money in this area as well. Security platforms are likely appropriate for most smaller firms but perhaps not for larger enterprises where the business and IT run far faster than cybersecurity. CISOs must weigh the benefits of platform efficiency against tools efficacy and rip-and-replace pain.

*DR. CDR, EDR, and XDR (etc.), oh my! There’s lots of detection and response innovation around the edges of the cloud and network that will likely lead to highly distributed security operations. CISOs should explore how these blending and evolving spaces will impact a future centralized or distributed security operations architecture.

IT and OT security. Yeah, we’ve been talking about this for years, but AI will be a force multiplier for smart devices and edge computing. For example, in the next five years, healthcare will transform based on wearable connected devices for data collection and patient care, so device availability and integrity could equate to life and death situations. Security teams can’t be left behind. Be on the lookout for evolutions in how to further secure IT/OT convergence and purpose-built AI agents for IoT/OT security.

Post quantum cryptography (PQC).  To me, this topic is hit or miss.  CISOs working for intelligence agencies, defense contractors, or financial services firms should pay attention.  Others can probably eschew this area – at least this year.

The power of community. There’s that theme again, but this isn’t hyperbole. Cybersecurity professionals already learn from each other at RSA and Black Hat, and through professional groups like the Information Systems Security Association (ISSA). I’m hoping that agents can join the community in an era of collective defense — where many organizations band together in real-time to protect one another.

With the proliferation of AI, this year’s RSA will feature more eye candy than in the past. Vendors pay millions of dollars for the chance to over stimulate users in this way. As always, security professionals should approach RSA with a list of requirements that support business strategy and technical needs. Eschew AI gaga and remember the sage words of Bruce Schneier, “Security is a process, not a product.”

Cybersicherheitsexperten verlassen sich in diversen Bereichen auf Open-Source-Lösungen – nicht zuletzt weil diese im Regelfall von einer lebendigen und nutzwertigen Community gestützt werden. Aber auch weil es inzwischen Hunderte qualitativ hochwertiger, quelloffener Optionen gibt, um Breaches und Datenlecks auf allen Ebenen des Unternehmens-Stacks zu verhindern.

Falls Sie nun gedanklich bereits die xz-utils-Backdoor-Keule bereitlegen: Ja, es kann sein, dass es in der Zukunft zu weiteren Vorfällen dieser Art kommt. Allerdings darf bezweifelt werden, dass eine ähnliche Schwachstelle in einem proprietären Stack ebenso schnell entdeckt worden wäre. Schließlich ermöglicht Open Source erst, dass unabhängige Sicherheitsexperten Probleme wie diesen zeitnah auf die Spur kommen können. Um es kurz zu machen: Die Vorteile von Open Source Tools überwiegen – auch im Bereich der Cybersicherheit – die möglichen Gefahren.

Auf die folgenden quelloffenen Security-Tools sollten CSOs, CISOs und ihre Teams nicht verzichten. Beispielsweise, um:

Schwachstellen zu identifizieren,

Protokolle zu analysieren,

Protokolle zu analysieren,

Support für Threat Intelligence und Verschlüsselung sicherzustellen.

1. ZAP für Vulnerability Scans

Bei Zed Attack Proxy – kurz ZAP – handelt es sich um ein kostenloses Open-Source-Werkzeug für Penetrationstests. Das Scanner-Tool ist darauf konzipiert, potenzielle Schwachstellen und Sicherheitslücken in Webanwendungen aufzuspüren und stützt sich dazu auf umfangreiches Community-Wissen.

Dabei sitzt ZAP zwischen Browser und der zu testenden Web-App und ist in der Lage, sämtliche Packets zu modifizieren, während es mögliche Angriffsvektoren durchläuft. Im Grunde handelt es sich um einen Proxy mit erweiterten Fähigkeiten, um nach Schwachstellen zu suchen. Dazu stellt ZAP eine Sammlung vordefinierter Angriffsmethoden zur Verfügung. Um auf spezifische Risiken zu testen, kann das quelloffene Tool auch mit benutzerdefinierten Payloads und Regeln ausgestattet werden.

ZAP wird aktiv weiterentwickelt und kann mit Blick auf kommende Features eine ambitionierte Roadmap vorweisen. Optimiertes Scripting ist dort ebenso vertreten wie ein breiterer Support für Protokolle wie gRPC. Das Tool steht in Form diverser Installer für alle gängigen Betriebssysteme zum Download zur Verfügung.

2. Wireshark für Paketanalysen

Ein Auge auf die Kommunikationslinien im Netzwerk zu werfen, ist eine der zielführendsten Methoden, um Datenlecks aufzuspüren. Für diese Zwecke ist Wireshark ein ebenso bewährtes wie hochwertiges Tool: Es analysiert die Bits, die sich durch – kabelgebundene oder auch kabellose – Netzwerke bewegen und gleicht diese mit einem Regelwerk ab, das wiederum auf den Informationen Hunderter verschiedener Networking-Quellen fußt.

Wenn Sie sich für eine bestimmte Art von Daten-Traffic interessieren, die von einem spezifischen Softwarepaket ausgeht, ist es zudem möglich, dafür entsprechende Filter zu definieren. Auch dieses Open-Source-Tool läuft auf den meisten gängigen Betriebssystemen – inklusive aller Unix-Variationen.

Die Wireshark-Community ist in den letzten Jahren weiter gewachsen und engagiert sich insbesondere in Sachen Dokumentation und Schulungsmaterialien, wie ein Blick auf die offizielle Webseite unterstreicht.

3. Bloodhound Community Edition für Incident Response

Tritt ein Security Breach auf, nutzen Security-Profis Forensik-Tools, um die Angriffswege der Angreifer nachzuvollziehen. Das geht beispielsweise mit Bloodhound Community Edition, der Open-Source-Version des bekannten Enterprise-Tools (die vom selben Team gepflegt wird).

Das Open-Source-Werkzeug sorgt für Transparenz im Beziehungsgeflecht zwischen Active-Directory- und Azure-Umgebungen und ist so in der Lage, auch hochkomplexe “Attack Paths” zu identifizieren und die in diesem Rahmen gefundenen Sicherheitslücken zu schließen. Das Tool ist sowohl für Red- als auch für Blue Teams geeignet.

4. Autopsy für Cyberforensik

Bei Autopsy handelt es sich um eine quelloffene IT-Forensik-Plattform, um Festplatten(-Images) gründlich zu untersuchen. Dabei lässt sich die Software über zahlreiche Module auch erweitern, um spezifische Datentypen, die mit bestimmten Kompromittierungsarten in Verbindung stehen, zu identifizieren.

Beispielsweise untersucht das “Extension Mismatch Module” die interne Struktur von Dateien und gleicht diese mit ihrer Benennung ab. Entstehen hierbei Diskrepanzen, ist das ein erster Hinweis darauf, dass Angreifer den Traffic nutzen, um etwas zu verbergen. Darüber hinaus bietet Autopsy unter anderem auch Erweiterungsmodule für Schulungen und Support.

5. MISP für Threat Intelligence

Geht es um breit angelegte, kollektive Bemühungen, können Open-Source-Tools und -Plattformen glänzen. Die Malware Information Sharing Platform – kurz MISP – ist dafür das beste Beispiel. Die Plattform kommt ins Spiel, wenn es darum geht, die Daten von IT-Forensik-Tools zu analysieren: Sie sammelt Informationen über potenzielle Angriffsvektoren in einer umfassenden Datenbank und bietet die Möglichkeit, diese Informationen über eine Suchmaschine mit eigenen Daten zu korrelieren. Dabei unterstützt die Lösung ein flexibles, objektbasiertes Datenmodell, das verschiedene Kompromittierungsindikatoren (Indicators of Compromise, IoC) visualisiert und sowohl über technische als auch nicht-technische Details Auskunft gibt. Ein Indexierungsalgorithmus der Support für “Fuzzy Matching” bietet, deckt mögliche Übereinstimmungen automatisch auf.

MISP wurde gezielt für Sicherheitsteams entwickelt, um über geteilte Timelines und Event-Graphen zusammenzuarbeiten. Dieses quelloffene Projekt wird von der Europäischen Union unterstützt und erfreut sich diverser, umfassender Communities. Die webbasierten, größtenteils in PHP geschriebenen Tools von MISP stehen auch in Quellcode-Form zum Download zur Verfügung.

6. Let’s Encrypt für Verschlüsselung

Verschlüsselungsalgorithmen schaffen die Basis für Security, Datenschutz und Authentifizierung und sind in einer ganzen Reihe von quelloffenen Bibliotheken verfügbar. Zudem stützen sich auch viele Open-Source-Tools auf diese Algorithmen.

Zum Beispiel die Skript-Sammlung Let’s Encrypt. Sie ist darauf ausgelegt, Systemadministratoren das Leben leichter zu machen, indem sie Webserver mit Encryption-Fähigkeiten ausstattet. Dazu müssen die Admins nur einige Fragen beantworten – die entsprechenden Zertifikate für die Benutzer werden automatisiert generiert und gewährleisten, dass alle Daten die in diesem Rahmen übertragen werden, geschützt sind.

7. GNU Privacy Guard für Verschlüsselung

Eine vollständige Implementierung des PGP-Standards zum Zwecke des Kommunikationsschutzes bietet GNU Privacy Guard.

Die Zielsetzung besteht dabei darin, die Endbenutzer zu befähigen, ihre E-Mail-Nachrichten zu verschlüsseln und zu signieren. Dabei werden sowohl Secure-Shell- als auch S/MIME-Interaktionen unterstützt.

8. Yara für Pattern Matching

Wenn Malware-Samples identifiziert und klassifiziert werden sollen, verlassen sich viele Schadsoftwarespezialisten auf das Open-Source-Projekt Yara.

Das quelloffene Tool kann jedoch noch mehr und ist auch in Sachen Incident Response und IT-Forensik hilfreich: Es sucht auf Grundlage vorkonfigurierter und benutzerdefinierter Regeln nach identischen Mustern in Dateien oder auch laufenden Prozessen. Zusätzlich können auch Signaturinformationen von Viren über das quelloffene Tool ClamAV sowie Regelsätze aus dem von der Community gepflegten YaraRules-Repository einfließen. Wichtig ist an dieser Stelle, sich der Grenzen der signaturbasierten Erkennung bewusst zu sein – und sich nicht ausschließlich auf dieses Open-Source-Werkzeug zu verlassen.

Yara kann entweder über die Kommandozeile ausgeführt werden oder über eine Python-Bibliothek in entsprechende Skripte integriert werden.

9. OSquery für Endpunktabfragen

Einfach per SQL-Abfrage nach bösartigen Prozessen, Plugins oder auch Sicherheitslücken auf Windows-, Mac- und Linux-Endpunkten zu suchen – das ist die Idee hinter OSquery, einem quelloffenen Tool, das von Softwareingenieuren bei Facebook entwickelt wurde.

Die Software sammelt Betriebssysteminformationen wie laufende Prozesse, geladene Kernelmodule, offene Netzwerkverbindungen, Browser-Plugins oder Datei-Hashes in einer relationalen Datenbank. Diese können Sie mit einfachen SQL Queries abfragen – ganz ohne komplexen Python-Code. Damit löst OSquery ein bedeutendes Problem auf unkomplizierte und elegante Weise.

Zu den Komponenten des Tools gehören die interaktive OSqueryi-Shell, die mit PowerShell genutzt werden kann sowie der Daemon OSqueryd, der für (Low-Level) Host Monitoring zum Einsatz kommt, und es ermöglicht, Datenbankabfragen zu planen. (fm)

[56] CSO Online - So rechtfertigen Sie Ihre Security-Investitionen
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Budget-Diskussionen sind lästig, denn Cyberrisiken und Ausgaben steigen gleichermaßen. CISOs sollten daher ihre Argumentation auf Unternehmensziele ausrichten.

Miha Creative – shutterstock.com

In modernen Unternehmensumgebungen werden Investitionen in Sicherheitstechnologien nicht mehr nur anhand ihres technischen Reifegrades beurteilt. Die Finanzierung hängt vermehrt davon ab, inwieweit sich damit Umsatz generieren lässt, Risiken gemindert und Mehrwerte für Aktionäre geschaffen werden. Von CISOs wird erwartet, dass sie ihre Strategien nicht als technische Upgrades, sondern als Wegbereiter für Umsatzsteigerungen präsentieren. Die Herausforderung besteht dabei nicht nur darin, die richtigen Investitionsentscheidungen zu treffen, sondern diese auch auf Vorstandsebene zu rechtfertigen.

Am Anfang muss die Herausforderung stehen

CISOs geraten oft in Erklärungsnot, wenn sie Lösungen präsentieren, bevor die Herausforderung definiert ist. Ein solches Vorgehen schafft Distanz anstelle von Übereinstimmung. Vorstände wollen verstehen, was ihre Organisation mit einem neuen Lösungsansatz erreichen kann, welche Fallstricke vermieden werden und warum Cybersecurity-Investitionen nicht aufschiebbar sind.

Bei der Präsentation einer Cybersicherheitsstrategie wie Zero Trust sollte deshalb der Kommunikationsschwerpunkt mit dem Vorstand darauf liegen, wie das Cyberrisiko-Profil des Unternehmens zum Positiven verändert werden kann.

Technologie mit strategischen Prioritäten verknüpfen

Um in der Vorstandsetage glaubwürdig zu sein, müssen CISOs ihre geplanten Ausgaben anhand der Unternehmenszielsetzung definieren. Der Vorstand konzentriert sich auf Prioritäten wie neue Märkte zu erschließen, die Margen zu verbessern, die Widerstandsfähigkeit zu steigern und die Compliance zu gewährleisten. Ein gut durchdachter Vorschlag knüpft direkt an diese Anliegen an.

Wenn eine Sicherheitsplattform die Reaktionszeit bei Vorfällen verkürzt, ist das Ergebnis operative Stabilität und damit eine höhere Resilienz. Wenn sie Tools konsolidiert, sorgt sie für Kosteneffizienz. Wenn sie eine sichere Expansion in neue Regionen ermöglicht, ist Umsatzwachstum die Folge. Eine solche Argumentationskette schafft Glaubwürdigkeit und hilft dabei, Investitionen bewilligt zu bekommen.

Eine Sprache für Risiken und Rendite

Vorstände treffen Entscheidungen unter der Berücksichtigung von Begrifflichkeiten wie Risiko und Rendite. Dazu gehören finanzielle Risiken, operative Risiken und Reputationsrisiken für das Unternehmen. Vorstandsmitglieder bewerten Wahrscheinlichkeit, Exposition und Auswirkungen von Vorfällen in jedem dieser Bereiche. Dementsprechend besteht die Aufgabe des CISOs darin, zu verdeutlichen, wie eine vorgeschlagene Investition Schwachstellen reduziert, Auswirkungen von Vorfällen begrenzt oder die Resilienz der Infrastruktur erhöht.

Diese Gespräche sollten Kostenmodelle, Szenarien für mögliche Sicherheitsverletzungen, Zeitpläne für die Wiederherstellung nach einem Cyberangriff und den geschäftlichen Nutzen aufzeigen. Das Ziel sollte sein, Ausfallzeiten zu vermeiden und dabei die Sprache der Vorstände zu sprechen, ohne die technische Integrität zu vernachlässigen.

Shareholder Value bedenken

Der Reifegrad und auch die Denkweisen von Vorständen in Bezug auf die Cybersicherheit variieren deutlich. Einige Kontrollgremien reagieren erst nach einem größeren Cybervorfall oder einem nicht bestandenen Audit. Andere sind sehr viel proaktiver in ihrer Vorgehensweise und fordern Cybersicherheitsbewertungen als Teil ihrer Marktexpansion oder M&A-Aktivitäten. Andere beziehen Cybersicherheit in Simulationen ein und stellen zukunftsorientierte Fragen zur Widerstandsfähigkeit angesichts potenzieller Angriffsszenarien.

Das Verständnis dieses Reifegrades hilft dabei, die Kommunikationsstrategie anzupassen. Ein reaktiver Vorstand benötigt möglicherweise eine klare Erklärung der negativen Folgen. Ein informierter Vorstand erwartet eher quantifizierbare Ergebnisse und eine Roadmap. Die besten Vorstandsdiskussionen finden statt, wenn sich der CISO an das Technologieverständnis des Vorstands anpasst und gleichzeitig dessen Perspektive behutsam erweitert.

Lesetipp: 10 Kennzahlen, die CISOs weiterbringen

Operative Exzellenz als Ergebnis positionieren

Eines der wirksamsten Argumente in den Gesprächen mit dem Vorstand zum Thema Cybersicherheit ist operative Exzellenz. Wenn Unternehmen in unterschiedlichen Regionen und Branchen tätig sind, müssen sie agil, abgesichert und kontrolliert arbeiten. Eine IT-Architektur sollte

globale Anforderungen adressieren und

dabei Mitarbeitende unterstützen, die von überall aus arbeiten,

Drittparteien integrieren,

eine Reihe von regulatorischen Anforderungen erfüllen und

geistiges Eigentum schützen.

Ein derart umfangreiches Anforderungsprofil kann sehr schnell zu einer komplexen Umsetzung und dadurch zu Ineffizienzen führen. CISOs setzen mit einer starken Technologiestrategie auf eine vereinfachte Infrastruktur, ermöglichen sichere globale Datenflüsse und verkürzen Markteintrittszeiten. Eine solche Positionierung hebt die Diskussion von der Systemauswahl auf eine strategische Ebene.

Zukünftige Risiken im Fokus

Von einem Vorstand wird erwartet, dass er sich nicht nur auf aktuelle Risiken konzentriert, sondern auch auf zukünftige Szenarien. Dazu gehören beispielsweise die Regulierung der ethischen Nutzung von KI, das Verständnis der Auswirkungen von Datenmissbrauch und die Vorbereitung auf die Auswirkungen des Quantencomputings. Der Vorstand wird für den sicheren und regulierten Umgang mit Daten verantwortlich und sogar haftbar gemacht. Dies sind keine abstrakten Themen mehr. Deshalb sollten sie bereits jetzt als künftige technologische Herausforderungen auf der CISO-Agenda stehen.

Die Nutzung von KI hat in Unternehmen zugenommen und Vorstände haben für die Verwendung von Daten geradezustehen. Quantencomputing ist zwar noch im Anfangsstadium, aber das Risiko der zukünftigen Technologie für heutige Verschlüsselungen macht es schon jetzt zu einem notwendigen Bestandteil jeder langfristigen Planung. Viele CISOs nutzen die Chance bereits, das Thema beim Vorstand zu positionieren und zu erklären, welche Maßnahmen in absehbarer Zukunft zum Schutz der Daten erforderlich sind.

Die finanzielle Ausgestaltung ist genauso wichtig wie die strategische Vorgehensweise. Da immer mehr Unternehmen von hardwareintensiven Architekturen zu Cloud-nativen SaaS- Modellen übergehen, verändert sich die Wirtschaftlichkeit der Sicherheit. Die Kosten verlagern sich von Kapitalausgaben zu Betriebsausgaben. Dies kann zwar zunächst zu einer Verringerung des EBITDA (betriebswirtschaftliche Kennzahl/Earnings Before Interest,Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization) führen, eliminiert jedoch auch Hardware-Erneuerungszyklen, verbessert die Prognosegenauigkeit und senkt die langfristigen Gesamtbetriebskosten.

Abrechnungsmodelle pro User für Cloud-Services sorgen für Vorhersehbarkeit und höhere Flexibilität als Reaktion auf Veränderungen. Weiteres Einsparpotenzial besteht in der Konsolidierung von Tools auf wenige Plattformanbieter. Zusätzlich kann die Automatisierung von Prozessen den Service Desk entlasten und die Produktivität verbessern.

Letztlich sollten CISOs aufzeigen, wie potenzielle Investitionen in neue Technologien den Cashflow verbessern, Margen sichern und mit dem Unternehmenswachstum skalieren. CFOs und Prüfungsausschüsse möchten wissen, wie sich jeder Vorschlag auf die Finanzergebnisse auswirkt. Sie möchten auch verstehen, was kapitalisiert werden kann, welche Ausgleichseffekte zu erwarten sind und wie sich die Investitionen mit der Nachfrage entwickeln werden.

Letztendlich geht es bei der Rechtfertigung von Security-Investitionen nicht um Überzeugungsarbeit, sondern um Einflussnahme. Es geht darum, die Geschäftsprioritäten mit sicheren, skalierbaren und kostengünstigen Lösungen in Einklang zu bringen.

Dementsprechend müssen CISOs eine Strategie präsentieren, die Risiken reduziert, die Agilität verbessert und das Unternehmen für langfristigen Erfolg positioniert. Wenn die IT-Führungsriege die Sprache des Mehrwerts von Lösungsansätzen spricht, klingen ihre Vorschläge nicht mehr wie technische Anforderungen, sondern wie geschäftliche Notwendigkeiten. (jm)

[57] CSO Online - Steaelite RAT combines data theft and ransomware management capability in one tool
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[TAM METİN - 759 kelime]
Researchers at BlackFog say the SaaS tool lowers the barrier to end-to-end ransomware campaigns.

It’s bad enough that threat actors are leveraging AI for their attacks, but now they can also access a new remote access trojan (RAT) that makes it easy to launch data theft and ransomware attacks on Windows computers from a single management pane.

The tool is called Steaelite, and according to researchers at BlackFog, it’s been advertised and available to customers on underground cybercrime sites since last November. In addition, there’s a promotional video on YouTube showing off its capabilities.

The tool could lower the barrier to the execution of sophisticated, end-to-end ransomware campaigns.

But BlackFog CEO Darren Williams told CSO that this isn’t the most sophisticated RAT he’s seen. “The novel aspect here,” he said, “is the convergence. Steaelite bundles remote access, credential harvesting, data exfiltration, and ransomware (currently in development) in a single package.”

Traditionally, he explained, these capabilities have occupied different parts of the cybercrime toolchain, but Steaelite unifies the functions, giving operators persistent access, surveillance, and data theft from a single browser-based dashboard. And once the ransomware module has been completed, “operators will be able to exfiltrate data first and encrypt second, enabling double extortion without switching tools, which is quite rare.”

That’s enough power “to fully compromise a business,” he noted. “The damage scales with the victim’s access, so one infected employee with privileged credentials could hand over the keys to the entire environment.”

Just over a decade ago, a researcher counted more than 250 RATs, and threat actors continue to create new RATs to evade evolving defenses; today Malwarebytes lists the currently best known RATs as SubSeven, Back Orifice, ProRat, Turkojan and Poison-Ivy.

And earlier this month, security researchers at Point Wild disclosed yet another Windows malware campaign that uses a multi-stage infection chain to establish persistent, memory-resident access on compromised systems and steal sensitive data.

RATs are spread in many ways, including by employees clicking on phishing lures and by threat actors tricking staff into installing what they’re told is necessary software. Because of that, security awareness training is a prime defense.

What Steaelite includes

The browser-based Steaelite toolkit includes modules for remote code execution, file management, live streaming, webcam and microphone access, process management, clipboard monitoring, password recovery, installed program enumeration, location tracking, arbitrary file execution, URL opening, DDoS attacks, and VB.NET payload compilation.

As well, an ‘advanced tools’ panel provides ransomware deployment, hidden RDP (remote desktop management) access, the ability to disable Windows Defender and exclusion management, and persistence installation.

Real-time screen streaming ability shows the victim’s desktop with a “LIVE STREAM” indicator. “Combined with webcam and microphone modules, this turns Steaelite into a persistent surveillance platform for as long as the victim remains connected,” says the report.

The ‘developer tools’ panel adds keylogging, client-to-victim chat, file searching, USB spreading, bot killing (for removing competing malware), message box delivery, wallpaper modification, UAC bypass, and a clipper that swaps cryptocurrency wallet addresses with an attacker-controlled address during copy-paste operations.

Perhaps most worrisome for CSOs and infosec leaders, the tool allows a single threat actor to browse the victim’s files, exfiltrate documents, harvest credentials, and deploy ransomware – in other words, to enable double extortion –  from the same dashboard.

Usually double extortion requires separate tools or steps, says BlackFog: malware for initial access and exfiltration, then a separate ransomware payload for encryption, often involving co-ordination between initial access brokers and ransomware affiliates.

In fact, the report says, the automated credential harvesting means data theft begins before the criminal operator even interacts with the dashboard.

The Android ransomware module on the tool’s roadmap extends this further, says the report. “If the developer delivers [the ransomware module], a single Steaelite licence could cover both corporate Windows endpoints and the mobile devices employees use for authentication and messaging.”

Steaelite is malware-as-a-service. The seller quotes $200 per month for access, or $500 for three months, with buyers contacting the seller through Telegram to arrange payment and receive access.

Defenders should focus on data exfiltration prevention rather than just perimeter defense, said Williams. “Tools like Steaelite assume they will get past initial defenses and prioritize getting data out fast,” he said. “Stopping the exfiltration at the point it happens is more reliable than trying to prevent every possible initial infection vector.”

[58] CSO Online - Five Eyes issue emergency directive on exploited Cisco SD-WAN zero-day
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Wed, 25 Feb 2026 22:49:14 +0000
Link: https://www.csoonline.com/article/4137562/five-eyes-issue-emergency-directive-on-exploited-cisco-sd-wan-zero-day.html

[TAM METİN - 849 kelime]
The Five Eyes cybersecurity agencies warn that a critical Cisco SD-WAN vulnerability is under active exploitation and should be patched immediately.

Cybersecurity agencies across the Five Eyes alliance have issued an emergency directive warning that a critical Cisco SD-WAN vulnerability is being actively exploited to gain unauthorized access to federal networks.

Officials confirmed that threat actors are targeting core SD-WAN control systems —infrastructure that manages traffic across government and enterprise networks — and urged organizations to patch affected devices immediately.

Cisco’s Talos threat intelligence group disclosed that attackers have been exploiting a previously unknown vulnerability affecting Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN controllers, tracked as CVE-2026-20127. The flaw allows an unauthenticated attacker to bypass authentication controls and gain administrative-level access to vulnerable SD-WAN control plane components.

Talos said the activity is associated with a threat cluster it tracks as UAT-8616, and that evidence suggests exploitation may have begun as early as 2023. Successful exploitation would allow attackers to manipulate controller-to-device communications, alter network configurations, and potentially establish persistent access within enterprise environments.

Attackers are attempting active exploitation

Nick Andersen, executive assistant director for cybersecurity at the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, said during a media briefing that threat actors are actively attempting to access and potentially compromise federal networks through exploitation of the flaw, but did not identify which agencies were affected.

He also warned that the activity appears to be increasing. “We continue to see the volumetric increase in both threat actor behavior and the extension of the attack surface that they’re targeting,” Andersen said, adding that CISA is in the early stages of remediating the vulnerability. “It’s a far-reaching activity that we’ve seen and the persistent commitment of the cyber threat actor to both take advantage of SD-WAN and other technologies sort of continues to evolve within the space.”

CISA is not currently attributing the activity to a specific threat actor, Andersen noted.

Software updates available

SD-WAN controllers play a central role in orchestrating traffic across distributed enterprise networks, including branch offices and cloud environments. Compromise at the controller level could provide attackers with broad visibility and control across large portions of an organization’s network infrastructure.

In a separate security advisory, Cisco confirmed the vulnerability and released software updates to address it. According to the company, the flaw stems from insufficient validation of authentication requests within the SD-WAN peering process. An attacker sending specially crafted traffic could gain unauthorized access to the system and interact with internal interfaces.

Cisco said there are no workarounds for the vulnerability and urged customers to apply available patches immediately. The company also recommended reviewing system logs, validating controller integrity, and implementing additional hardening measures where possible.

CISA and other Five Eyes agencies advise organizations operating Cisco SD-WAN systems to prioritize patch deployment and conduct thorough compromise assessments to determine whether exploitation has already occurred.

CISA and the authoring organizations strongly urge network defenders to take the following steps immediately:

Inventory all in-scope Cisco SD-WAN systems.

Collect artifacts, including virtual snapshots and logs of SD-WAN systems.

Patch Cisco SD-WAN systems, including for CVE-2026-20127 and CVE-2022-20775.

Hunt for evidence of compromise.

Implement as outlined in Cisco’s Catalyst SD-WAN Hardening Guide and review their blog.

Disclosure comes amid strain at CISA

The disclosure comes amid heightened scrutiny of network infrastructure security. It also comes at a time when CISA, facing staffing reductions and operating under constraints tied to the ongoing Department of Homeland Security shutdown, is managing limited resources during a period of elevated threat activity.

CISA’s Andersen, however, said that despite the ongoing multi-week Department of Homeland Security shutdown, “CISA remains fully committed to protecting federal networks from a malicious separate threat.”

Emergency directives are binding on federal civilian agencies and are reserved for vulnerabilities that pose significant, immediate threats. Although the order applies specifically to government networks, CISA frequently encourages private-sector organizations to follow similar remediation timelines when critical vulnerabilities are being exploited in the wild.

Shift toward control plane targets

The coordinated disclosures from Talos, Cisco, and the government agencies highlight an ongoing shift in attacker priorities. Rather than targeting only endpoints or user-facing applications, sophisticated groups are increasingly pursuing control-plane technologies such as SD-WAN, firewalls, and identity systems that offer strategic network access.

Compromising SD-WAN infrastructure can yield high operational leverage. Because controllers manage routing, policy enforcement, and device authentication across distributed environments, an attacker with privileged access could disrupt traffic flows, redirect communications, or use the position to move laterally into cloud and on-premises assets.

The disclosures also reinforce long-standing concerns about the risk window between the discovery of a vulnerability and the deployment of patches. In this case, Talos indicated that exploitation activity may have preceded public disclosure by a significant period, suggesting that attackers were able to leverage the flaw before customers were aware of it.

Attackers used “technical assessment” projects with repeatable naming conventions to blend in cloning and build workflows, retrieving loader scripts from remote infrastructure, and minimizing on-disk traces.

Microsoft says it has uncovered a coordinated campaign targeting software developers through malicious repositories posing as legitimate Next.js projects and technical assessments. The campaign employs carefully crafted lures to blend into routine workflows, such as cloning repositories, opening projects, and running builds, thereby allowing the malicious code to execute undetected.

Telemetry collected during an incident investigation by Microsoft suggested the campaign’s alignment with a broader cluster of threats using job-themed tricks. “During initial incident analysis, Defender telemetry surfaced a limited set of malicious repositories directly involved in observed compromises,” the company wrote in a security blog post. “Further investigation uncovered additional related repositories that were not directly referenced in observed logs but exhibited the same execution mechanisms, loader logic, and staging infrastructure.”

The campaign exploits developers’ trust in shared code, gaining persistence within high-value developer systems that often contain source code, environment secrets, credentials, and access to build or cloud infrastructure.

Multiple triggers for remote control

Microsoft researchers found that the malicious repositories were engineered with redundancy, offering several execution paths that ultimately result in the same backdoor behavior.

In some cases, simply opening the project in Visual Studio Code was enough. The attackers abused workspace automation by embedding tasks configured to run automatically when a folder is opened and trusted. This causes code execution without the developer running anything.

Other variants rely on build processes or server startup routines, ensuring that the malicious code runs when developers perform typical actions such as launching a development server. Regardless of the trigger, the repositories retrieve additional JavaScripts from remote infrastructure and execute it in memory, reducing traces on disk.

The retrieved payload operates in stages. An initial registration component identifies the host and can deliver bootstrap instructions, after which a separate C2 controller provides persistence and enables follow-on actions such as payload delivery and data exfiltration.

Infection through a fake “coding test”

Microsoft said the investigation started with analyzing the suspicious outbound connections from Node.js processes communicating with attacker-controlled servers. Correlating network activity with process telemetry led analysts back to the original infection through recruiting exercises.

One of the repositories was hosted on Bitbucket and presented as a technical assessment, along with a related repository using the Cryptan-Platform-MVP1 naming convention. “Multiple repositories followed repeatable naming conventions and project ‘family’ patterns, enabling targeted searches for additional related repositories that were not directly referenced in observed telemetry but exhibited the same execution and staging behavior,” Microsoft wrote.

When an infection is suspected, Microsoft warns that affected organizations must immediately contain suspected endpoints, trace the initiating process tree, and hunt for repeated polling to suspicious infrastructure across the fleet. Because credential and session theft may follow, responders should evaluate identity risk, revoke sessions, and restrict high-risk SaaS actions to limit exposure during investigation.

Long-term mitigations include a focus on tightening developer trust boundaries and reducing execution risk, Microsoft added. Other recommendations include enforcing Visual Studio Code Workspace Trust defaults, applying attack surface reduction rules, enabling cloud-based reputation protections, and strengthening conditional access.

The man stole identities from hundreds of people and used them to give North Korean IT workers remote jobs.

A Ukrainian man has been sentenced to five years in prison after helping North Korean IT workers infiltrate American companies using stolen identities, reports Bleepingcomputer.

The 39-year-old man from Kiev pleaded guilty in November 2025 to charges including aggravated identity theft and conspiracy to commit fraud. He has also agreed to surrender assets worth over $1.4 million, including cash and cryptocurrency.

According to US authorities, he stole identities from hundreds of people, including US citizens, and sold them to foreign IT workers who used them to obtain remote jobs at around 40 companies in the US.

The 39-year-old is also said to have provided hundreds of so-called proxy identities and accounts on freelance platforms, as well as helping to run several laptop farms in different countries. The arrangement made it appear as if the computers and workers were located in the US, even though they were actually working from abroad.
