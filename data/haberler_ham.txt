The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has warned of an increase in ATM jackpotting incidents across the country, leading to losses of more than $20 million in 2025.

The agency said 1,900 ATM jackpotting incidents have been reported since 2020, out of which 700 took place last year. In December 2025, the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) said about $40.73 million has been collectively lost to jackpotting attacks since 2021.

"Threat actors exploit physical and software vulnerabilities in ATMs and deploy malware to dispense cash without a legitimate transaction," the FBI said in a Thursday bulletin.

The jackpotting attacks involve the use of specialized malware, such as Ploutus, to infect ATMs and force them to dispense cash. In most cases, cybercriminals have been observed gaining unauthorized access to the machines by opening an ATM face with widely available generic keys.

There are at least two different ways by which the malware is deployed: Removing the ATM's hard drive, followed by either connecting it to their computer, copying it to the hard drive, attaching it back to the ATM, and rebooting the ATM, or replacing it entirely with a foreign hard drive preloaded with the malware and rebooting it.

Regardless of the method used, the end result is the same. The malware is designed to interact directly with the ATM hardware, thereby getting around any security controls present in the original ATM software.

Because the malware does not require a connection to an actual bank card or customer account to dispense cash, it can be used against ATMs of different manufacturers with little to no code changes, as the underlying Windows operating system is exploited during the attack.

Ploutus was first observed in Mexico in 2013. Once installed, it grants threat actors complete control over an ATM, enabling them to trigger cash-outs that the FBI said can occur in minutes and are harder to detect until after the money is withdrawn.

"Ploutus malware exploits the eXtensions for Financial Services (XFS), the layer of software that instructs an ATM what to physically do," the FBI explained.

"When a legitimate transaction occurs, the ATM application sends instructions through XFS for bank authorization. If a threat actor can issue their own commands to XFS, they can bypass bank authorization entirely and instruct the ATM to dispense cash on demand."

The agency has outlined a long list of recommendations that organizations can adopt to mitigate jackpotting risks. This includes tightening physical security by installing threat sensors, setting up security cameras, and changing standard locks on ATM devices.

Other measures involve auditing ATM devices, changing default credentials, configuring an automatic shutdown mode once indicators of compromise are detected, enforcing device allowlisting to prevent connection of unauthorized devices, and maintaining logs.

Two former Google engineers and one of their husbands have been indicted in the U.S. for allegedly committing trade secret theft from the search giant and other tech firms and transferring the information to unauthorized locations, including Iran.

Samaneh Ghandali, 41, and her husband Mohammadjavad Khosravi (aka Mohammad Khosravi), 40, along with her sister Soroor Ghandali, 32, have been accused of conspiring to commit trade secret theft from Google and other leading technology companies, theft and attempted theft of trade secrets, and obstruction of justice.

The three defendants, all Iranian nationals and residing in San Jose, were arrested on Thursday and made their initial appearances in federal district court in the California city.

According to the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ), the Ghandali sisters worked at Google before joining another technology company identified as Company 3. Khosravi is said to have been employed at a different company (named Company 2). All three of them landed jobs in the area of mobile computer processors.

"As part of the alleged scheme to commit trade secret theft, the defendants used their employment to obtain access to confidential and sensitive information," the DoJ said in a press release.

"The defendants then exfiltrated confidential and sensitive documents, including trade secrets related to processor security and cryptography and other technologies, from Google and other technology companies to unauthorized third-party and personal locations, including to work devices associated with each other's employers, and to Iran."

In a statement shared with Bloomberg, a Google spokesperson said the company has enhanced safeguards to protect its confidential information and immediately alerted law enforcement after discovering the incident. The trade secrets pertained to the company's Tensor processor for Pixel phones.

Samaneh Ghandali, per the department, transferred hundreds of files, including Google trade secrets, to a third-party communications platform, specifically to channels that had each of the defendant's first names. Soroor Ghandali is also alleged to have exfiltrated numerous Google-related files, which contained trade secrets, to the same channels while working for the company.

The trade secret files were subsequently copied to different personal devices, as well as a work device belonging to Khosravi and a work device issued to Soroor Ghandali by Company 3. The defendants then concealed their actions by submitting false, signed affidavits; destroyed the exfiltrated files from electronic devices; and manually took photographs of screens containing the documents’ contents instead of transferring the documents using the messaging app.

"After Google's internal security systems detected Samaneh Ghandali's activity and Google revoked her access to company resources in August 2023, Samaneh Ghandali allegedly executed a signed affidavit claiming she had not shared Google's confidential information with anyone outside the company," the DoJ added.

Furthermore, Samaneh Ghandali and Khosravi performed searches online and visited websites about deleting communications and other data. This included queries related to the duration for which a cellular service provider kept "messages to print out for court."

In the meantime, the couple is alleged to have continued accessing Google trade secrets stored on their personal devices for purposes of manually photographing hundreds of computer screens of both Google's and Company 2's sensitive information for an unspecified duration that stretched for months.

Samaneh Ghandali also allegedly manually captured with her mobile phone about 24 photographs of Khosravi's work computer screen containing Company 2 trade secret information on the night before the pair traveled to Iran in December 2023. These photographs were then accessed from a personal device associated with Samaneh Ghandali in Iran.

If convicted, each defendant faces a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine for each count of trade secret theft charges and a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine for the count of obstruction of justice.

The development comes less than a month after another ex-Google engineer, Linwei Ding, was convicted in the U.S. for stealing thousands of the company's confidential documents to build a startup in China.

[3] The Hacker News - PromptSpy Android Malware Abuses Gemini AI to Automate Recent-Apps Persistence
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Thu, 19 Feb 2026 23:22:00 +0530

[TAM METİN - 717 kelime]
Cybersecurity researchers have discovered what they say is the first Android malware that abuses Gemini, Google's generative artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot, as part of its execution flow and achieves persistence.

The malware has been codenamed PromptSpy by ESET. The malware is equipped to capture lockscreen data, block uninstallation efforts, gather device information, take screenshots, and record screen activity as video.

"Gemini is used to analyze the current screen and provide PromptSpy with step-by-step instructions on how to ensure the malicious app remains pinned in the recent apps list, thus preventing it from being easily swiped away or killed by the system," ESET researcher Lukáš Štefanko said in a report published today.

"Since Android malware often relies on UI navigation, leveraging generative AI enables the threat actors to adapt to more or less any device, layout, or OS version, which can greatly expand the pool of potential victims."

Specifically, this involves hard-coding the AI model and a prompt in the malware, assigning the AI agent the persona of an "Android automation assistant." It sends Gemini a natural language prompt along with an XML dump of the current screen that gives detailed information about every UI element, including its text, type, and exact position on the display.

Gemini then processes this information and responds with JSON instructions that tell the malware what action to perform (e.g., a tap) and where to perform it. The multi-step interaction continues until the app is successfully locked in the recent apps list and cannot be terminated.

The main goal of PromptSpy is to deploy a built-in VNC module that grants the attackers remote access to the victim's device. The malware is also designed to take advantage of Android's accessibility services to prevent it from being uninstalled using invisible overlays. It communicates with a hard-coded command-and-control (C2) server ("54.67.2[.]84") via the VNC protocol.

It's worth noting that the actions suggested by Gemini are executed through accessibility services, allowing the malware to interact with the device without user input. All of this is accomplished by communicating with the C2 server to receive the Gemini API key, take screenshots on demand, intercept lockscreen PIN or password, record screen, and capture the pattern unlock screen as a video.

An analysis of the language localization clues and the distribution vectors used suggests that the campaign is likely financially motivated and targets users in Argentina. Interestingly, evidence shows that PromptSpy was developed in a Chinese‑speaking environment, as indicated by the presence of debug strings written in simplified Chinese.

"PromptSpy is distributed by a dedicated website and has never been available on Google Play," Štefanko said.

PromptSpy is assessed to be an advanced version of another previously unknown Android malware called VNCSpy, samples of which were first uploaded to the VirusTotal platform last month from Hong Kong.

The website, "mgardownload[.]com," is used to deliver a dropper, which, when installed and launched, opens a web page hosted on "m-mgarg[.]com." It masquerades as JPMorgan Chase, going by the name "MorganArg" in reference to Morgan Argentina. The dropper also instructs victims to grant it permissions to install apps from unknown sources to deploy PromptSpy.

"In the background, the Trojan contacts its server to request a configuration file, which includes a link to download another APK, presented to the victim, in Spanish, as an update," ESET said. "During our research, the configuration server was no longer accessible, so the exact download URL remains unknown."

The findings illustrate how threat actors are incorporating AI tools into their operations and make malware more dynamic, giving them ways to automate actions that would otherwise be more challenging with conventional approaches.

Because PromptSpy prevents itself from being uninstalled by overlaying invisible elements on the screen, the only way for a victim to remove it is to reboot the device into Safe Mode, where third‑party apps are disabled and can be uninstalled.

"PromptSpy shows that Android malware is beginning to evolve in a sinister way," ESET said. "By relying on generative AI to interpret on‑screen elements and decide how to interact with them, the malware can adapt to virtually any device, screen size, or UI layout it encounters."

"Instead of hardcoded taps, it simply hands AI a snapshot of the screen and receives precise, step‑by‑step interaction instructions in return, helping it achieve a persistence technique resistant to UI changes."

[TAM METİN - 466 kelime]
An international cybercrime operation against online scams has led to 651 arrests and recovered more than $4.3 million as part of an effort led by law enforcement agencies from 16 African countries.

The initiative, codenamed Operation Red Card 2.0, took place between December 8, 2025 and January 30, 2026, according to INTERPOL. It targeted infrastructure and actors behind high-yield investment scams, mobile money fraud, and fraudulent mobile loan applications.

Countries that participated in the law enforcement operation included Angola, Benin, Cameroon, Côte d’Ivoire, Chad, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Kenya, Namibia, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. It was conducted under the African Joint Operation against Cybercrime (AFJOC).

"During the eight-week operation, investigations exposed scams linked to over USD 45 million in financial losses and identified 1,247 victims, predominantly from the African continent but also from other regions of the world," INTERPOL said in a press release.

The operation also saw authorities confiscating 2,341 devices and taking down 1,442 malicious IPs, domains, and servers, as well as other related infrastructure. Some of the notable cases are listed below -

Nigerian authorities dismantled a high-yield investment fraud ring that recruited young individuals to carry out cyber-enabled crimes using phishing, identity theft, social engineering, and fake digital asset investment schemes. More than 1,000 fraudulent social media accounts were taken down.

Six members of a sophisticated cybercrime syndicate were arrested by Nigerian authorities for breaching the internal platform of a major telecommunications provider through compromised staff login credentials. The scheme involved stealing "significant volumes of airtime and data for illegal resale."

Kenyan authorities arrested 27 individuals in connection with a fraud scheme that used messaging apps, social media, and fictitious testimonials to deceive victims into making fake investments by promising them huge returns. Victims were shown bogus account statements or dashboards to keep up the ruse, but were blocked from making any withdrawals.

Côte d'Ivoire authorities arrested 58 individuals and seized 240 mobile phones, 25 laptops and over 300 SIM cards to disrupt a predatory mobile loan fraud scheme that primarily targeted vulnerable populations through fake mobile applications and messaging services, enticing them with promises of unsecured loans and then trapping them extra fees, abusive debt-collection practices, and theft of sensitive personal and financial data.

"These organized cybercriminal syndicates inflict devastating financial and psychological harm on individuals, businesses, and entire communities with their false promises," Neal Jetton, INTERPOL's director of the Cybercrime Directorate, said.

"Operation Red Card highlights the importance of collaboration when combating transnational cybercrime. I encourage all victims of cybercrime to reach out to law enforcement for help."

The second phase of Red Card comes almost a year after INTERPOL announced the arrest of 306 suspects and seizure of 1,842 devices as part of the first wave of the operation that transpired between November 2024 and February 2025.

Microsoft has disclosed a now-patched security flaw in Windows Admin Center that could allow an attacker to escalate their privileges.

Windows Admin Center is a locally deployed, browser-based management tool set that lets users manage their Windows Clients, Servers, and Clusters without the need for connecting to the cloud.

The high-severity vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2026-26119, carries a CVSS score of 8.8 out of a maximum of 10.0

"Improper authentication in Windows Admin Center allows an authorized attacker to elevate privileges over a network," Microsoft said in an advisory released on February 17, 2026. "The attacker would gain the rights of the user that is running the affected application."

Microsoft credited Semperis researcher Andrea Pierini with discovering and reporting the vulnerability. It's worth mentioning that the security issue was patched by the tech giant in Windows Admin Center version 2511 released in December 2025.

While the Windows maker makes no mention of this vulnerability being exploited in the wild, it has been tagged with an "Exploitation More Likely" assessment.

Technical details related to CVE-2026-26119 are presently under wraps, but that could change soon. In a post shared on LinkedIn, Pierini said the vulnerability could "allow a full domain compromise starting from a standard user" under certain conditions.

This edition of ThreatsDay Bulletin brings those signals into one place. Scan through the roundup for quick, clear updates on what’s unfolding across the cybersecurity and hacking landscape.

Privacy model hardening

Google Showcases New Privacy and Security Features in Android 17


      Google announced the first beta version of Android 17, with two privacy and security enhancements: the deprecation of Cleartext Traffic Attribute and support for HPKE Hybrid Cryptography to enable secure communication using a combination of public key and symmetric encryption (AEAD). "If your app targets (Android 17) or higher and relies on usesCleartextTraffic='true' without a corresponding Network Security Configuration, it will default to disallowing cleartext traffic," Google said. "You are encouraged to migrate to Network Security Configuration files for granular control."

RaaS expands cross-platform reach

LockBit 5.0 Ransomware Analyzed


      A new analysis of the LockBit 5.0 ransomware has revealed that the Windows version packs in various defense evasion and anti-analysis techniques, including packing, DLL unhooking, process hollowing, patching Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) functions, and log clearing. "What's notable among the multiple systems support is its proclaimed capability to 'work on all versions of Proxmox,'" Acronis said. "Proxmox is an open-source virtualization platform and is being adopted by enterprises as an alternative to commercial hypervisors, which makes it another prime target of ransomware attacks." The latest version also introduces dedicated builds tailored for enterprise environments, highlighting the continued evolution of ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operations.

Mac users lured via nested obfuscation

ClickFix Continues to Evolve


      Cybersecurity researchers have detailed a new evolution of the ClickFix social engineering tactic targeting macOS users. "Dubbed Matryoshka due to its nested obfuscation layers, this variant uses a fake installation/fix flow to trick victims into executing a malicious Terminal command," Intego said. "While the ClickFix tactic is not new, this campaign introduces stronger evasion techniques — including an in-memory, compressed wrapper and API-gated network communications — designed to hinder static analysis and automated sandboxes." The campaign primarily targets users attempting to visit software review sites, leveraging typosquatting in the URL name to redirect them to fake sites and activate the infection chain.

Loader pipeline drives rapid domain takeover

ClickFix Delivers Matanbuchus 3.0 and AstarionRAT


      Another new ClickFix campaign detected in February 2026 has been observed delivering a malware-as-a-service (MaaS) loader known as Matanbuchus 3.0. Huntress, which dissected the attack chain, said the ultimate objective of the intrusion was to deploy ransomware or exfiltrate data based on the fact that the threat actor rapidly progressed from initial access to lateral movement to domain controllers via PsExec, rogue account creation, and Microsoft Defender exclusion staging. The attack also led to the deployment of a custom implant dubbed AstarionRAT that supports 24 commands to facilitate credential theft, SOCKS5 proxy, port scanning, reflective code loading, and shell execution. According to data from the cybersecurity company, ClickFix fueled 53% of all malware loader activity in 2025.

Typosquat chain targets macOS credentials

Fake Homebrew Typosquats Deliver Cuckoo Stealer


      In yet another ClickFix campaign, threat actors are relying on the "reliable trick" to host malicious instructions on fake websites disguised as Homebrew ("homabrews[.]org") to trick users into pasting them on the Terminal app under the pretext of installing the macOS package manager. In the attack chain documented by Hunt.io, the commands in the typosquatted Homebrew domain are used to deliver a credential-harvesting loader and a second-stage macOS infostealer dubbed Cuckoo Stealer. "The injected installer looped on password prompts using 'dscl . -authonly,' ensuring the attacker obtained working credentials before deploying the second stage," Hunt.io said. "Cuckoo Stealer is a full-featured macOS infostealer and RAT: It establishes LaunchAgent persistence, removes quarantine attributes, and maintains encrypted HTTPS command-and-control communications. It collects browser credentials, session tokens, macOS Keychain data, Apple Notes, messaging sessions, VPN and FTP configurations, and over 20 cryptocurrency wallet applications." The use of "dscl . -authonly" has been previously observed in attacks deploying Atomic Stealer.

Phobos affiliate detained in Europe

Poland Detains Man with Alleged Links to Phobos Ransomware


      Authorities from Poland's Central Bureau for Combating Cybercrime (CBZC) have detained a 47-year-old man over suspected ties to the Phobos ransomware group. He faces a potential prison sentence of up to five years. The CBZC said the "47-year-old used encrypted messaging to contact the Phobos criminal group, known for conducting ransomware attacks," adding the suspect's devices contained logins, passwords, credit card numbers, and server IP addresses that could have been used to launch "various attacks, including ransomware." The arrest is part of Europol's Operation Aether, which targets the 8Base ransomware group, believed to be linked to Phobos. It has been almost exactly a year since international law enforcement dismantled the 8Base crew. More than 1,000 organizations around the world have been targeted in Phobos ransomware attacks, and the cybercriminals are believed to have obtained over $16 million in ransom payments.

Industrial ransomware surge accelerates

Rise in Attacks Targeting Operational Technology Environments


      There has been a sharp rise in the number of ransomware groups targeting industrial organizations as cybercriminals continue to exploit vulnerabilities in operational technology (OT) and industrial control systems (ICS), Dragos warned. A total of 119 ransomware groups targeting industrial organizations were tracked during 2025, a 49% increase from the 80 tracked in 2024. 2025 saw 3,300 industrial organizations around the world hit by ransomware, compared with 1693 in 2024. The most targeted sector was manufacturing, followed by transportation. In addition, a hacking group tracked as Pyroxene has been observed conducting "supply chain-leveraged attacks targeting defense, critical infrastructure, and industrial sectors, with operations expanding from the Middle East into North America and Western Europe." It often leverages initial access provided by PARISITE, to enable movement from IT into OT networks. Pyroxene overlaps with activity attributed to Imperial Kitten (aka APT35), a threat actor affiliated with the cyber arm of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).

Copilot bypassed DLP safeguards

Microsoft Says a Copilot Bug Summarised Confidential Emails


      Microsoft confirmed a bug (CW1226324) that let Microsoft 365 Copilot summarize confidential emails from Sent Items and Drafts folders since January 21, 2026, without users' permission, bypassing data loss prevention (DLP) policies put in place to safeguard sensitive data. A fix was deployed by the company on February 3, 2026. However, the company did not disclose how many users or organizations were affected. "Users' email messages with a confidential label applied are being incorrectly processed by Microsoft 365 Copilot chat," Microsoft said. "The Microsoft 365 Copilot "work tab" Chat is summarizing email messages even though these email messages have a sensitivity label applied, and a DLP policy is configured. A code issue is allowing items in the sent items and draft folders to be picked up by Copilot even though confidential labels are set in place."

Jira trials weaponized for spam

Atlassian Jira Exploited in Spam Campaigns


      Threat actors are abusing the trust and reputation associated with Atlassian Jira Cloud and its connected email system to run automated spam campaigns and bypass traditional email security. To accomplish this, the operators created Atlassian Cloud trial accounts using randomized naming conventions, allowing them to generate disposable Jira Cloud instances at scale. "Emails were tailored to target specific language groups, targeting English, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, and Russian speakers — including highly skilled Russian professionals living abroad," Trend Micro said. "These campaigns not only distributed generic spam, but also specifically targeted sectors such as government and corporate entities." The attacks, active from late December 2025 through late January 2026, primarily targeted organizations using Atlassian Jira. The goal was to get recipients to open the emails and click on malicious links, which would initiate a redirect chain powered by the Keitaro Traffic Distribution System (TDS) and then finally lead them to pages peddling investment scams and online casino landing sites, suggesting that financial gain was likely the main objective.

"These campaigns not only distributed generic spam, but also specifically targeted sectors such as government and corporate entities." The attacks, active from late December 2025 through late January 2026, primarily targeted organizations using Atlassian Jira. The goal was to get recipients to open the emails and click on malicious links, which would initiate a redirect chain powered by the Keitaro Traffic Distribution System (TDS) and then finally lead them to pages peddling investment scams and online casino landing sites, suggesting that financial gain was likely the main objective.

GitLab SSRF now federally mandated patch

CISA Adds GitLab Flaw to KEV Catalog


      The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), on February 18, 2026, added CVE-2021-22175 to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, requiring Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to apply the patch by March 11, 2026. "GitLab contains a server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability when requests to the internal network for webhooks are enabled," CISA said. In March 2025, GreyNoise revealed that a cluster of about 400 IP addresses was actively exploiting multiple SSRF vulnerabilities, including CVE-2021-22175, to target susceptible instances in the U.S., Germany, Singapore, India, Lithuania, and Japan.

Telegram bots fuel Fortune 500 phishing

GS7 Targets Fortune 500 Firms in Phishing Campaign


      An elusive, financially motivated threat actor dubbed GS7 has been targeting Fortune 500 companies in a new phishing campaign that leverages trusted company branding with lookalike websites aimed at harvesting credentials via Telegram bots. The campaign, codenamed Operation DoppelBrand, targets top financial institutions, including Wells Fargo, USAA, Navy Federal Credit Union, Fidelity Investments, and Citibank, as well as technology, healthcare, and telecommunications firms worldwide. Victims are lured through phishing emails and redirected to counterfeit pages where credentials are harvested and transmitted to Telegram bots controlled by the attacker. According to SOCRadar, the group itself, however, has a history stretching back to 2022. The threat actor is said to have registered more than 150 malicious domains in recent months using registrars such as NameCheap and OwnRegistrar, and routing traffic through Cloudflare to evade detection. GS7's end goals include not only harvesting credentials, but also downloading remote management and monitoring (RMM) tools like LogMeIn Resolve on victim systems to enable remote access or the deployment of malware. This has raised the possibility that the group may even act as an initial access broker (IAB), selling the access to ransomware groups or other affiliates.

Remcos shifts to live C2 surveillance

New Remcos RAT Variant Spotted


      Phishing emails disguised as invoices, job offers, or government notices are being used to distribute a new variant of Remcos RAT to facilitate comprehensive surveillance and control over infected systems. "The latest Remcos variant has been observed exhibiting a significant change in behaviour compared to previous versions," Point Wild said. "Instead of stealing and storing data locally on the infected system, this variant establishes direct online command-and-control (C2) communication, enabling real-time access and control. In particular, it leverages the webcam to capture live video streams, allowing attackers to monitor targets remotely. This shift from local data exfiltration to live, online surveillance represents an evolution in Remcos’ capabilities, increasing the risk of immediate espionage and persistent monitoring."

China-made vehicles restricted on bases

Poland Bans Camera-Packing Cars Made in China From Military Facilities


      Poland's Ministry of Defence has banned Chinese cars, and other motor vehicles equipped with technology to record position, images, or sound, from entering protected military facilities due to national security concerns and to "limit the risk of access to sensitive data." The ban also extends to connecting work phones to infotainment systems in motor vehicles produced in China. The ban isn't permanent: the Defence Ministry has called for the development of a vetting process to allow carmakers to undergo a security assessment that, if passed, can allow their vehicles to enter protected facilities. "Modern vehicles equipped with advanced communication systems and sensors can collect and transmit data, so their presence in protected zones requires appropriate safety regulations," the Polish Army said. The measures introduced are preventive and comply with the practices of NATO countries and other allies to ensure the highest standards of defense infrastructure protection. They are part of a wider process of adapting security procedures to the changing technological environment and current requirements for the protection of critical infrastructure."

DKIM replay fuels invoice scams

Phishing Attacks Abuse Legitimate Apple and PayPal Invoices


      Bad actors are abusing legitimate invoices and dispute notifications from trusted vendors, such as PayPal, Apple, DocuSign, and Dropbox Sign (formerly HelloSign), to bypass email security controls. "These platforms often allow users to enter a 'seller name' or add a custom note when creating an invoice or notification," Casey-owned INKY said. "Attackers abuse this functionality by inserting scam instructions and a phone number into those user-controlled fields. They then send the resulting invoice or dispute notice to an email address they control, ensuring the malicious content is embedded in a legitimate, vendor-generated message." Because these emails originate from a legitimate company, they bypass checks like Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance (DMARC). As soon as the legitimate email is received, the attacker proceeds to forward it to the intended targets, allowing the "authentic looking" message to land in the victims' inboxes. The attack is known as a DKIM replay attack.

RMM abuse surges 277%

Adversaries Drop Malware in Favor of RMM


      A new report from Huntress has revealed that the abuse of Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM) software surged 277% year-over-year, accounting for 24% of all observed incidents. Threat actors have begun to increasingly favor these tools because they are ubiquitous in enterprise environments, and the trusted nature of the RMM software allows malicious activity to blend in with legitimate usage, making detection harder for defenders. They also offer increased stealth, persistence, and operational efficiency. "As cybercriminals built entire playbooks around these legitimate, trusted tools to drop malware, steal credentials, and execute commands, the use of traditional hacking tools plummeted by 53%, while remote access trojans and malicious scripts dropped by 20% and 11.7%, respectively," the company said.

Texas targets China-linked tech firms

Texas sues TP-Link and Anzu Robotics over China Links


      Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has sued TP-Link for "deceptively marketing its networking devices and allowing the Chinese Communist Party ('CCP') to access American consumers' devices in their homes." Paxton's lawsuit alleges that TP Link's products have been used by Chinese hacking groups to launch cyber attacks against the U.S. and that the company is subject to Chinese data laws, which it said require firms operating in the country to support its intelligence services by "divulging Americans' data." TP-Link told The Record that these allegations are "without merit" and that neither the Chinese government nor the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) exercises control over the company, its products, or user data. It also added that all U.S. user data is stored on domestic Amazon Web Services (AWS) servers. In a second lawsuit, Paxton also accused Anzu Robotics of misleading Texas consumers about the "origin, data practices, and security risks of its drones." Paxton's office described the company's products as "21st century Trojan horse linked to the CCP."

MetaMask backdoor expands DPRK campaign

Contagious Interview Campaign Evolves


      The North Korea-linked campaign known as Contagious Interview is designed to target IT professionals working in cryptocurrency, Web3, and artificial intelligence sectors to steal sensitive data and financial information using malware such as BeaverTail and InvisibleFerret. However, recent iterations of the campaign have expanded their data theft capabilities by tampering with the MetaMask wallet extension (if it's installed) through a lightweight JavaScript backdoor that shares the same functionality as InvisibleFerret, according to security researcher Seongsu Park. "Through the backdoor, attackers instruct the infected system to download and install a fake version of the popular MetaMask cryptocurrency wallet extension, complete with a dynamically generated configuration file that makes it appear legitimate," Park said. "Once installed, the compromised MetaMask extension silently captures the victim's wallet unlock password and transmits it to the attackers’ command-and-control server, giving them complete access to cryptocurrency funds."

Booking.com kits hit hotels, guests

Hotel and Retail Sector Ensnared in Booking.com Phishing Campaign


      Bridewell has warned of a resurgence in malicious activity targeting the hotel and retail sector. "The primary motivation driving this incident is financial fraud, targeting two victims: hotel businesses and hotel customers, in sequential order," security researcher Joshua Penny said. "The threat actor(s) utilize impersonation of the Booking.com platform through two distinct phishing kits dedicated to harvesting credentials and banking information from each victim, respectively." It's worth noting that the activity shares overlap with a prior activity wave disclosed by Sekoia in November 2025, although the use of a dedicated phishing kit is a new approach by either the same or new operators.

EPMM exploits enable persistent access

Ivanti Flaws Exploited to Drop Reverse Shells and Malware


      The recently disclosed security flaws in Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile (EPMM) have been exploited by bad actors to establish a reverse shell, deliver JSP web shells, conduct reconnaissance, and download malware, including Nezha, cryptocurrency miners, and backdoors for remote access. The two critical vulnerabilities, CVE-2026-1281 and CVE-2026-1340, allow unauthenticated attackers to remotely execute arbitrary code on target servers, granting them full control over mobile device management (MDM) infrastructure without requiring user interaction or credentials. According to Palo Alto Networks Unit 42, the campaign has affected state and local government, healthcare, manufacturing, professional and legal services, and high technology sectors in the U.S., Germany, Australia, and Canada. "Threat actors are accelerating operations, moving from initial reconnaissance to deploying dormant backdoors designed to maintain long-term access even after organizations apply patches," the cybersecurity company said. In a related development, Germany's Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) has reported evidence of exploitation since the summer of 2025 and has urged organizations to audit their systems for indicators of compromise (IoCs) as far back as July 2025.

AI passwords lack true randomness

LLM-Generated Passwords Are Dangerously Insecure


      New research by Irregular has found that passwords generated directly by a large language model (LLM) may appear strong but are fundamentally insecure, as "LLMs are designed to predict tokens – the opposite of securely and uniformly sampling random characters." The artificial intelligence (AI) security company said it detected LLM-generated passwords in the real world as part of code development tasks instead of leaning on traditional secure password generation methods. "People and coding agents should not rely on LLMs to generate passwords," the company said. "LLMs are optimized to produce predictable, plausible outputs, which is incompatible with secure password generation. AI coding agents should be directed to use secure password generation methods instead of relying on LLM-output passwords. Developers using AI coding assistants should review generated code for hardcoded credentials and ensure agents use cryptographically secure methods or established password managers."

PDF engine flaws enable account takeover

16 Vulnerabilities in Foxit and Apryse PDF Tools


      Cybersecurity researchers have discovered more than a dozen vulnerabilities (CVE-2025-70401, CVE-2025-70402, and CVE-2025-66500) in popular PDF platforms from Foxit and Apryse, potentially allowing attackers to exploit them for account takeover, session hijacking, data exfiltration, and arbitrary JavaScript execution. "Rather than isolated bugs, the issues cluster around recurring architectural failures in how PDF platforms handle untrusted input across layers," Novee Security researchers Lidor Ben Shitrit, Elad Meged, and Avishai Fradlis said. "Several vulnerabilities were exploitable with a single request and affected trusted domains commonly embedded inside enterprise applications." The issues have been addressed by both Apryse and Foxit through product updates.

Training labs expose cloud backdoors

Exposed Training Apps Turn Backdoors for Cloud Breaches


      A "widespread" security issue has been discovered where security vendors inadvertently expose deliberately vulnerable training applications, such as OWASP Juice Shop, DVWA, bWAPP, and Hackazon, to the public internet. This can open organizations to severe security risks when they are executed from a privileged cloud account. "Primarily deployed for internal testing, product demonstrations, and security training, these applications were frequently left accessible in their default or misconfigured states," Pentera Labs said. "These critical flaws not only allowed attackers full control over the compromised compute engine but also provided pathways for lateral movement into sensitive internal systems. Violations of the principle of least privilege and inadequate sandboxing measures further facilitated privilege escalation, endangering critical infrastructure and sensitive organizational data." Further analysis has determined that threat actors are exploiting this blind spot to plant web shells, cryptocurrency miners, and persistence mechanisms on compromised systems.

Evasion loader refines C2 stealth

Oyster Loader Detailed


      The malware loader known as Oyster (aka Broomstick or CleanUpLoader) has continued to evolve into early 2026, fine-tuning its C2 infrastructure and obfuscation methods, per findings from Sekoia. The malware is distributed mainly through fake websites that distribute installers for legitimate software like Microsoft Teams, with the core payload often deployed as a DLL for persistent execution. "The initial stage leverages excessive legitimate API call hammering and simple anti-debugging traps to thwart static analysis," the company said. "The core payload is delivered in a highly obfuscated manner. The final stage implements a robust C2 communication protocol that features a dual-layer server infrastructure and highly-customized data encoding."

Stealer taunts researchers in code

Noodlophile Operators Hit Back


Noodlophile is the name given to an information-stealing malware that has been distributed via fake AI tools promoted on Facebook. Assessed to be the work of a threat actor based in Vietnam, it was first documented by Morphisec in May 2025. Since then, there have been other reports detailing various campaigns, such as UNC6229 and PXA Stealer, orchestrated by Vietnamese cybercriminals. Morphisec's latest analysis of Noodlophile has revealed that the threat actor "padded the malware with millions of repeats of a colorful Vietnamese phrase translating to 'f*** you, Morphisec,'" suggesting that the operators were not thrilled about getting exposed. "Not just to vent frustration over disrupted campaigns, but also to bloat the file and crash AI-based analysis tools that are based on the Python disassemble library – dis.dis(obj)," security researcher Michael Gorelik said.

Crypto library RCE risk patched

OpenSSL Fixes Several Flaws


      The OpenSSL project has patched a stack buffer overflow flaw that can lead to remote code execution attacks under certain conditions. The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-15467, resides in how the library processes Cryptographic Message Syntax data. Threat actors can use CMS packets with maliciously crafted AEAD parameters to crash OpenSSL and run malicious code. CVE-2025-15467 is one of 12 issues that were disclosed by AISLE late last month. Another high-severity vulnerability is CVE-2025-11187, which could trigger a stack-based buffer overflow due to a missing validation.

Machine accounts expand delegation risk

Kerberos Delegation Applies to Computer Accounts


      New research from Silverfort has cleared a "common assumption" that Kerberos delegation -- which allows a service to request resources or perform actions on behalf of a user -- applies not just to human users, but also to machine accounts as well. In other words, a computer account can be delegated on behalf of highly privileged machine identities such as domain controllers. "That means a service trusted for delegation can act not just on behalf of other users, but also on behalf of machine accounts, the most critical non-human identities (NHIs) in any domain," Silverfort researcher Dor Segal said. "The risk is obvious. If an adversary can leverage delegation, it can act on behalf of sensitive machine accounts, which in many environments hold privileges equivalent to Domain Administrator." To counter the risk, it's advised to run "Set-ADAccountControl -Identity “HOST01$” -AccountNotDelegated $true" for each sensitive machine account.

[7] BleepingComputer - Ukrainian gets 5 years for helping North Koreans infiltrate US firms

[TAM METİN - 547 kelime]
A Ukrainian national was sentenced to five years in prison for providing North Korean IT workers with stolen identities that helped them infiltrate U.S. companies.

39-year-old Oleksandr Didenko of Kyiv, Ukraine, pleaded guilty in November 2025 to aggravated identity theft and wire fraud conspiracy after being arrested in Poland in May 2024.

This week, he was sentenced to 60 months in prison and 12 months of supervised release, and agreed to forfeit more than $1.4 million, including cash and cryptocurrency seized from Didenko and his accomplices.

"Oleksandr Didenko participated in a scheme that stole the identities of hundreds of people, to include United States citizens, which were used by North Korea to fraudulently secure lucrative IT jobs," said James Barnacle, Assistant Director in Charge of the FBI's New York Field Office. "This massive operation not only created an unauthorized backdoor into our country's job market, but helped fund the regime of an adversary."

According to court documents, Didenko stole U.S. citizens' identities and sold them to overseas IT workers through an online platform known as UpWorkSell (which was seized by the Justice Department), who used them to fraudulently secure jobs with 40 U.S. companies in California and Pennsylvania.

Throughout this scheme, he provided the North Korean remote workers with at least 871 proxy identities and proxy accounts on three freelance IT hiring platforms. He also facilitated the operation of at least eight "laptop farms" in Virginia, Tennessee, California, Florida, Ecuador, Poland, and Ukraine that allowed the North Koreans to make it look like their devices were located in the United States.

One of these "laptop farms" was run by Christina Marie Chapman, a 50-year-old woman from Arizona, from her own home between October 2020 and October 2023. Chapman was charged in May 2024 and was sentenced to 102 months in prison after a July 2025 guilty plea.

The FBI has been warning about the danger presented by North Korean threat actors impersonating U.S.-based IT staff since at least 2023. As the law enforcement agency repeatedly noted, North Korea maintains a large and well-organized army of IT workers who use stolen identities to secure employment with hundreds of American companies.

In July 2024, U.S. authorities sanctioned, charged, or indicted 20 individuals and 8 companies across three separate enforcement waves. These actions were followed by a fourth wave of sanctions in August 2025 that targeted companies associated with North Korean IT worker schemes operated by Russian and Chinese nationals.

More recently, in December 2025, security researchers revealed that Famous Chollima (or WageMole) operatives, part of the notorious North Korean state-backed Lazarus hacking group, tricked recruiters using AI tools and stolen identities and got hired by Fortune 500 companies.

Researchers have discovered the first known Android malware to use generative AI in its execution flow, using Google’s Gemini model to adapt its persistence across different devices.

In a report today, ESET researcher Lukas Stefanko explains how a new Android malware family named "PromptSpy" is abusing the Google Gemini AI model to help it achieve persistence on infected devices.

"In February 2026, we uncovered two versions of a previously unknown Android malware family," explains ESET.

"The first version, which we named VNCSpy, appeared on VirusTotal on January 13th, 2026 and was represented by three samples uploaded from Hong Kong. On February 10th, 2026, four samples of more advanced malware based on VNCSpy were uploaded to VirusTotal from Argentina."

First known Android malware to use generative AI

While machine learning models have previously been used by Android malware to analyze screenshots for ad fraud, ESET says that PromptSpy is the first known case of Android malware integrating generative AI directly into its execution.

On some Android devices, users can "lock" or "pin" an app in the Recent Apps list by long-pressing it and selecting a lock option. When an app is locked this way, Android is less likely to terminate it during memory cleanup or when the user taps "Clear all."

For legitimate apps, this prevents background processes from being killed. For malware like PromptSpy, it can serve as a persistence mechanism.

However, the method used to lock or pin an app varies between manufacturers, making it hard for malware to script the right way to do so on every device. That is where AI comes into play.

PromptSpy sends Google's Gemini model a chat prompt along with an XML dump of the current screen, including the visible UI elements, text labels, class types, and screen coordinates.

Gemini then responds with JSON-formatted instructions describing the action to take on the device to pin the app.

The malware executes the action through Android's Accessibility Service, retrieves the updated screen state, and sends it back to Gemini in a loop until the AI confirms that the app has been successfully locked in the recent apps list.

"Even though PromptSpy uses Gemini in just one of its features, it still demonstrates how incorporating these AI tools can make malware more dynamic, giving threat actors ways to automate actions that would normally be more difficult with traditional scripting," explains ESET.

While the use of an AI LLM for run-time changes to behavior is novel, PromptSpy's primary functionality is to act as spyware.

The malware includes a built-in VNC module that allows the threat actors to gain full remote access to devices with Accessibility permissions are granted.

Using this access, the threat actors can view and control the Android screen in real time.

According to ESET, the malware can:

Upload a list of installed apps

Intercept lockscreen PINs or passwords

Record the pattern unlock screen as a video

Capture screenshots on demand

Record screen activity and user gestures

Report the current foreground application and screen status

To make removal harder, when users attempt to uninstall the app or turn off Accessibility permissions, the malware overlays transparent, invisible rectangles over UI buttons that display strings like "stop," "end," "clear," and "Uninstall."

When a user taps the button to stop or uninstall the app, they will instead tap the invisible button, which blocks removal.

Unclear if its a proof-of-concept malware

Stefanko says that victims must reboot into Android Safe Mode so that third-party apps are disabled and cannot block the malware's uninstall.

ESET told BleepingComputer that it has not yet observed PromptSpy or its dropper in its telemetry, so it is unclear whether the malware is a proof-of-concept.

"We haven't seen any signs of the PromptSpy dropper or its payload in our telemetry so far, which could mean they're only proofs of concept," Stefanko told BleepingComputer.

However, as VirusTotal indicates that several samples were previously distributed via the dedicated domain mgardownload[.]com and used a web page on m-mgarg[.]com to impersonate JPMorgan Chase Bank, it may have been used in actual attacks.

"Still, because there appears to be a dedicated domain that was used to distribute them, and fake bank website, we can't rule out the possibility that both the dropper and PromptSpy are or were in the wild," Štefanko added.

While the distribution of this malware appears very limited, it demonstrates how threat actors are using generative AI to not only create attacks and phishing sites, but also to modify malware behavior in real time.

Earlier this month, Google Threat Intelligence reported that state-sponsored hackers are also using Google's Gemini AI model to support all stages of their attacks, from reconnaissance to post-compromise actions.

[9] BleepingComputer - Flaw in Grandstream VoIP phones allows stealthy eavesdropping
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[TAM METİN - 529 kelime]
A critical vulnerability in Grandstream GXP1600 series VoIP phones allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to gain root privileges and silently eavesdrop on communications.

VoIP communication equipment from Grandstream Networks is being used by small and medium businesses. The maker's GXP product line is part of the company's high-end offering for businesses, schools, hotels, and Internet Telephony Service Providers (ITSP) around the world.

The vulnerability is tracked as CVE-2026-2329 and received a critical severity score of 9.3. It impacts the following six models of the GXP1600 series of devices that run firmware versions prior to 1.0.7.81:

Even if a vulnerable device is not directly reachable over the public internet, an attacker can pivot to it from another host on the network. Exploitation is silent, and everything works as expected.

In a technical report, Rapid7 researchers explain that the problem is in the device’s web-based API service (/cgi-bin/api.values.get), which is accessible without authentication in the default configuration.

The API accepts a ‘request’ parameter containing colon-delimited identifiers, which is parsed into a 64-byte stack buffer without performing a length check when copying characters into the buffer.

Because of this, an attacker supplying overly long input can cause a stack overflow, overwriting adjacent memory to gain control over multiple CPU registers, such as the Program Counter.

Rapid7 researchers developed a working Metasploit module to demonstrate unauthenticated remote code execution as root by exploiting CVE-2026-2329.

Exploitation enables arbitrary OS command execution, extracting stored credentials of local users and SIP accounts, and reconfiguring the device to use a malicious SIP proxy that allows eavesdropping on calls.

Rapid7 researchers say that successful exploitation requires writing multiple null bytes to construct a return-oriented programming (ROP) chain. However, CVE-2026-2329 permits writing of only one null terminator byte during the overflow.

To bypass the restriction, the researchers used multiple colon-separated identifiers to trigger the overflow repeatedly and write null bytes multiple times.

“Every time a colon is encountered, the overflow can be triggered a subsequent time via the next identifier,” explain the researchers in the technical writeup.

“We can leverage this, and the ability to write a single null byte as the last character in the current identifier being processed, to write multiple null bytes during exploitation.”

The researchers contacted Grandstream on January 6 and again on January 20 after receiving no response.

Eventually, Grandstream fixed the issue on February 3, with the release of firmware version 1.0.7.81.

Technical details and a module for the Metasploit penetration testing and exploitation framework. Users of vulnerable Grandstream products are strongly advised to apply available security updates as soon as possible.

[10] BleepingComputer - Google blocked over 1.75 million Play Store app submissions in 2025

Google says that through 2025, it blocked more than 255,000 Android apps from obtaining excessive access to sensitive user data and rejected over 1.75 million apps from being published on Google Play due to policy violations.

The tech giant's annual review of Android and Google Play security reveals how effective the implemented protection measures were in maintaining an ecosystem with honest developers and compliant apps.

"We’re constantly improving our policies and protections to encourage safe, high-quality apps on Google Play and stop bad actors before they cause harm," Google says.

To this end, the company implemented more than 10,000 safety checks on published apps and strengthened detection capabilities by integrating Google’s latest generative AI models into the review process. This enabled human reviewers to identify complex and evolving malicious patterns more quickly and accurately.

The highlights in terms of user protection last year include banning more than 80,000 "bad developer accounts, detecting over 1.75 million policy-violating apps, and denying over 255,000 apps access to sensitive user data.

Spam ratings and inauthentic reviews also represented a significant risk as they can be used to influence user perception of an app.

Google says it blocked 160 million ratings last year and prevented an average 0.5-star drop that apps targeted by “review bombing” would otherwise have suffered.

Android’s built-in security suite, Play Protect, which now scans over 350 billion apps every day, has identified over 27 million malicious apps sideloaded from outside Google Play.

Play Protect’s ‘enhanced fraud protection’ was expanded to cover over 2.8 billion Android devices in 185 markets, blocking 266 million installation attempts from 872,000 unique risky apps.

The Play Integrity API service that app developers can use to protect their software against abuse and unauthorized access, now processes over 20 billion checks every day, Google says. In 2025, new hardware-backed signals and in-app remediation prompts were added.

Finally, Google has added built-in protections against “tapjacking attacks” with minimal developer effort in Android 16, released last June, blocking hidden windows loading ads that are automatically tapped for fraudulent financial gains.

Google says it will continue investing in AI-driven defenses, expand developer verification, and embed compliance tools directly into development workflows to prevent policy violations before apps are published.

[11] BleepingComputer - CISA orders feds to patch actively exploited Dell flaw within 3 days
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[TAM METİN - 528 kelime]
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) ordered government agencies to patch their systems within three days against a maximum-severity Dell vulnerability that has been under active exploitation since mid-2024.

According to security researchers from Mandiant and the Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG), this hardcoded-credential vulnerability (CVE-2026-22769) in Dell's RecoverPoint (a solution used for VMware virtual machine backup and recovery) is being exploited by a suspected Chinese hacking group tracked as UNC6201.

After gaining access to a victim's network in CVE-2026-22769 attacks, UNC6201 deploys several malware payloads, including a newly identified backdoor called Grimbolt. This malware is built using a relatively new compilation technique that makes it harder to analyze than its predecessor, the Brickstorm backdoor.

While the group swapped Brickstorm for Grimbolt in September 2025, it's not yet clear whether this switch was part of a planned upgrade or "a reaction to incident response efforts led by Mandiant and other industry partners."

"Analysis of incident response engagements revealed that UNC6201, a suspected PRC-nexus threat cluster, has exploited this flaw since at least mid-2024 to move laterally, maintain persistent access, and deploy malware including SLAYSTYLE, BRICKSTORM, and a novel backdoor tracked as GRIMBOLT," they said.

The security researchers have also found overlaps between UNC6201 and the Silk Typhoon Chinese state-backed cyberespionage group (although the two are not considered identical by GTIG), also tracked as UNC5221 and known for exploiting Ivanti zero-days to target government agencies with custom Spawnant and Zipline malware.

Silk Typhoon has previously breached the systems of several U.S. government agencies, including the U.S. Treasury Department, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), and the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS).

Feds ordered to prioritize CVE-2026-22769 patches

CISA has now added the security flaw to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog on Wednesday and ordered Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to secure their networks by the end of Saturday, February 21, as mandated by Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01.

"These types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise," CISA warned on Wednesday.

"Apply mitigations per vendor instructions, follow applicable BOD 22-01 guidance for cloud services, or discontinue use of the product if mitigations are unavailable."

Last week, CISA also gave U.S. federal agencies three days to secure their BeyondTrust Remote Support instances against an actively exploited remote code execution vulnerability (CVE-2026-1731).

Hacktron, which reported the vulnerability on January 31, warned in early February that around 11,000 BeyondTrust Remote Support instances were exposed online, and that around 8,500 were on-premises deployments that required manual patching.

[12] BleepingComputer - How infostealers turn stolen credentials into real identities
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Thu, 19 Feb 2026 10:05:15 -0500
Link: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/how-infostealers-turn-stolen-credentials-into-real-identities/

[TAM METİN - 862 kelime]
Modern infostealers have expanded credential theft far beyond usernames and passwords. Over the past year, campaigns have accelerated, targeting users with little distinction between corporate employees and individuals on personal devices.

These infections routinely harvest credentials alongside broader session data and user activity. The resulting datasets are aggregated and sold by initial access brokers, then reused across attacks targeting both personal and enterprise environments.

To better understand the scope and implications of this activity, Specops researchers analyzed more than 90,000 leaked infostealer dumps, comprising over 800 million rows of data collected during active infections.

What emerges is a clear picture of how infostealer dumps allow attackers to associate technical data with real users, organizations, and behavioral patterns, making a single infection valuable long after the initial compromise.

When stolen credentials become identity data

The biggest risk is how easily infostealer data ties multiple accounts and behaviors back to one real person. These dumps routinely expose reused account names across services, Windows usernames, files stored in user directories, active session data, and detailed records of activity across environments.

Combined, these signals let attackers move from a single compromised credential to identifying an individual, their employer, and potentially their role within an organization.

This convergence collapses the boundary between personal and professional identity that many security models still assume exists. What may start as a compromise on a personal device can quickly escalate into enterprise-level risk.

Specops Password Policy helps organizations break this link by continuously scanning Active Directory against a database of more than 5.4 billion known-compromised credentials, rather than only checking passwords at creation or reset.

Credentials that have already been exposed are blocked from being set or reused, even if they technically comply with policy, reducing the risk of compromised passwords being reused across personal and corporate accounts.

Secure your Active Directory passwords with Specops Password Policy

Verizon’s Data Breach Investigation Report found stolen credentials are involved in 44.7% of breaches. 
 
Effortlessly secure Active Directory with compliant password policies, blocking 4+ billion compromised passwords, boosting security, and slashing support hassles!

Where infostealers get your data and how they abuse it

The dataset contained credentials and session data associated with a wide range of services, illustrating how infostealer data exposes both identity and access.

Professional and enterprise-linked services

LinkedIn, GitHub, Microsoft Teams, Outlook, and corporate domains appeared frequently in the dataset. LinkedIn alone accounted for nearly 900,000 records, providing a direct path from stolen data to real names, job titles, and organizational affiliations.

For threat actors, this information enables targeted phishing, social engineering, and prioritization of access that may lead deeper into enterprise environments, especially where password reuse exists.

Personal identity and social platforms

YouTube, Facebook, and similar social media platforms also made high-volume appearances. These services often contain real names, photos, and social connections, making it easier to validate the identity of a compromised user and link them to other accounts.

This correlation makes targeted exploitation far easier.

Sensitive and high-risk services

In previous incidents, threat actors have used data from adult platforms as leverage for extortion and blackmail. When that activity can be linked back to an individual’s real identity and employer, the potential impact escalates quickly.

Security-aware yet still exposed

Domains such as Shodan and even mil.gov appeared within the dataset, reinforcing an uncomfortable reality: technical awareness does not equal immunity.

Secure practices followed in corporate environments do not always extend to personal systems, yet exposure on those systems can still create enterprise risk.

Why infostealers remain so effective

Infostealer exposure isn’t driven by a single failure, but by a combination of common behaviors repeated at scale. Users install applications from illicit sources, reuse passwords across personal and corporate accounts, and rely on browser-based credential storage for convenience.

Browser-stored credentials and payment data are especially valuable to attackers.

When an infostealer compromises a system, these stores provide attackers with immediate access to high-value information, significantly increasing the impact of a single infection.

Reducing impact after credential theft

Once infostealer data has been collected and circulated, prevention is no longer the only challenge. The real question is how quickly defenders can neutralize it before it’s reused for lateral movement, account takeover, or ransomware deployment.

Because infostealer dumps often circulate for weeks or months before detection, effective mitigation must assume that some credentials are already exposed.

Password reuse remains one of the most reliable ways attackers operationalize infostealer data. Credentials harvested from personal devices are routinely tested against corporate environments, cloud services, and remote access systems, often with success even when those passwords meet standard complexity requirements.

Disrupting reuse directly reduces the operational value of infostealer datasets and shortens their window of exploitation.

Combined with stronger password policies that support longer passphrases and continuous enforcement, these controls shift password security from a static configuration exercise to an active containment measure.

Identity exposure increasingly begins outside the corporate perimeter, so reducing the reuse and downstream impact of stolen credentials remains one of the most effective ways to break infostealer-driven attack chains.

INTERPOL’s Operation Red Card 2.0, a joint effort involving law enforcement agencies from 16 African countries, resulted in 651 arrests linked to online scam networks.

The operation was carried out under the African Joint Operation against Cybercrime (AFJOC), funded by the UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office. It also received targeted support from the EU–Council of Europe’s GLACY-e (Global Action on Cybercrime Enhanced) project.

Authorities also recovered more than $4.3 million in illicit proceeds, marking a significant coordinated crackdown on cybercrime across the region.

“Law enforcement agencies from 16 African countries have made 651 arrests and recovered more than USD 4.3 million in an international cybercrime operation against online scams.” reads the press release published by INTERPOL. “Operation Red Card 2.0 (8 December 2025 to 30 January 2026) targeted the infrastructure and actors behind high-yield investment scams, mobile money fraud and fraudulent mobile loan applications.”

Operation Red Card 2.0, conducted from 8 December 2025 to 30 January 2026, targeted networks behind high-yield investment scams, mobile money fraud and fake loan apps. The law enforcement operation uncovered schemes tied to over $45 million in losses and 1,247 victims worldwide. Authorities seized 2,341 devices and dismantled 1,442 malicious IPs, domains and servers, with INTERPOL providing intelligence and forensic support.

Investigators exposed a wide range of scam models across Africa. In Nigeria, police dismantled a major investment fraud ring that used phishing and fake crypto schemes, shutting down over 1,000 social media accounts and raiding its operations hub. Kenya arrested 27 suspects behind fake investment offers promoted via messaging apps. Côte d’Ivoire detained 58 people tied to abusive mobile loan scams. Nigerian authorities also arrested six hackers who breached a telecom provider to resell stolen airtime. INTERPOL supported the crackdown with key intelligence from global cybersecurity partners.

“These organized cybercriminal syndicates inflict devastating financial and psychological harm on individuals, businesses and entire communities with their false promises.  Operation Red Card highlights the importance of collaboration when combatting transnational cybercrime. I encourage all victims of cybercrime to reach out to law enforcement for help.” Neal Jetton, INTERPOL’s Director of the Cybercrime Directorate, said.

[14] Security Affairs - PromptSpy abuses Gemini AI to gain persistent access on Android
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[TAM METİN - 699 kelime]
Security researchers at ESET have uncovered PromptSpy, the first known Android malware to exploit Google’s Gemini AI to maintain persistence. The malware can capture lockscreen data, block uninstallation attempts, collect device information, take screenshots, and record screen activity as video, marking a concerning evolution in AI-assisted mobile threats.

This is the second AI-powered malware discovered by ESET, following PromptLock in August 2025, the first known case of AI-driven ransomware.

Although AI is used only to keep the malicious app pinned in the recent apps list, it allows the malware to adapt to different devices and Android versions.

“Specifically, Gemini is used to analyze the current screen and provide PromptSpy with step-by-step instructions on how to ensure the malicious app remains pinned in the recent apps list, thus preventing it from being easily swiped away or killed by the system.” reads the report published by ESET. “The AI model and prompt are predefined in the code and cannot be changed. Since Android malware often relies on UI navigation, leveraging generative AI enables the threat actors to adapt to more or less any device, layout, or OS version, which can greatly expand the pool of potential victims.”

PromptSpy deploys a VNC module for remote control, abuses Accessibility Services to block removal, captures lockscreen data, records video, and uses encrypted C2 communications. The campaign appears to be driven by financial gain and mainly targets users in Argentina. The malware was likely developed in a Chinese-speaking environment. It is spread through a dedicated website rather than Google Play, and Google Play Protect can block known versions of it.

PromptSpy uses Google’s Gemini AI in a limited but clever way: to stay persistent. Instead of relying on fixed screen taps or coordinates, which often fail across different Android versions and device layouts, the malware sends Gemini a text prompt plus an XML dump of the current screen. This gives the AI a full view of buttons, text, and positions. Gemini then replies with JSON instructions telling the malware where to tap. PromptSpy repeats the process until the app is successfully locked in the recent apps list, preventing easy removal.

ESET discovered the threat in February 2026, PromptSpy evolved from an earlier variant called VNCSpy. Samples were uploaded from Hong Kong and later Argentina, suggesting regional targeting. The malware is distributed through malicious websites impersonating Chase Bank, using branding like “MorganArg.” A related phishing app, likely from the same actor, helps deliver the final payload.

Once installed, PromptSpy abuses Accessibility Services and includes a VNC module, giving attackers full remote control of the device. It can see the screen, perform gestures, and maintain control while staying hidden in the recent apps list.

The analysis of the malicious code revealed debug strings in simplified Chinese, along with functions handling Chinese Accessibility event types. A disabled debug method translated Android accessibility events into Chinese, suggesting with medium confidence that the malware was developed in a Chinese-speaking environment.

PromptSpy is delivered through a dropper that installs a hidden payload APK. After installation, it requests Accessibility permissions, shows a fake loading screen, and secretly contacts Gemini AI to lock itself in the Recent Apps list for persistence. It continuously sends screen data to Gemini and executes returned tap or swipe instructions.

The malware includes a VNC module for full remote control and communicates with its C2 server using AES-encrypted VNC traffic. It can steal PINs, record screens, take screenshots, and list installed apps. To prevent removal, it overlays invisible elements over uninstall buttons. Victims must reboot into Safe Mode to remove it.

PromptSpy shows a new evolution in Android malware. By using generative AI to read and interpret on-screen elements, it can adapt to almost any device or interface. Instead of fixed tap coordinates, it sends a screen snapshot to AI and receives step-by-step instructions, making its persistence more resilient to UI changes.

“More broadly, this campaign shows how generative AI can make malware far more dynamic and capable of real‑time decision‑making.” concludes the report. “PromptSpy is an early example of generative AI‑powered Android malware, and it illustrates how quickly attackers are beginning to misuse AI tools to improve impact.”

Germany’s rail operator Deutsche Bahn was hit by a large-scale DDoS attack that disrupted information and booking systems for several hours. The cyberattack affected IT operations, causing delays and service interruptions. At this time, the rail giant fully recovered its operations.

“There may currently be disruptions to the information and booking systems of Deutsche Bahn. Our IT experts are already working on analyzing the cause and resolving the issue.” read an update published by the company on its status page. The information and booking systems of Deutsche Bahn have been largely stable again since the evening.

The DDoS attack on German rail operator started on February 17 and extended into February 18. The DDoS shut down the company’s IT systems, bahn.de and DB Navigator.

It’s unclear who is behind the attack and what their motivation. In past years, European critical infrastructure and government organizations were targeted with DDoS attack powered by pro-Russian hacktivists like Killnet and NoName057(16).

The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) added Dell RecoverPoint and GitLab flaws to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog.

The first vulnerability added to the catalog is a server-side request forgery (SSRF) issue in GitLab, tracked as CVE-2021-22175.

“When requests to the internal network for webhooks are enabled, a server-side request forgery vulnerability in GitLab affecting all versions starting from 10.5 was possible to exploit for an unauthenticated attacker even on a GitLab instance where registration is disabled” reads the advisory.

In March 2025, Threat intelligence firm GreyNoise observed Grafana path traversal exploitation attempts before the Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) surge on March 9, suggesting that attackers may be leveraging Grafana as an initial entry point for deeper exploitation. One of the vulnerabilities exploited in the attacks observed by the experts is CVE-2020-7796. Most Server-Side Request Forgery exploitation attempts targeted entities in the United States, Germany, Singapore, India, Lithuania, Japan, and Israel.

The experts warned that attackers leverage SSRF for pivoting and reconnaissance and cloud exploitation.

The second flaw added to the KeV catalog is a Dell RecoverPoint for Virtual Machines (RP4VMs) Use of Hard-coded Credentials Vulnerability tracked as CVE-2026-22769. The vulnerability involves hardcoded credentials and was abused to gain access to VMware backup systems.

This week, Mandiant and Google’s Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) reported that a suspected China-linked APT group quietly exploited a critical zero-day flaw in Dell RecoverPoint for Virtual Machines starting in mid-2024.

“Mandiant and Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) have identified the zero-day exploitation of a high-risk vulnerability in Dell RecoverPoint for Virtual Machines, tracked as CVE-2026-22769, with a CVSSv3.1 score of 10.0.” reads the report published by Google. “Analysis of incident response engagements revealed that UNC6201, a suspected PRC-nexus threat cluster, has exploited this flaw since at least mid-2024 to move laterally, maintain persistent access, and deploy malware including SLAYSTYLE, BRICKSTORM, and a novel backdoor tracked as GRIMBOLT.”

The China-nexus group exploited the bug to move laterally, maintain persistence, and deploy malware such as SLAYSTYLE, BRICKSTORM, and a new C# backdoor, GRIMBOLT. Researchers observed advanced tactics, including stealthy VMware pivoting via “Ghost NICs” and Single Packet Authorization with iptables. Dell has released patches and mitigation guidance.

During investigations into compromised Dell RecoverPoint appliances, Mandiant researchers discovered that attackers replaced BRICKSTORM with a new C# backdoor, GRIMBOLT, in September 2025. GRIMBOLT is compiled using Native AOT and packed with UPX. The malware provides remote shell access and reuses BRICKSTORM’s command-and-control channels.

The attackers ensured persistence by modifying a legitimate startup script so the backdoor runs automatically at boot.

While investigating compromised Dell RecoverPoint systems, Mandiant uncovered CVE-2026-22769 after spotting Tomcat Manager access using hardcoded admin credentials. Attackers uploaded a malicious WAR file containing the SLAYSTYLE web shell, gaining root command execution as early as mid-2024. The group also expanded into VMware environments, creating “Ghost NICs” for stealthy lateral movement and using iptables-based Single Packet Authorization to covertly redirect and control traffic on vCenter appliances.

According to Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities, FCEB agencies have to address the identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect their networks against attacks exploiting the flaws in the catalog.

Experts also recommend that private organizations review the Catalog and address the vulnerabilities in their infrastructure.

CISA urges federal agencies to fix the Dell RecoverPoint flaw by the end of this week, on February 21, while ordering the agencies to address the GitLab issue by March 11, 2026.

Under the Hood of DynoWiper

[This is a Guest Diary contributed by John Moutos]

In this post, I'm going over my analysis of DynoWiper, a wiper family that was discovered during attacks against Polish energy companies in late December of 2025. ESET Research [1] and CERT Polska [2] have linked the activity and supporting malware to infrastructure and tradecraft associated with Russian state-aligned threat actors, with ESET assessing the campaign as consistent with operations attributed to Russian APT Sandworm [3], who are notorious for attacking Ukrainian companies and infrastructure, with major incidents spanning throughout years 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2022. For more insight into Sandworm or the chain of compromise leading up to the deployment of DynoWiper, ESET and CERT Polska published their findings in great detail, and I highly recommend reading them for context.

The sample analyzed in this post is a 32-bit Windows executable, and is version A of DynoWiper.

SHA-256 835b0d87ed2d49899ab6f9479cddb8b4e03f5aeb2365c50a51f9088dcede68d5 [4]

To start, I ran the binary straight through DIE [5] (Detect It Easy) catch any quick wins regarding packing or obfuscation, but this sample does not appear to utilize either (unsurprising for wiper malware). To IDA [6] we go!

Figure 1: Detect It Easy

Jumping right past the CRT setup to the WinMain function, DynoWiper first initializes a Mersenne Twister PRNG (MT19937) context, with the fixed seed value of 5489 and a state size of 624.

Figure 2: Main Function

Figure 3: Mersenne Twister Init

The MT19937 state is then re-seeded and reinitialized with a random value generated using std::random_device, the 624 word state is rebuilt, and a 16-byte value is generated.

Figure 4: Mersenne Twister Seed

Immediately following the PRNG setup, the data corruption logic is executed.

Figure 5: Data Corruption Logic

Drives attached to the target host are enumerated with GetLogicalDrives(), and GetDriveTypeW() is used to identify the drive type, to ensure only fixed or removable drives are added to the target drive vector.

Figure 6: Drive Enumeration

Directories and files on said target drives are walked recursively using FindFirstFileW() and FindNextFileW(), while skipping the following protected / OS directories to avoid instability during the corruption process.

Figures 7-8: Directory Traversal

For each applicable file, attributes are cleared with SetFileAttributesW(), and a handle to the file is created using CreateFileW(). The file size is obtained using GetFileSize(), and the start of the file located through SetFilePointerEx(). A 16 byte junk data buffer derived from the PRNG context is written to the start of the file using WriteFile(). In cases where the file size exceeds 16 bytes, pseudo-random locations throughout the file are generated, with the count determined by the file size, and a maximum count of 4096. The current file pointer is again repositioned to each generated location with SetFilePointerEx(), and the same 16 byte data buffer is written again, continuing the file corruption process.

Figure 9: Random File Offset Generation

Figure 10: File Corruption

With all the target files damaged and the data corruption process complete, the data deletion process begins

Figure 11: Data Deletion Logic

Similar to the file corruption process, drives attached to the target host are enumerated, target directories are walked recursively and target files are removed with DeleteFileW() instead of writing junk data, as seen in the file corruption logic

Figure 12: File Deletion

To finish, the wiper obtains its own process token using OpenProcessToken(), enables SeShutdownPrivilege through AdjustTokenPrivileges(), and issues a system reboot with ExitWindowsEx().

2025 Cloud Threat Hunting and Defense Landscape

Insikt Group has observed continued trends of growth and increased activity of threat actors leveraging and exploiting cloud infrastructure to broaden the number of victims they target and infect. Recent reporting across the observed incidents shows that cloud-focused threats are converging on a few consistent patterns, which serve as the main sections of this report:

Exploitation and Misconfiguration

Credential Abuse, Account Takeover, and Unauthorized Access

Third-Party Compromise

Across cases, initial access frequently comes from vulnerable or misconfigured services exposed to the internet — including application delivery controllers, monitoring dashboards, email security gateways, and enterprise resource planning (ERP) platforms — as well as stolen or weakly governed credentials sourced from public leaks, compromised developer workstations, and socially engineered helpdesk workflows. Once inside a targeted environment, threat actors systematically pivot through hybrid identity and virtual private network (VPN) infrastructure, targeting directory-synchronized accounts, non-human and executive identities, and privileged cloud roles to gain tenant-wide administrative control.

Post-compromise activity is characterized by heavy use of built-in cloud and SaaS functionality: enumerating and exfiltrating data via native storage and backup services, destroying or encrypting cloud backups and snapshots for impact, manipulating static frontends and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines to subvert trust in applications and repositories, and using mainstream platforms such as calendar services as covert command-and-control (C2) channels.

In comparison to its previous iteration, the majority of the events discussed in this report indicate that threat actors are engaging in similar threat behaviors; however, there are three specific trends that appear to have emerged since the most recent iteration:

Cloud threat actors are registering their own legitimate cloud resources for use in attack chains.

DDOS attacks are becoming less effective when targeting cloud environments, even in instances of record-breaking throughput, due to increased cloud-native capabilities for mitigating these threats.

Cloud threat actors are increasingly diversifying the types of services that they target in victim environments during an attack chain, with a notable focus on LLM and other AI-powered services hosted in cloud environments.

The trends associated with abuse indicate a shift in threat actor perception, demonstrating that threat actors are exploring the broader benefits that compromised cloud services can provide.

The threat of exploitation and misconfiguration grows as the number of cloud services and third-party technologies embedded at the perimeter of cloud environments grows.

Threat actors are displaying increased interest in the abuse of compromised victim cloud LLM and machine learning (ML) services, both for profit and as a method of post-compromise during attack chains.

Threat actors use trusted identities and cloud-native tools to directly execute their end goals, such as ransomware, disruption, data destruction, and data theft, without relying on traditional malware.

Instead of deploying large numbers of ransomware binaries, threat actors use compromised accounts, roles, tokens, and keys to change encryption settings, rotate or destroy key material, or mass-modify stored data through cloud application programming interfaces (APIs) and consoles.

Compromising a third party or supply chain provides attackers with inherited trust and permissions, enabling them to inject malicious code, access data, and modify configurations across multiple cloud tenants.

The rapid adoption and continuous evolution of cloud services have created a distinct and expanding attack space threat actors actively exploit. As organizations continue to move core systems and sensitive data from traditionally isolated, on-premises environments into internet-accessible cloud platforms, adversaries treat these deployments as a centralized collection of valuable data and often-weak security controls. They take advantage of widespread misconfigurations, uneven cloud security expertise, and the uniformity of major cloud and SaaS platforms, using publicly available discovery tools to scan at scale for exposed assets and insecure settings. At the same time, threat actors increasingly leverage cloud infrastructure for their own operations, using commercial services to host malware, maintain command-and-control, and stage data exfiltration. The same flexibility, reach, and obscured attribution that cloud services provide to legitimate users enables threat actors to blend malicious traffic with legitimate activity.

Defenders, meanwhile, operate in an environment where cloud computing is mature in terms of adoption, but still early in its practical use and secure implementation. Security teams must contend with rapidly changing product offerings, constant feature updates, and complex, distributed architectures that make it difficult to maintain complete visibility and consistent controls across regions, tenants, and services. Many organizations adopt cloud technologies with limited in-house expertise, unrealistic expectations, or suboptimal implementations, and they frequently report shortages of senior personnel capable of securely architecting and managing these environments. Skill and knowledge gaps, combined with the scale and constant change of cloud environments, result in configuration drift, unmonitored assets, and security blind spots. As a result, defenders face a growing burden: protecting highly available, globally distributed systems that deliver business value but simultaneously increase the organization’s attack surface and the likelihood of successful compromise.

This report identifies five main threats to cloud environments, each of which is explored in its respective section:

Exploitation and Misconfiguration

Credential Abuse, Account Takeover, and Unauthorized Access

Third-Party Compromise

Each section includes radar charts that measure the following attributes associated with a given threat. These determinations were made by Insikt Group by investigating instances where a threat vector was observed to answer the following questions:

Cost of Impact: How much would this threat cost a victim in terms of monetary, reputational, and operational losses? In the radar chart, the higher the number, the higher the cost the victim can expect to receive monetarily, reputationally, operationally, or otherwise.

Commonality: How often is this threat vector observed in attack chains against cloud environments in the wild? In the radar chart, the higher the number, the more likely a cloud defender is to observe this behavior in their own environment.

Evolution Potential: What is the potential for threat actors to further “evolve” this attack vector in terms of new tools, attack methods, and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that can be employed to achieve this threat vector? In the radar chart, the higher the number, the more likely it is that threat actors will be able to perform actions demonstrating this threat in ways previously unobserved, thereby complicating the behavior’s detection.

Effort to Perform: What are the technical and monetary costs associated with performing this threat vector? In the radar chart, the higher the number, the greater the barrier for an attacker to demonstrate this threat against a cloud environment, generally in terms of monetary cost or technical capability.

Threats To Cloud Environments

Exploitation and Misconfiguration

Figure 1 illustrates and compares attributes associated with cloud abuse. A description of each attribute can be found in the Methodology section of this report.

Cost of Impact: 3 (Moderate)

As previously determined by Insikt Group: “Successful exploitation of cloud infrastructure or the technologies embedded in it may result in multiple benefits to a threat actor, but may not directly translate to victim cost.” This determination can also be applied to the risks posed by misconfigured cloud infrastructure, as discussed in this report. In both instances, while exploitation and misconfiguration often allow threat actors to gain initial access, additional internal access, or increased permissions within a cloud environment, the overall impact on a cloud environment is not explicitly tied to exploitability or a threat actor’s ability to exploit misconfigurations.

Commonality: 5 (Very High)

Misconfigurations are a common risk in cloud environments, and threat research has consistently shown that they are frequently exploited by threat actors as an initial access vector. While not as commonly exploited for initial access, cloud environments inherit a myriad of vulnerability-related risks from third-party technologies often embedded within them.

Insikt Group additionally notes that multiple critical vulnerabilities were identified in cloud-native services within the past year; however, based on Insikt Group’s research, these vulnerabilities are discovered and disclosed much less often than vulnerabilities in the technologies embedded in cloud infrastructure.

Evolution Potential: 3 (Moderate)

The risk presented by misconfigurations and vulnerability exploitation in cloud environments is bounded by the technologies and services implemented within it. As new technologies and services become available and existing ones undergo updates, new misconfiguration and exploitation risks may arise. At the same time, threat actors can only capitalize on these risks in the context of the vulnerable or misconfigured technology or service, limiting the overall evolution potential of this risk.

Effort to Perform: 2 (Low)

Identifying known misconfigurations and vulnerabilities externally is a straightforward process for threat actors. Numerous tools exist that allow threat actors to programmatically identify and, in some cases, automatically exploit these weaknesses. Vulnerability research is much more challenging than abusing and weaponizing open-source proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits; however, based on data collected by Recorded Future, scanning and exploitation attempts indicate that vulnerability and reconnaissance activity following a vulnerability disclosure is a significantly more likely threat to defenders in terms of volume.

Data collected over the past year indicates that cloud misconfiguration and vulnerability exploitation continue to pose a critical risk to defenders, alongside common attack vectors that threat actors will exploit both within and outside cloud environments. These weaknesses enable threat actors to gain access and establish false legitimacy in cloud environments, serving as a means to achieve their ultimate goals as they continually target the environment.

Misconfiguration is an issue that cloud providers, architects, and security experts continuously attempt to mitigate in cloud environments; however, this cycle of human misconfiguration remediation can also present misconfigurations. The human, operational, and financial costs associated with monitoring, identifying, and mitigating misconfigurations in cloud environments are high. Additionally, as cloud computing continues to grow, cloud-native service offerings and the infrastructure itself also continue to grow, leading to mitigation challenges created by an increased external attack surface. Defenders must remain aware of new iterations of cloud services to ensure that configuration best practices are followed.

Exploitation in cloud environments is not as commonly identified as instances of misconfigurations due to the managed nature of cloud service providers. However, threat reporting throughout the year demonstrates that exploitation occurs both within and at the perimeter of cloud environments.

Threat actors are expected to continue focusing on cloud environments as attractive targets, leveraging a combination of configuration weaknesses and the exploitation of vulnerable public-facing technologies, particularly in the wake of high-profile vulnerability disclosures.

Based on current trends, exposure-driven risks, including configuration-related issues and unpatched or newly disclosed vulnerabilities, are likely to remain a consistent factor in cloud compromises, often enabling initial access while also impacting internal cloud services and supporting infrastructure.

As cloud adoption continues to accelerate, the volume and diversity of deployed services and technologies will also grow. This expansion increases the likelihood of both exploitable vulnerabilities and unintended exposures, reinforcing the importance of scalable security controls, timely patching, and continuous visibility across cloud environments.

Mitigations and Detections

Figure 2 illustrates a hypothetical attack chain involving misconfiguration and exploitation methods. Throughout this visual, Insikt Group has identified parts of the attack chain where defenders can most efficiently hunt for and mitigate behaviors associated with cloud misconfiguration and exploitation.

① Exploit Attempts Targeting Public-Facing Cloud Services and Appliances

Unpatched or misconfigured internet-exposed services, such as application gateways, VPN portals, and web applications, are frequent targets for initial access. Successful exploitation can grant remote code execution, credential theft, and a foothold for lateral movement into cloud and on-premise resources.

Defenders can mitigate these threats in the following ways:

Maintain an up-to-date inventory of public-facing services and prioritize rapid patching and hardening of edge systems.

Restrict direct internet exposure of administrative interfaces by placing them behind a VPN, zero-trust network access (ZTNA), or IP allowlists.

Use web application firewalls (WAFs) and reverse proxies to provide virtual patching, request validation, and detection of common exploit patterns.

Analyze web and edge logs for scanning behavior, abnormal HTTP patterns, and indicators of exploit attempts, backed by intrusion detection systems (IDS) or intrusion prevention systems (IPS) where appropriate.

② Script-Based Post-Compromise Activity

After gaining a foothold, threat actors often rely on script-based execution, such as PowerShell and other interpreters, with obfuscation and in-memory techniques to download tools, disable defenses, and move laterally while avoiding obvious file-based indicators.

Defenders can mitigate these threats in the following ways:

Restrict script execution and enforce the use of signed, approved scripts by applying application control to critical systems.

Enable and centralize detailed script logging, such as script block logging and Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI) output, for analysis and detection.

Detect encoded, obfuscated, or unusually long command lines and scripts launched from unexpected parent processes.

Use endpoint detection and response (EDR) to identify suspicious script behavior, including credential access, lateral movement, and tampering with security controls.

③ Unauthorized Remote Access Tools or Anomalous Binary Execution

Threat actors frequently deploy or repurpose remote access and management tools, as well as renamed or portable binaries, to maintain persistent and interactive access. These binaries often masquerade as legitimate activity and may use scheduled tasks or services for durability.

Defenders can mitigate these threats in the following ways:

Monitor process execution for known RMM tools and binaries running from unusual or user-writable locations.

Apply behavior-based EDR and application allowlisting to block unauthorized, unsigned, or renamed executables.

Restrict installation and use of RMM and remote access software to approved tools and authorized administrators.

Monitor for new or modified scheduled tasks, services, and startup entries referencing unfamiliar binaries or scripts.

④ Privilege Escalation through Identity Federation or Credential Manipulation

Cloud-focused campaigns increasingly abuse identity and federation mechanisms to escalate privileges and maintain long-lived access. By altering federation settings, abusing sync accounts, forging tokens, or creating backdoor identities, attackers can impersonate users, bypass certain multi-factor authentication (MFA) protections, and persist even after password changes.

Defenders can mitigate these threats in the following ways:

Restrict and closely monitor who can modify federation settings, token configurations, and synchronization accounts, and require strong approvals for any changes.

Enforce conditional access, MFA, or passkeys for all administrative and high-impact accounts and avoid legacy protocols that weaken these controls.

Detect unusual token issuance, high-privilege app registrations, and the creation of new federated domains or privileged accounts using identity logs.

Use identity threat detection capabilities to correlate identity, cloud, and directory events and surface unauthorized privilege elevation or token abuse.

Insikt Group curated a list of events published within the past year that demonstrate the threats posed by exploitation and misconfiguration. These events are discussed below.

On October 24, 2025, Palo Alto Networks’s Unit 42 published a report detailing how threat actors abuse AzureHound in Microsoft Azure environments. AzureHound is an open-source data collection tool initially developed by SpecterOps (@SpecterOps) for penetration testing within the BloodHound suite. Per Unit 42, threat actors, specifically the Iranian-linked group Curious Serpens, the suspected state-sponsored threat actor Void Blizzard, and the ransomware operator Storm-0501, repurpose AzureHound in post-compromise discovery phases to map Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory) environments. These operations targeted Azure tenants across hybrid and multi-tenant environments as recently as August 2025, enabling threat actors to perform comprehensive discovery that facilitated lateral movement and privilege escalation.

Based on Unit 42’s analysis, the infection chain begins when threat actors gain initial access to a target’s Azure environment using stolen credentials or authentication tokens. Threat actors then use information-stealing malware, such as Raccoon Stealer and Redline, to acquire credentials and session tokens from the victim’s browser. Using these stolen authentication artifacts, including usernames and passwords, refresh tokens, or JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), threat actors authenticate to the Azure environment. In some cases, they use multi-factor authentication (MFA) fatigue techniques to authenticate into the victim’s Microsoft Entra ID environment. Once authenticated, threat actors use available tokens or service principal credentials to connect to Azure APIs.

After establishing access, threat actors deploy AzureHound to implement the following features and actions:

Enumerate users, devices, and service principals to collect identity information from Microsoft Entra ID

Extract ownership relationships between identities and resources to build a comprehensive identity graph

Save enumerated user data to files like users.json for offline analysis and targeting of high-value accounts

Filter users by job title or attributes to identify privileged roles such as “Global Administrator”

Discover group memberships, roles, and role assignments to uncover potential privilege escalation paths

Identify nested group structures and inherited permissions that may grant elevated access

Enumerate app role assignments and key vault access policies to find excessive or misconfigured permissions

List storage accounts and blob containers to locate data storage locations and assess exposure

Collect storage account metadata, including names, endpoints, access control lists (ACLs), replication type, and custom domains

Reveal network ACLs on storage accounts to identify allowed IP address ranges and trusted services

Discover web, function, and logic applications, automation accounts, and Kubernetes clusters (AKS) to identify cloud services that may be misconfigured or vulnerable

Enumerate container registries and automation pipelines to identify services that may enable code execution or lateral movement

Identify tenants, subscriptions, management groups, resource groups, virtual machines (VMs), and key vaults to understand the cloud environment’s structure and target sensitive assets

Bypass visibility by abusing Azure REST API calls, not recorded in Azure activity or resource logs by default

Trigger test requests to Graph API, Azure REST API, and Microsoft identity platform endpoints using the default AzureHound user-agent string (for example, “azurehound/v2.6.0”)

Export discovery output in JSON format for ingestion into BloodHound to visualize privilege escalation paths and relationships

On October 20, 2025, cybersecurity firm Darktrace published a technical blog detailing a campaign against a European telecommunications organization. According to Darktrace, the campaign, which began in early July 2025, exploited a public-facing Citrix NetScaler Gateway appliance, likely CVE-2023-3519, for initial access and deployed SnappyBee (also known as Deed RAT), a variant of ShadowPad. CVE-2023-3519 is a critical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in Citrix Application Delivery Controller (ADC) and Citrix Gateway appliances. Darktrace attributes the campaign to the state-sponsored threat actor Salt Typhoon with moderate confidence.

After gaining access, the threat actor pivoted from the compromised NetScaler Gateway to internal Citrix Virtual Delivery Agent (VDA) hosts within the organization's Machine Creation Services (MCS) subnet. To obscure their infrastructure and complicate attribution, the threat actor routed their initial access through an endpoint associated with the SoftEther virtual private network (VPN) service. Once inside the network, the threat actor deployed SnappyBee as a dynamic-link library (DLL) file to multiple internal Citrix VDA hosts, bundled alongside legitimate antivirus (AV) executables, such as Norton, Bkav, and IObit Malware Fighter, and executed it using DLL sideloading.

On May 28, 2025, Oasis Security published a technical blog detailing a flaw in Microsoft’s OneDrive File Picker. File Picker is a web component that allows applications to access, upload, and download files from a user’s OneDrive storage via OAuth authorization. File Picker (versions 6.0 to 7.2 using Implicit Flow and 8.0 using Microsoft Authentication Library) always requests the broad scopes Files.Read.All, Files.ReadWrite.All, and offline_access. As a result, even single-file upload consent silently grants apps full, persistent read and write access to the user’s entire OneDrive.

According to Oasis Security, web applications such as ChatGPT, Slack, Trello, ClickUp, and others that support OneDrive file uploads may unintentionally receive full read access to a user’s entire OneDrive account, even if a single file gets uploaded. Given the integration of OneDrive File Picker in numerous and diverse SaaS applications, the flaw is both widespread and trivially exploitable: a malicious app only needs to host the picker and then read the user's authorization token from localStorage or sessionStorage to enumerate or exfiltrate all files stored in the user's OneDrive account.

Oasis reported the flaw to Microsoft, which then notified vendors implementing OneDrive File Picker. At the time of writing, Microsoft has not yet issued a fix; however, per Oasis, Microsoft stated they are “considering future improvements, including more precise alignment between what OneDrive File Picker does and the access it requires.”

The flaw stems from the File Picker’s lack of fine-grained OAuth scopes. When a user authorizes a web application like ChatGPT or Slack to upload a file via OneDrive, the File Picker requests full read (and in some cases write) access to the entire OneDrive directory. This is due to the overly broad predefined scope permissions available in Microsoft Graph that cannot be customized for single-file access scenarios. Therefore, instead of exclusively granting access to a specific file, the OAuth tokens issued through the File Picker grant access beyond the selected file, extending to the user’s entire OneDrive directory. These tokens often request the offline_access scope, allowing applications to retain access for extended periods beyond the user's session.

This design flaw increases the risk due to ambiguous consent prompts that suggest access remains limited to selected files; however, in reality, applications gain permissions without clear user awareness. In File Picker version 7.0, it requests both read and write permissions even in upload scenarios, and while version 8.0 delegates authentication to developers, it does not enforce narrower scopes. As a result, users may unknowingly expose sensitive data to third-party applications with far broader access than intended.

The second flaw stems from the insecure storage of sensitive authentication tokens, such as access and refresh tokens, particularly in older versions of the File Picker (6.0 to 7.2). These versions use the “Implicit Flow” authorization method, which exposes access tokens via URL fragments and stores them as plaintext in the browser’s localStorage, allowing malicious scripts or browser extensions to access them easily. In newer versions like 8.0, with authentication handled through Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL), developers often store tokens in sessionStorage without encryption or safeguards, leading to significant security risks. These insecure storage practices allow threat actors with access to the browser context to easily hijack tokens and gain full read access to the OneDrive account.

Based on reporting associated with the flaw, threat actors could exploit this flaw in at least two ways:

Malicious Web Pages: Threat actors could create a web page that uses the OneDrive File Picker and is embedded with malicious JavaScript. When users visit that page and authorize OneDrive File Picker, the attacker’s JavaScript can retrieve the OAuth token from localStorage or sessionStorage, granting full read access to files stored in the user’s OneDrive.

Compromise Legitimate Web Pages: Threat actors could seek to identify vulnerable, legitimate web pages that implement OneDrive File Picker. For example, web pages vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) could allow threat actors to inject malicious JavaScript into a trusted web application. Once the web page is compromised, threat actors can trigger the same OneDrive Picker Flow that waits for a user to consent to uploading at least one file, stealing their authorization token from localStorage or sessionStorage, and obtaining full read access to the user’s OneDrive.

In either exploit scenario, minimal user interaction is required. Given the widespread adoption of the OneDrive File Picker across numerous collaboration and productivity platforms, the flaw is common, as any web app that embeds the OneDrive File Picker in upload mode is impacted.

On February 12, 2025, Datadog Security Labs published a write-up detailing the "WhoAMI" attack, which targets a name confusion vulnerability affecting Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) used in Amazon Web Services (AWS) environments. AMI is a pre-configured virtual machine template used to launch Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances in AWS, containing the operating system, applications, and necessary configurations. EC2 is a scalable cloud computing service that provides virtual servers (instances) to run applications on AWS. According to Datadog Security Labs, which discovered the vulnerability in August 2024, threat actors can inject malicious AMIs into unsuspecting AWS accounts. Using the WhoAMI attack, threat actors can compromise a significant number of AWS environments, including those of major organizations. Notably, AWS itself had non-production systems vulnerable to this issue before implementing fixes. To mitigate this risk, AWS introduced the “Allowed AMIs” feature that allows users to restrict AMI selection to verified providers.

The vulnerability stems from improper filtering of AMI searches using the ec2:DescribeImages API. Many organizations and Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) tools, such as Terraform, dynamically search for the latest AMI matching a given name pattern. If the search query omits the "owners" attribute, AWS returns a list of AMIs from trusted and untrusted sources. Threat actors can exploit this design flaw by publishing a malicious AMI with a name that mimics an official one with a more recent timestamp, causing automated processes to select it. When used to launch EC2 instances, these malicious AMIs grant threat actors control over the victim’s cloud environment, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data theft, or further network compromise. According to Datadog, the flaw is not limited to Terraform; it also affects AWS command-line interface (CLI) commands and various programming languages, including Python, Go, and Bash scripts.

DataDog shared the following exploitation steps to execute arbitrary code within a victim’s AWS environment and gain unauthorized access to cloud resources:

Craft a custom AMI with embedded malicious payloads, such as a backdoor or data exfiltration mechanism.

Name the AMI similarly to a trusted one, ensuring it fits commonly used naming patterns (for example, ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-focal-20.04-amd64-server-*).

Publicly publish the AMI or share it with targeted AWS accounts.

Ensure it appears as the most recent AMI rather than the legitimate ones.

Trigger the victim to dynamically retrieve the AMI using a misconfigured script or IaC tool, such as Terraform, that fetches the latest AMI without specifying the owner.

Cause the victim to launch an EC2 instance using the compromised AMI, allowing the threat actor’s code to execute within the victim's cloud environment.

Establish persistence and control over the instance, enabling further exploitation such as credential theft, lateral movement, or data exfiltration.

On February 13, 2025, Datadog released whoAMI-scanner, an open-source tool designed to identify and flag instances using untrusted AMIs. Based on the repository, whoAMI-scanner requires an AWS profile to scan, a region, and a list of trusted AMI provider accounts. If no parameters are provided, it defaults to predefined settings. Once provided, whoAMI-scanner loads the AWS configuration, retrieves the caller's AWS account identity, and determines which AWS regions to scan. For each region, it queries running EC2 instances and extracts the AMI ID associated with each instance. whoAMI-scanner then checks these AMIs against a database of known AWS accounts, categorizing them as verified, self-hosted, allowed (if AWS's "Allowed AMIs" feature is enabled), or unverified. If whoAMI-scanner finds a public AMI from an unknown or untrusted source, it flags the AMI as potentially malicious. whoAMI-scanner generates a summary report displaying the status of all analyzed AMIs and warns users about unverified instances. If specified, whoAMI-scanner also writes to a CSV file. Finally, whoAMI-scanner informs operators about the status of AWS’s "Allowed AMIs" feature and recommends ways to secure their environments.

On October 2, 2025, GreyNoise published a report on a coordinated one-day surge of exploitation attempts against Grafana instances vulnerable to CVE-2021-43798, a path traversal flaw that enables arbitrary file reads on exposed systems. The activity, observed on September 28, 2025, involved 110 malicious IP addresses focusing on internet-accessible Grafana deployments in the United States, Slovakia, and Taiwan, highlighting how long-patched but widely deployed software in cloud and hybrid environments remains a high-value reconnaissance and initial access vector.

The attack chain centers on HTTP requests that exploit the CVE-2021-43798 path traversal vulnerability to read arbitrary files from Grafana servers. These servers, when internet-exposed, commonly reside on cloud infrastructure or act as monitoring frontends into cloud workloads. Successful exploitation can expose sensitive configuration or credential material, enabling follow-on actions such as service discovery, lateral movement into underlying cloud resources, or pivoting to other managed services. GreyNoise notes that Grafana vulnerabilities, including CVE-2021-43798, frequently appear in reconnaissance phases of multi-step exploit chains and large-scale server-side request forgery (SSRF) and exploit waves spanning diverse software ecosystems, underscoring their role as reusable building blocks in cloud-focused toolchains rather than isolated bugs.

The observed surge exhibited tightly aligned targeting and tooling: traffic from multiple countries followed a consistent destination ratio (roughly 3:1:1 across the US, Slovakia, and Taiwan), with converging Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and HTTP fingerprints indicating that different infrastructure sets, mainly originating from Bangladesh, with smaller clusters in China and Germany, were likely executing shared tasking or reusing a standard exploit kit and target list. In a cloud context, this pattern reflects how adversaries operationalize “resurgent” vulnerabilities. Attackers will integrate older vulnerabilities, such as CVE-2021-43798, and newer Grafana flaws into automated scanner and exploit frameworks to continuously scan large swaths of public cloud address spaces for unpatched instances. They will then selectively escalate from arbitrary file read to broader compromise when high-value telemetry or credentials are discovered.

Between February 26 and 27, 2025, Reuters and Recorded Future News reported that Belgium’s state security service (VSSE) was allegedly compromised by China-linked hackers via Barracuda Networks’s Email Security Gateway (ESG) appliance, prompting a federal judicial investigation and the agency’s decision to stop using Barracuda services. This activity is linked to earlier campaigns in which the China-nexus group UNC4841 exploited Barracuda ESG zero-day vulnerabilities to conduct long-term espionage against government and other high-value targets.

The primary exploitation path used malicious email attachments to trigger remote command injection in the ESG attachment-scanning component (CVE-2023-2868) on affected on-premise ESG versions. Crafted .tar archives abused Perl’s qx operator to execute arbitrary system commands on the gateway, which sits in front of mail servers and provides a privileged vantage point into email flows. UNC4841 then deployed custom malware, including SALTWATER (a trojanized Simple Mail Transfer Protocol [SMTP] module enabling command execution and tunneling), SEASPY (a backdoor masquerading as BarracudaMailService triggered by “magic packets”), and SEASIDE (a Lua module that turns SMTP HELO/EHLO data into reverse shells), to turn ESGs into persistent access and exfiltration nodes. Barracuda later disclosed follow-on exploitation of CVE-2023-7102 in the Spreadsheet::ParseExcel library, again via malicious Excel attachments, to reinstall updated SEASPY and SALTWATER variants after initial remediation.

Belgian reporting indicates that between 2021 and 2023, this Barracuda-focused attack chain enabled exfiltration of roughly 10% of VSSE’s email traffic via an external mail server used for communication with ministries, police, prosecutors, and foreign partners. Although the VSSE’s classified internal systems were reportedly not compromised, the same external server handled HR-related correspondence, exposing personal data for nearly half of VSSE’s staff and applicants and forcing identity document renewals for affected personnel. The case illustrates how the compromise of a single email security gateway product, through the iterative exploitation of Barracuda ESG parsing vulnerabilities and the deployment of bespoke implants, directly translated into strategic intelligence collection and the exposure of sensitive personnel data for a European intelligence service.

Cost of Impact: 4 (High)

Cloud abuse, particularly the abuse of compromised cloud assets, can incur high monetary, operational, and reputational costs for cloud tenants. Evidenced by reports throughout the past year, which are presented later in this section, threat actors often exploit compromised cloud infrastructure to maintain legitimacy within a victim's environment and perform costly operations, for which the tenant is held responsible. Additionally, in instances where threat actors register managed cloud services and abuse them in malicious activities, the providers may assume adverse impacts on their reputation.

Commonality: 4 (High)

Cloud abuse is a broad threat that originates from both compromised legitimate infrastructure and infrastructure controlled by threat actors. Based on the evidence presented in this report, threat actors are identifying and developing new methods to exploit legitimate cloud services for activities such as malware hosting, C2 hosting, and data exfiltration.

Evolution Potential: 5 (Severe)

Cloud abuse events reported within the past year demonstrate that threat actors are increasingly abusing cloud services as part of their C2 infrastructure and to host and deliver malicious payloads. The methods threat actors employ to perform these actions have also evolved, demonstrating that threat actors are actively identifying new ways to abuse cloud services.

Effort to Perform: 1 (Minimal)

Threat actors can easily register legitimate cloud services, which can then be abused for malicious purposes. Many cloud service providers require only an email address and a payment method to register for their services. Additionally, compromised victim cloud infrastructure can be easily abused by a threat actor as a result of broader cloud environment compromise.

Cloud abuse refers to the use of legitimate cloud services and infrastructure by a threat actor to perform malicious actions. This threat can generally be categorized into two main groups of activity: the abuse of threat actor-controlled cloud assets and the abuse of compromised victim cloud assets.

Within the past year, Insikt Group has noted that the abuse of compromised victim cloud assets is more prominently reported, with reporting, discussed further in the Examples in the Wild section, demonstrating that threat actors will commonly enroll in cloud services or develop cloud infrastructure with malicious intentions (mainly hosting malware, phishing websites or websites embedded with malicious artifacts, or C2 infrastructure, or deriving capabilities from cloud services, such as LLM services).

Insikt Group notes that, in contrast to previous iterations of this report, there has been little publicly accessible evidence within the past year, indicating either an uptick or persistence of common compromised victim cloud abuse behaviors, such as cryptojacking and business email compromise (BEC), among others.

Threat actors will likely continue to register and abuse cloud services and infrastructure to perform malicious actions.

As discussed earlier in this section, threat actors continue to identify new products and methods for abuse, demonstrating both their creativity in achieving malicious goals and the various cloud products they can procure and exploit to accomplish these goals. Threat actors recognize the anonymity these products provide, compared to similar traditional solutions, which make malicious traffic appear benign to most security products.

Threat actors will likely continue to abuse compromised cloud services during an attack chain rather than compute services that enable customized code execution, as abusing compromised victim cloud services can be financially lucrative or a means for threat actors to propagate during an attack. Additionally, over the past year, threat actors have demonstrated an interest in targeting cloud-based LLMs for abuse. This behavior is indicative of an evolution for both threat actor TTPs and victimology and signals that other service types may also be targeted in the future. It further indicates that threat actors prefer to abuse cloud resources rather than execute custom code in cloud environments to achieve malicious goals.

Mitigations and Detections

Because there are two distinct domains associated with cloud abuse, they are discussed separately below. Figure 4 demonstrates a hypothetical attack chain associated with threat actor-registered cloud abuse, while Figure 5 demonstrates a hypothetical attack chain associated with threat actor abuse of compromised victim cloud services. Throughout these visuals, Insikt Group has identified parts of the attack chain where defenders can most efficiently hunt for and mitigate behaviors associated with both domains of cloud abuse.

① Cloud Infrastructure Abused for Malware HostingThreat actors will host malicious assets and tools within their own cloud infrastructure, allowing them to be loaded into victim environments during an attack. While these assets may not always be directly identifiable at the perimeter of a threat actor’s infrastructure, some threat actors may expose web servers or file systems that contain the malicious assets, allowing them to be programmatically accessed.

Defenders can mitigate these threats in the following ways:

Implement stateful packet analysis and identify requests that are typical of executable file downloads. This could include HTTP POST requests with common executable suffixes, or unexpected connections implementing standard file transfer protocols or remote-access protocols.

Perform routine malware scans of local filesystems, particularly targeting directories where threat actors are known to stage malware, such as the temp and root directories.

Employ IDS and IPS technologies and keep their detection capabilities up to date via indicator streaming and malware intelligence products.

② Exfiltration to Attacker-Controlled Cloud LocationsOver the past year, threat actors have consistently demonstrated the use of cloud services and infrastructure as targets for exfiltration during attacks. Similar to the threat discussed above, threat actors use these services for exfiltration because the traffic generated during exfiltration appears benign and can, therefore, blend into common network traffic patterns.

Although this exfiltration technique poses detection and mitigation issues due to the benign nature of this traffic, there are methods for detecting and mitigating this threat, which are included below:

Monitor network activity for high-volume outbound POST requests to a source that is either unknown or untrusted.

Compare telemetry destined for cloud infrastructure against net flow data for your environment and determine whether requests to specific cloud services are common; requests to uncommon services may be indicative of exfiltration.

In instances where threat actors are exfiltrating data from a cloud environment, they have been known to exploit cloud service functions to establish exfiltration channels rather than use traditional methods of exfiltration. To detect and mitigate this threat, the following actions may be taken:

Identify the establishment of new, unexpected workflows and systems in cloud environments capable of backing up data to a remote cloud storage system. This activity may also be accompanied by the establishment of new service accounts and identity and access management (IAM) roles.

Identify cloud accounts that attempt to access data without the requisite permissions.

Identify the creation or modification of virtual private cloud (VPC) systems and cloud firewall technologies.

① Cloud Service Abuse

Threat actors may abuse cloud services to perform resource-intensive operations without incurring the associated costs and to make malicious operations more difficult to attribute to themselves. Ways of detecting and mitigating these threats are discussed below:

Set metrics-based alerts that trigger when a specific threshold is reached for certain resources. Alerts can be set for metrics such as memory use in compute instances and when a certain percentage of queries have been made from a total monthly allowance. Alerts should be designed after a baseline of expected activity is set, so that they can more accurately assist in identifying suspicious activity.

Ensure that roles and permissions are applied to user accounts, adhering to the principle of least privilege, to ensure that, even in instances where cloud environments are breached, access to restricted services is minimized, or that the permissions a threat actor has when accessing services are limited.

Implement IAM logging and behavioral analysis services to identify unusual account behavior. Specifically, identify instances in which a cloud account is observed creating new cloud assets, using cloud services that are not frequently used, or modifying existing cloud assets.

Monitor for unusual requests or interactions between cloud services, especially where no existing inter-service workflow exists.

② Abuse for On-Premises Pivot

Threat actors will exploit compromised cloud services to pivot into on-premises workstations and infrastructure, often by masquerading as legitimate cloud users or services, or by leveraging existing connections between the cloud environment and these assets. Methods to detect and mitigate this threat include the following:

Monitor dedicated networking components, such as AWS Direct Connect and Azure ExpressRoute, for modifications and errors, especially those related to outbound traffic. Irregularities logged by these components may indicate malicious activity.

Ensure that cloud networking components, such as VPCs and cloud firewalls, are properly configured.

Ensure that authentication mechanisms, both to and from cloud environments, are properly configured.

Monitor for the abuse of mailing systems and implement training solutions associated with business email compromise (BEC) attacks. Warn personnel of the dangers of trusting internal communications without first verifying that the communication is ordinary and expected and that any attachments do not include malicious content.

③ Abuse for External Propagation

Similar to the above, threat actors will also attempt to abuse cloud services to infect additional targets while masquerading as a member of the organization that owns a victimized cloud environment. Ways that this behavior can be detected and mitigated are discussed below:

Monitor instances of cloud-based mailing services where accounts are creating outbound mail at an increased volume that is destined for unknown recipients.

As mentioned above, identify the creation of unexpected cloud assets that can be made publicly available, such as files that are accessible to the public or webpages hosted on external-facing cloud infrastructure.

Insikt Group curated a list of events published within the past year that demonstrate the threats posed by cloud abuse. These events are discussed below.

On July 10, 2025, CERT-UA reported that the Russian state-sponsored threat group APT28 (also known as UAC-0001) had conducted spearphishing attacks against Ukrainian government agencies and entities in the defense and security sectors. The campaign involved the deployment of a new Python-based infostealer dubbed LameHug, representing the first publicly documented case of malware integrating an LLM to dynamically generate commands during runtime.

The campaign began with emails impersonating a government ministry and delivering ZIP archives named Appendix.pdf.zip or Dodatok.pdf.zip. These contained .pif executables disguised as PDFs, packed with PyInstaller to execute LameHug in memory. The malware used a hijacked email account (boroda70@meta[.]ua) to deliver payloads and leveraged compromised infrastructure, including the domain stayathomeclasses[.]com and IP address 144[.]126[.]202[.]227, for C2 and exfiltration activities.

LameHug accessed Alibaba Cloud's Qwen 2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct LLM via Hugging Face API to generate system commands based on Base64-encoded prompts. This allowed it to evade static detection signatures and tailor its execution to victim environments in real time. Commands generated by the LLM performed reconnaissance using native Windows utilities, including systeminfo, wmic, tasklist, ipconfig, and dsquery. The collected data was stored locally at %PROGRAMDATA%\info\info.txt, and document files from user directories were staged for exfiltration.

The two LameHug variants used different exfiltration methods: one sent data via HTTP POST to a compromised website, while the other leveraged Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) with hard-coded credentials. Both methods exfiltrated sensitive files like Office documents and system reconnaissance outputs. Notably, the malware did not establish persistence, aligning with “smash-and-grab” tactics focused on short-lived espionage operations.

On February 24, 2025, cybersecurity firm Kaspersky published a report detailing Operation SalmonSlalom, a multi-stage campaign that delivers the FatalRAT backdoor to industrial organizations in the APAC region. The operation primarily targets Chinese-speaking users in the manufacturing, telecommunications, and energy sectors across Taiwan, Malaysia, China, Japan, the Philippines, and other countries in the Asia-Pacific region. The threat actors heavily rely on legitimate cloud services, specifically Youdao Cloud Notes and Tencent’s MyQcloud content delivery network (CDN)/object storage, to host configuration data and payloads, enabling them to rotate their infrastructure and rapidly blend into regular traffic.

The attack chain begins with phishing emails and WeChat or Telegram messages that deliver ZIP archives masquerading as tax documents to employees at targeted industrial organizations. These archives contain a packed first-stage loader (using packers such as UPX, AsProtect, or NSPack) that contacts Youdao Cloud Notes to obtain an updated list of URLs hosting the second-stage components, Before.dll (configurator) and Fangao.dll (loader). Before.dll fetches additional configuration from Youdao-hosted notes, including C2 and payload URLs, writes this data to a local configuration file, and sends basic system profiling data to the C2. Fangao.dll then reads this configuration, performs environment checks (it looks for system language and file paths, and ensures the time zone is set to “UTC+8”) to ensure it is running on a victim system. If successful, it downloads and decrypts FatalRAT.

From there, the campaign uses a mix of GUI-driven Group Policy abuse and DLL sideloading to establish persistence and deliver FatalRAT from cloud infrastructure. Fangao.dll automates the Windows Group Policy Editor to add a logon script that launches a trojanized media player binary, thereby avoiding direct registry modification and reducing detection. It then leverages a legitimate driver utility (DriverAssistant) for DLL sideloading, placing a malicious loader DLL that contacts MyQcloud-hosted content to download FatalRAT. Once active, FatalRAT conducts reconnaissance, anti-VM checks, and establishes its own persistence, then supports keylogging, file exfiltration, command execution, Server Message Block (SMB) brute forcing for lateral movement, optional destructive actions (such as MBR overwrites), and deployment of remote access tools like UltraViewer and AnyDesk to extend interactive control over compromised industrial networks.

On May 29, 2025, Insikt Group published a Validated Intelligence Event (VIE) summarizing Google Threat Intelligence Group’s (GTIG) analysis of a cyber-espionage campaign conducted by APT41, a Chinese state-sponsored threat actor. According to GTIG, the campaign, first observed in October 2024, uses a multi-stage malware framework called TOUGHPROGRESS that exploits Google Calendar as a covert channel for C2. The campaign targets global government organizations through a phishing scheme that uses a compromised government website.

Based on Mandiant’s analysis, APT41 sends spearphishing emails containing a link to a ZIP archive named 出境海關申報清單.zip, hosted on a compromised government website. This archive includes a shortcut file (LNK) named 申報物品清單.pdf.lnk. It is disguised as a PDF using the double-file extension technique, along with a directory hosting seven image files. Among those seemingly benign image files, 6.jpg contains an encrypted payload, and 7.jpg is a DLL that decrypts and launches the payload. When a victim opens the LNK file, it executes the DLL, deletes itself to avoid detection, and opens a decoy PDF resembling a customs declaration document to divert suspicion.

The decrypted payload initiates the following three-stage execution process:

PLUSDROP: This stage decrypts and loads the next module into memory, enabling a stealthy, fileless progression.

PLUSINJECT: This stage hijacks a legitimate Windows process (svchost.exe) via process hollowing to execute the final payload, TOUGHPROGRESS.

TOUGHPROGRESS: This stage performs the core functionality on the compromised host. It employs advanced evasion techniques including register-based indirect calls, dynamic control-flow obfuscation, and 64-bit arithmetic overflows. It embeds shellcode within the .pdata section of its code, decrypts it with a hard-coded sixteen-byte XOR key, and decompresses it using the Lempel-Ziv NT version 1 (LZNT1) algorithm.

Once activated on a compromised system, TOUGHPROGRESS establishes threat actor-controlled C2 communication using Google Calendar. It creates zero-duration calendar events to exfiltrate data and polls the calendar for encrypted threat actor commands scheduled on July 30 and 31, 2023. TOUGHPROGRESS decrypts these commands using a two-layer XOR scheme that combines a static ten-byte key with a dynamic four-byte key generated for each message. After executing the commands, TOUGHPROGRESS encrypts the results and uploads them to new calendar events, establishing full-duplex communication over a legitimate platform.

According to the report, Mandiant and GTIG disrupted APT41’s infrastructure by revoking access to the malicious Workspace projects and blocking associated URLs, such as word[.]msapp[.]workers[.]dev, resource[.]infinityfreeapp[.]com, and hxxps://my5353[.]com/nWyTf, through Google Safe Browsing.

On March 1, 2025, Trend Micro Research reported a surge in activity related to ACR Stealer, accompanied by a new TTP update. ACR Stealer is a malware-as-a-service (MaaS) information stealer operated by a threat actor named “SheldIO”. According to Trend Micro Research, ACR Stealer uses advanced dead-drop resolvers to conceal its C2 infrastructure by leveraging legitimate platforms, such as Steam and Google Docs. Additionally, Trend Micro Research reported active infection in multiple countries, including the United States, Canada, Germany, France, the Czech Republic (Czechia), Brazil, Peru, Sweden, Finland, and Indonesia over the past 30 days.

Based on Trend Micro Research’s analysis, threat actors distribute ACR Stealer through cracked software downloads and use Cloudflare Web Application Firewall (WAF) to protect their distribution domains from detection. Once executed, ACR Stealer performs the following actions on a victim’s machine:

Collects sensitive data from browsers, email clients, and cryptocurrency wallets

Steals login credentials, financial information, system information, and personally identifiable information (PII)

Captures clipboard data

Harvests session tokens

Encodes its C2 domains using Base64 to evade detection

Exfiltrates stolen data over C2 channels using trusted web services to bypass security controls

On February 27, 2025, Trend Micro published a report describing a multi-stage machine learning supply-chain attack that abuses cloud-based AI services, specifically Amazon SageMaker and Amazon Bedrock, to compromise LLM-driven applications. The source highlights that misconfigurations, over-privileged roles, and unvetted third-party ML components enable an attacker to move from a single exposed SageMaker notebook in a development account to complete control over Bedrock-based LLM workflows, guardrails, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-backed knowledge bases in production.

The attack begins in the developer AWS account, where a SageMaker notebook instance with direct internet access and a default execution role is used by developers to install third-party extensions. The attacker publishes a malicious Python package that a developer installs and runs within that notebook, thereby opening a reverse shell to the attacker and granting them command execution on the ML workstation. From there, the attacker enumerates SageMaker and IAM resources via AWS CLI, discovers that the notebook’s role has powerful SageMaker and iam:PassRole permissions, and uses sagemaker:CreateNotebookInstance plus sagemaker:CreatePresignedNotebookInstanceUrl to create a new notebook bound to an administrative role. With this privilege escalation, the attacker gains effective control of the developer account and leverages CloudTrail logs to identify and assume a cross-account Bedrock role in the production account via sts:AssumeRole, bridging directly into the LLM-serving environment.

Once in the production account, the attacker abuses Bedrock Guardrails and downstream automation to weaponize LLM interactions. First, they update a guardrail attached to a Bedrock conversational agent so that prompts containing words like “How” or “What” are blocked and replaced with a malicious block message that instructs users to download a PDF from an attacker-controlled URL, using the LLM chat interface to deliver malware through otherwise “safety” infrastructure.

In a closely related variant, the attacker targets a code-generation model whose outputs are executed by an AWS Lambda function; they poison the guardrail’s block message with Python code that, when passed downstream and executed, exfiltrates the Lambda role’s credentials to an attacker-controlled IP, granting the adversary complete control over the LLM application’s business logic layer. With those cloud credentials, the attacker enumerates Bedrock agents, knowledge bases, and data sources, repoints the RAG knowledge base to an attacker-controlled Simple Storage Service (S3) bucket to poison LLM responses with tampered content, and finally uses S3 access (for example, via aws s3 sync) to exfiltrate sensitive inference data, including user prompts and proprietary information driving the LLM’s behavior.

Cost of Impact: 5 (Severe)

Victims of cloud ransomware attacks incur high costs monetarily, operationally, and reputationally. Even when victims refuse to negotiate, critical data and systems are effectively rendered useless depending on the method used to deny access to these assets.

Commonality: 3 (Moderate)

Based on a comparison of cloud ransomware events observed throughout the past year to previous reporting, cloud ransomware events continue to be monitored periodically, but they are not represented in high volumes.

Evolution Potential: 4 (High)

Threat actors have demonstrated in the past year that they are continuously identifying novel methods to perform cloud ransomware attacks. While the majority of these attacks still rely on threat actors’ use of native cloud services to perform the attacks, the methods they employ (and the theoretical methods threat researchers have reported) indicate that additional attack methods will likely surface in the future.

Effort to Perform: 4 (High)

Similar to Insikt Group’s determinations in previous reporting, threat actors’ reliance on cloud services to perform cloud ransomware operations ensures that an in-depth knowledge of cloud service provider (CSP) environments will remain necessary to perform cloud ransomware attacks.

Cloud ransomware operations exploit trusted access to cloud environments to encrypt cloud assets or render them inaccessible; this includes object storage, virtual disks, databases, and backups. Instead of deploying large numbers of binaries, threat actors use compromised accounts, roles, tokens, and keys to change encryption settings, rotate or destroy key material, or mass-modify stored data through cloud APIs and consoles. This keeps activity primarily within typical administrative paths and forces defenders to rely on behavioral indicators, such as unusual spikes in encryption, snapshot changes, or bulk storage operations.

Cloud ransomware will continue to rely on native cloud services to rapidly encrypt large volumes of cloud data or render them inaccessible.

Due to the managed nature of CSP environments, which were the only targets identified in cloud ransomware reporting during the past year, threat actors must rely on native services to encrypt or destroy data during a cloud ransomware campaign. Since these native services provide threat actors with the functionality needed to perform destructive actions against targeted assets, threat actors will also continue to need privileged access within victim cloud environments to perform cloud ransomware attacks effectively.

Mitigations and Detections

Figure 7 illustrates a hypothetical cloud ransomware attack chain and identifies parts of the attack chain where defenders can most efficiently hunt for and mitigate behaviors associated with it.

① Threat Actor Access to Victim Cloud Environment

In all events observed throughout the past year, threat actors had to first gain trusted access to the victim environment. This access, which grants the threat actor heightened privileges within the environment, is necessary to perform cloud ransomware attacks, since cloud ransomware attack chains rely on cloud service abuse for encryption, exfiltration, and persistence actions later.

Mitigation and hunting strategies for this behavior are discussed in the section titled Credential Abuse, Account Takeover, and Unauthorized Access.② Discovery to Support Cloud Ransomware Activities

After initial access is established, threat actors will profile the cloud environment, performing discovery to identify assets for encryption and services that can be abused to support functions necessary for the cloud ransomware attack to succeed.

Common mitigation and threat hunting capabilities for this behavior include the following:

Ensure that only tightly scoped roles have “list,” “describe,” and metadata-read permissions.

Segment business-critical data and services into separate accounts, projects, or subscriptions so that compromise of a single identity does not enable broad discovery across the environment.

Monitor cloud audit logs for broad or unusual enumeration patterns (such as bulk listing of storage, compute, identities, or security settings) and alert when they deviate from normal administrative baselines.

Limit who can view or query security coverage (EDR, logging, backup, and monitoring deployments) and alert on attempts to inventory or probe those protections.

Treat synchronization and integration components (identity sync, directory connectors, CI/CD systems, gateways) as high-value assets, restricting interactive access and monitoring them for discovery tooling or large-scale queries.

Constrain service and automation accounts to narrowly defined scopes and non-interactive use, and detect mass directory or graph-style enumeration from any identity.

Apply strong governance and approvals on any privilege escalation or “elevate access” mechanisms, and closely monitor for broad discovery activity that follows a privilege increase.

Regularly review and reduce broad read-only or viewer roles that span many resources or tenants, replacing them with granular, task-specific permissions.

③ Cloud Service Abuse for Encryption or Denial of Access

Based on the events discussed later in this section, threat actors rely on native cloud services to conduct the action encryption of cloud assets or to deny users access to these assets.

Due to the fact that the methods Insikt Group observed only affected AWS and Azure environments, specific mitigation and hunting suggestions for each platform are shown below:

Require S3 bucket versioning, Object Lock (preferably in compliance mode), and MFA Delete on business-critical buckets so that malicious encryption or deletion does not permanently deny access.

Use AWS Organizations service control policies (SCPs) and S3 bucket policies to block use of SSE-C (server-side encryption with customer-provided keys) on critical data (deny requests with x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm) and require SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS (Key Management Service) with organization-controlled keys.

Enforce that S3 encryption uses AWS KMS customer-managed keys (CMKs) in tightly controlled accounts with key policies that application roles cannot modify, preventing attackers from swapping or monopolizing encryption keys.

Configure immutable, cross-account S3 replication to backup buckets in a separate AWS account where production roles lack overwrite or delete permissions, preserving recovery options after in-place encryption or mass delete.

Restrict DeleteObject, DeleteBucket, PutBucketVersioning, PutObjectRetention, and related destructive S3 permissions to a minimal set of break-glass roles, with MFA required for use.

Monitor and alert on sudden changes to bucket encryption settings (especially bulk enabling of SSE-C or mass object re-encryption) as indicators of in-progress cloud-native ransomware.

Detect and alert on high-volume S3 delete operations or complete bucket wipes within short time windows, treating these as access-denial events requiring immediate response.

Ensure S3 bucket versioning and long-retention delete marker policies are enabled so that object deletions can be rolled back and do not equate to permanent data loss.

Maintain offline or out-of-band backups (for example, periodic exports to storage outside AWS control) so that even if S3 data and its versions are encrypted or destroyed, recovery remains possible.

Restrict the use of Microsoft.Authorization/elevateAccess/action and require Privileged Identity Management with approvals and limited durations, so attackers cannot easily obtain subscription-wide Owner rights for destructive actions.

Separate Azure Key Vault administration from storage and backup administration, ensuring the same identities cannot both control encryption keys and delete or reconfigure the storage protected by those keys.

Enforce Key Vault soft delete and purge protection for all keys used by storage encryption scopes so that deleting a key cannot permanently prevent decryption.

Apply Azure Policy to constrain encryption scopes so that storage accounts can only use keys from approved Key Vaults, and block ad hoc changes to key Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) or encryption scopes on production storage.

Place critical backups, Recovery Services Vaults, and long-term retention stores in dedicated subscriptions or management groups with independent resource locks and immutability controls that production Owners cannot remove.

Enable and monitor soft delete and retention for storage accounts, blobs, snapshots, and backup items so that deletion does not immediately equate to access denial.

Alert on large-scale deletion of VM snapshots, Restore Point Collections, storage accounts, and backup containers, mainly when such activity follows privilege escalation or changes to encryption scopes or keys.

Implement cross-region or cross-tenant backup strategies where restore rights are held by a separate, highly restricted set of identities, preventing the same compromised accounts from both encrypting production and destroying backups.

Use Conditional Access, strong MFA, and device restrictions for administrative access to the Azure portal and management APIs, limiting attackers’ ability to execute tenant-wide encryption and deletion operations once credentials are stolen.

④ Establishment of Exfiltration and Persistence Channels

Before encryption or deletion actions, threat actors will often attempt to establish channels between the victim environment and their own infrastructure that will be used to exfiltrate the data they are making inaccessible to support double extortion. Additionally, either before or after the encryption or deletion of data, threat actors will establish a persistence channel, which will be used to restore access to the compromised data and, in some instances, maintain communications with the victim for negotiation purposes.

Common mitigation and threat hunting capabilities for this behavior include the following:

Enforce least-privilege read access to data stores so only narrowly scoped identities can download or list large volumes of sensitive data.

Implement strict egress controls for workloads handling sensitive information so outbound traffic to the internet or untrusted networks is tightly filtered and observable.

Prefer private or service-specific network endpoints for data access and disable direct public access so exfiltration must traverse monitored, controlled paths.

Monitor for abnormal bulk download or data-transfer activity from cloud storage and databases, especially when initiated by identities or locations that do not typically perform such operations.

Use policies to restrict the creation of new cross-account or cross-tenant data sharing, replication, or peering links, and require review and approval for any new trust or data-movement relationship.

Rely on short-lived, automatically rotated credentials (tokens, role assumptions) instead of long-lived keys, and rapidly revoke or rotate any credentials suspected of compromise to disrupt ongoing exfiltration channels.

Restrict who can create or modify federated identity and SSO configurations, and require approvals and logging for any new trust relationships to prevent attackers from creating identity-based persistence.

Regularly audit identity providers for unexpected or unused federated domains, external trusts, or custom token rules, and remove any configuration not explicitly required for business purposes.

Separate duties so no single administrator identity can both manage federation and trust configurations and administer high-value data resources, reducing the chance of durable, identity-agnostic persistence for ransomware operations.

Insikt Group curated a list of events published during 2025 that demonstrate the threats posed by cloud ransomware attacks. These events are discussed below.

On November 18, 2025, Trend Micro’s Trend Research team published a report examining how ransomware operators are shifting from traditional on-premises encryption malware to cloud-centric techniques that abuse native AWS capabilities, with a particular focus on real-world S3 ransomware behaviors. The report highlights that attackers increasingly rely on misconfigured permissions and stolen IAM credentials to gain write-level access to S3 buckets, enumerate business-critical storage, and then make data irrecoverable (without necessarily deploying conventional binaries).

One observed technique centers on the threat actor Codefinger, who used S3 server-side encryption with customer-provided keys (SSE-C) to ransom S3 data. After obtaining write-level access via leaked IAM role credentials or a compromised AWS account, the threat actor enumerates S3 buckets to find high-value targets lacking protective features such as versioning, object lock, and MFA Delete. They then initiate SSE-C by supplying a locally stored AES-256 key through the x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm mechanism (via REST API/HTTP or AWS SDKs), causing AWS to encrypt all affected objects without ever retaining the key itself, only a hash-based method authentication code (HMAC) in CloudTrail that cannot be used for decryption. Once encryption is complete, a ransom note is placed in the bucket, leaving both the customer and AWS unable to restore access without the attacker’s key.

The Bling Libra threat actor also leveraged stolen AWS credentials to access S3, exfiltrated bucket contents to attacker-controlled infrastructure, and then deleted the data or entire bucket, sometimes leaving ransom notes in the original bucket or in newly created, ransom-branded buckets. Trend Micro notes this exfiltration-and-deletion model is particularly likely in practice because it is operationally simple and makes recovery impossible if versioning or backups are absent. Consistent with these techniques, Trend Vision One telemetry has recorded CloudTrail-based behaviors associated with S3 ransomware campaigns, including S3 bucket enumeration, bulk download followed by deletion, ransom note uploads, and IAM policy or administrative changes that expand privileges over S3 resources, all of which contribute to effective cloud-native ransomware operations against AWS environments.

On August 27, 2025, Microsoft Threat Intelligence published a report detailing how the financially motivated threat actor Storm-0501 has shifted from traditional endpoint encryption to cloud-based ransomware operations targeting hybrid environments that integrate on-premises Active Directory, Microsoft Entra ID, and Azure resources. The report describes a campaign against a large multi-subsidiary enterprise where Storm-0501 used preexisting domain administrator access to move from fragmented on-premises coverage into multiple Entra ID tenants, gained Global Administrator rights, and then used only native cloud capabilities for data theft, destruction, and encryption before extorting the victim.

On-premises activity began from an already-compromised Active Directory domain where only part of the environment was protected by Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. Storm-0501 enumerated security coverage using commands such as sc query sense and sc query windefend, then used Evil-WinRM from an unenrolled Entra Connect Sync server to laterally move and tunnel to additional systems. The threat actor performed DCSync against domain controllers to obtain credential material and then abused multiple Entra Connect Sync servers and their Directory Synchronization Accounts to enumerate identities and resources across more than one Entra ID tenant using AzureHound. They encountered blocked sign-in attempts when Conditional Access and MFA were enforced on privileged accounts.

Storm-0501 escalated privileges in the cloud by identifying a synced non-human account with the Global Administrator role that lacked MFA, resetting its on-premises password, and relying on Password-Hash Synchronization to propagate the new password to Entra ID, then registering attacker-controlled MFA to satisfy Conditional Access. Because Azure portal access required Microsoft Entra hybrid-joined devices, the actor moved laterally until successfully logging into the portal from a hybrid-joined server. With Global Administrator permissions, Storm-0501 created a malicious federated trust to an attacker-controlled tenant using AADInternals and a custom certificate, enabling the forging of Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) tokens. This allowed the attacker to impersonate arbitrary users based on ImmutableId and inherit their roles, establishing durable, identity-agnostic persistence in the victim tenant.

From this Entra ID foothold, Storm-0501 elevated access in Azure by invoking Microsoft.Authorization/elevateAccess/action to gain User Access Administrator and then assigning themselves Owner across all subscriptions, enabling complete control of Azure Storage, virtual machines, and backup infrastructure. The actor discovered storage accounts, snapshots, Restore Point Collections, and Recovery Services Vault configurations; exposed internal storage accounts to the internet; retrieved storage access keys; and exfiltrated data at scale using AzCopy to attacker-controlled cloud storage. They then deleted VM snapshots, Restore Point Collections, storage accounts, and backup containers, removing resource locks and immutability policies as necessary. For residual storage accounts, they configured encryption scopes to use an attacker-controlled Azure Key Vault key before deleting that key, resulting in cloud-based encryption for impact. Following exfiltration and destructive actions, Storm-0501 used compromised identities to contact the victim via Microsoft Teams and deliver ransom demands.

Credential Abuse, Account Takeover, and Unauthorized Access

Cost of Impact: 4 (High)

This threat involves threat actors gaining privileged access to cloud environments. While this privileged access does not inherently ensure that threat actors are going to be able to perform malicious actions within a cloud environment, the capabilities that this access affords a threat actor are potentially highly damaging.

Commonality: 5 (Severe)

Nearly all of the events discussed in this report include the abuse of valid credentials at some point in their attack chain. Due to the value of valid cloud authentication materials and their necessity to perform restricted access in cloud environments, these materials will likely be observed in most attacks against cloud environments.

Evolution Potential: 1 (Minimal)

The methods that allow unauthorized access are rigid. To perform these methods, threat actors must abuse authentication materials only in the way they are intended to be used; therefore, there is little potential for threat actors to innovate on these attack methods.

Effort to Perform: 1 (Minimal)

For the same reason that the complexity of this threat will likely never evolve, the effort to perform related attacks will similarly remain low. Threat actors have access to a myriad of solutions for gathering valid credentials, which can then be used directly for authentication to and within cloud environments.

Threat actors must be able to gain access to an environment before they can pursue or achieve their overarching goals. Often, as is demonstrated by the events discussed in this section, threat actors will obtain and abuse legitimate credentials to gain this access.

One of the most common ways threat actors achieve unauthorized access is by abusing valid credentials associated with a trusted entity within the cloud environment. These valid credentials provide inherent permissions or grant access within the context of the victim's environment through account takeover. There are multiple ways that threat actors are capable of obtaining valid credentials: password spray and stuffing attacks, phishing and adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) or man-in-the-browser (MitB) attacks, and by purchasing valid credentials from an initial access broker (IAB), among other methods.

The term “valid credentials” is often used synonymously with username and password combinations; however, threat actors have demonstrated that other forms of authentication material can be used to gain access to or within cloud environments. Secret keys and tokens generated by and stored within cloud environments can also be used to authenticate with specific cloud services, allowing threat actors to collect data from the environment or perform otherwise unauthorized actions while masquerading as a legitimate entity. Additionally, username and password combinations are often not enough for breaching a cloud environment, and threat actors must intercept MFA codes to gain access.

Valid credentials are also highly valued by threat actors, as they often facilitate account takeover. Once a threat actor has gained access to a valid account trusted by a victim's cloud environment, they can masquerade as that account, making their actions within the environment appear legitimate. Often, the only way for defenders to detect that an account has been compromised is through behavioral indicators, which may not immediately alert defenders to the active risk in their environment, whether at the perimeter of a cloud environment or internally.

Threat actors will continue to implement stolen valid credentials materials to gain access to cloud environments for the foreseeable future. Additionally, threat actors will continue to execute campaigns for gathering valid credentials that can be used in future attacks against cloud environments. As mentioned above, valid accounts are highly valued by threat actors for their ability to grant access to cloud environments, as well as their capacity to mask malicious activities and represent them as benign events.

Mitigations and Detections

Figure 9 illustrates a hypothetical attack chain that includes unauthorized access. Throughout this visual, Insikt Group has identified parts of the attack chain where defenders can most efficiently hunt for and mitigate behaviors associated with cloud abuse.

① Detecting Unauthorized Access at the Edge

Threat actors will leverage multiple methods to gain unauthorized access to a cloud environment. As such, being able to detect and mitigate these threats at the edge of a cloud environment is paramount to the environment’s security. Some methods for detecting unauthorized initial access to a cloud environment are described below:

Monitor cloud firewall, network, and IAM logs for a high volume of login requests made rapidly. Additionally, be highly aware of instances where many incorrect requests are made, followed by a successful response, and then no other responses. This behavior is almost always indicative of password spraying or credential stuffing attacks.

Compare cloud access logs against threat intelligence associated with known compromised credentials to determine if credentials known to be compromised were used to gain access to the cloud environment.

Identify instances of impossible travel, which occurs when a cloud user authenticates from two locations simultaneously, from two physical locations that are far apart from each other.

Compare the expected login behaviors associated with a user account with the most recent attempt; be mindful of the location of the attempt, the time of day, and what device was used for the attempt (if possible).

Additionally, these threats can be mitigated in the following ways:

Ensure that MFA mechanisms are implemented instead of 2FA, requiring users to authenticate with more artifacts than their credentials and a code provided by an authentication application.

Be mindful of phishing messaging and approach unexpected authentication requests with skepticism.

Enable rate limiting on authentication attempts.

Restrict what credentials can be used to perform API authentication.

② Unauthorized Access to Cloud Services and Resources

If a threat actor gains access to a cloud environment using compromised valid credentials, they will inherit the permissions granted to the account associated with those credentials. Threat actors will attempt to perform follow-on actions with these permissions after gaining access to a cloud environment, including determining the scope of their existing permissions. Some methods for hunting and mitigating actions threat actors can take at this stage are discussed below:

Monitor API logs for a burst of requests made by a single user shortly after authentication associated with describing cloud services and assets. Since the threat actor is profiling the environment and testing their capabilities, many of these requests will fail, a log artifact that can also aid in identifying this behavior.

Use behavioral analysis tools (some CSPs have this functionality built in natively) to identify accounts that access services and resources they do not commonly use.

Identify attempts made by a cloud user to create additional cloud accounts, roles, or infrastructure (such as a VPC, compute instance, or container), which may indicate a threat actor attempting to establish persistence.

Monitor and investigate compute instances that display abnormal hardware metrics, such as increased memory or GPU use statistics.

Ensure that the principle of least privilege is applied when granting privileges to cloud accounts to prevent data and services from being unintentionally available to a compromised account.

③ Accessing Linked Cloud Resources

This threat is closely tied to the Unauthorized Access threat discussed above, and its mitigations are similar. After gaining access to a cloud environment, threat actors will often attempt to propagate throughout it, gaining access to as many resources and artifacts as possible. Importantly, threat actors may also attempt to access parts of the cloud environment’s infrastructure hosted in other data centers or entirely different cloud environments owned and managed by the same entity.

As stated above, the mitigations and hunting strategies previously discussed in this section are also effective for identifying this behavior. Specifically, ensure that the principle of least privilege is followed and that cloud access logs are retained across all cloud environments owned and managed by a single unifying entity.

Insikt Group curated a list of events published within the past year that demonstrate the threats posed by unauthorized access, valid credential abuse, and account takeover. These events are discussed below.

On March 5, 2025, Microsoft Threat Intelligence published research on Silk Typhoon, a Chinese state espionage threat actor, detailing how the group targets IT service providers, identity and privileged access management platforms, and other supply-chain infrastructure to gain initial access and then systematically abuses stolen credentials, keys, and cloud identities to conduct espionage against downstream customers. After compromising edge devices or third-party providers, Silk Typhoon pivots by using valid but stolen authentication materials, rather than relying solely on bespoke malware, to move into customer environments and access data aligned with China-based strategic interests, US government policy, and sensitive legal and law enforcement information.

Silk Typhoon’s initial access phase combines exploitation of internet-facing vulnerabilities with direct credential abuse. The group rapidly operationalizes zero-day exploits against common edge appliances, including CVE-2025-0282 in Ivanti Pulse Connect VPN, CVE-2024-3400 in Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect Gateway, CVE-2023-3519 in Citrix NetScaler ADC/Gateway, and the Microsoft Exchange “ProxyLogon” chain (CVE-2021-26855, CVE-2021-26857, CVE-2021-26858, CVE-2021-27065) to gain system-level access to public-facing services. In parallel, Silk Typhoon performs password spray attacks and other password abuse techniques, harvesting leaked corporate passwords from public repositories such as GitHub and using them to authenticate directly to corporate accounts. These intrusions primarily target IT providers, identity management, privileged access management, and remote monitoring and management solutions, where a successful compromise yields powerful credentials and trust relationships that can be leveraged across multiple customers.

Once initial footholds are established, Silk Typhoon shifts to systematically stealing and reusing authentication materials to deepen access and reach downstream tenants. In supply-chain intrusions since late 2024, the threat actor has stolen API keys and credentials from privileged access management, cloud application providers, and cloud data management companies, then used those keys to authenticate into downstream customer tenants as an administrator, perform reconnaissance, collect data, reset default admin accounts, deploy web shells, create additional users, and clear logs to hide activity.

Within victim environments, Silk Typhoon dumps Active Directory, steals passwords and secrets from key vaults, and targets AADConnect and Entra Connect servers to obtain privileges that span both on-premises and cloud identity planes. The group then abuses legitimate cloud identities by compromising or creating service principals and OAuth applications with administrative permissions, adding their own credentials to already-consented applications, compromising multi-tenant applications, and developing new Entra ID applications named to blend in with the environment. Using these trusted identities, Silk Typhoon accesses Microsoft Graph and Exchange Web Services APIs to exfiltrate large volumes of email, OneDrive, and SharePoint data across multiple tenants.

On June 27, 2025, Information Security Media Group published a ReliaQuest-sourced teardown describing how Scattered Spider (aka Octo-Tempest/UNC3944) compromised a logistics firm by targeting the CFO, abusing valid credentials, and manipulating MFA and privileged password vaults to achieve and re-attempt access.

Attackers began by targeting C-suite personnel and collecting publicly available identity data for the CFO, including their date of birth and the last four digits of their Social Security number. They used this information against the company’s public-facing Oracle Cloud portal to confirm the CFO’s employee number and attempted to authenticate with stolen CFO credentials; these initial login attempts failed due to enforced MFA.

Next, Scattered Spider impersonated the CFO in a phone call to the IT help desk, presenting a plausible scenario that leveraged the previously gathered identity details. Help-desk staff were convinced to reset both the MFA device and credentials tied to the CFO’s account, effectively transferring control of a legitimate executive identity to the attackers and turning MFA into an enabler rather than a barrier. Using the now-compromised CFO account, the attackers accessed the environment via single sign-on and VMware Horizon virtual desktops, then used valid credentials to enumerate identities in Microsoft Entra ID, assign an Exchange administrator role to a compromised account, and access high-value services, including the company’s CyberArk privileged access vault and Snowflake data warehouse.

Inside the CyberArk vault, the threat actor used vaulted secrets associated with approximately 1,400 accounts to move through the environment with legitimate credentials, ultimately dumping the NTDS.DIT Active Directory database and accessing mailboxes belonging to the CISO and other senior staff. Even after defenders fully ejected the threat actor roughly 62 hours after initial breach, Scattered Spider continued attempting to regain access by logging in with passwords cracked from the previously stolen privileged account hashes; these later attempts used valid (but now protected) credentials and triggered MFA prompts, preventing reentry but demonstrating repeated credential-based access attempts.

On May 5, 2025, Elastic Security Labs published a report detailing how DPRK-linked TraderTraitor operators stole roughly 400,000 ETH from ByBit by abusing Safe{Wallet}’s AWS authentication. The report focuses on how attackers moved from a compromised Safe{Wallet} macOS developer workstation to authenticated access in Safe{Wallet}’s AWS account, and then used that cloud identity to tamper with the Safe{Wallet} frontend that ByBit approvers trusted for transaction validation.

The attack chain began with the compromise of “Developer1” at Safe{Wallet} through a backdoored crypto-themed Python application on macOS that exploited unsafe PyYAML deserialization to run arbitrary code. The malware dropped a Mythic Poseidon agent and a Python stealer that systematically collected authentication materials and configuration details from the host, including Secure Shell (SSH) private keys, AWS access keys, and secret keys from ~/.aws/credentials, environment-based session tokens, and macOS Keychain data.

Using the stolen AWS access key ID, secret key, and the active session token, the DPRK operators authenticated directly into Safe{Wallet}’s AWS account within the token’s twelve-hour validity window. The cached session token, initially created by the victim via AWS mechanisms using GetSessionToken and AWS SSO, stored in standard AWS configuration locations, was replayed from the attacker's infrastructure using the AWS CLI or Boto3, which handles request signing and token use. The attackers operated entirely as the authenticated Safe{Wallet} user, with the MFA context already satisfied at session creation, and issued AWS API calls under that identity, including attempts to register additional MFA devices and to access storage resources.

With valid AWS authentication materials and an active user session, the operators then explored Safe{Wallet}’s cloud environment and accessed the S3 bucket hosting the statically built Safe{Wallet} Next.js frontend. From there, they downloaded, modified, and redeployed the application bundle so that when ByBit approvers loaded the dApp, transaction details displayed in the interface were silently altered while signatures and on-chain workflows still appeared normal.

Third-Party Compromise

Cost of Impact: 5 (Severe)

Abuse of services and compromise of a third-party product can have a severe impact on a victim and an organization, both monetarily and reputationally. Third-party compromise can result in the loss of infrastructure and information for the victim, but the potential reputational impact for the third party can lead to a loss of business and contracts.

Third-party compromise and abuse have a relatively low commonality rating compared to other threats discussed in this report. While the attacks are not the most prevalent among those Insikt Group has observed, they are used when attackers need indirect, trusted access to reach a victim.

Evolution Potential: 5 (Severe)

As cloud adoption accelerates and organizations rely on an ever-growing ecosystem of vendors for hosting, administration, storage, and computation, the potential for third-party compromise will continue to increase and evolve. Each new integration, management service, or colocated data center relationship expands the attack surface and creates additional trust pathways threat actors can exploit. As a result, third-party risk is likely to become both more frequently abused and more technically sophisticated over time, with attackers combining cyber and, where feasible, physical avenues of attack to reach high-value cloud infrastructure through the least-secure entity.

Effort to Perform: 3 (Moderate)

The effort required to compromise third parties varies widely based on the organization and the attacker’s objectives, resulting in a generally moderate overall effort. Well-resourced or highly regulated providers with mature physical and cybersecurity controls can demand significant planning, capability, and time to breach. In contrast, smaller or less mature vendors, legacy partners, or lightly monitored integrations may be compromised with comparatively simple techniques and commodity tooling.

Third-party compromise and abuse in cloud environments describes threat activity that targets the external vendors, platforms, and components organizations rely on, rather than the organization directly. Instead of breaking into the victim’s own accounts from the outset, threat actors compromise a connected identity provider, SaaS platform, MSP, CI/CD service, or other integrated provider and then abuse that trusted connection to reach cloud workloads and data. Because these third-party relationships are deeply embedded into authentication, monitoring, deployment, and business workflows, they often carry broad permissions and implicit trust that can be repurposed for access, persistence, and action on objectives inside victim cloud environments.

In the context of third-party risk (TPR) abuse, threat actors focus on the trust and permissions granted to external services and applications. Compromised vendor portals, support accounts, or management consoles can be used to issue legitimate-looking login sessions, API calls, and configuration changes into the customer’s cloud tenants. OAuth applications, marketplace integrations, and service accounts associated with third parties may be overprivileged or widely deployed across tenants, allowing an attacker who controls the third party to pivot into multiple customers simultaneously. From there, the threat actor can enumerate resources, manipulate identities and policies, or deploy further tooling while appearing as a standard, trusted integration.

Supply-chain compromise in cloud environments extends this model into the software and build pipelines that produce and deliver code to cloud-hosted systems. Threat actors may target source-code repositories, CI/CD platforms, artifact registries, or update mechanisms used by cloud-native applications and services. By tampering with build configurations or injecting malicious logic into dependencies, images, or update channels, they can ensure that compromised components are automatically built, signed, and deployed into production workloads. This gives them a covert and scalable foothold that inherits the permissions and reach of the affected services and applications across cloud accounts and regions.

Package abuse focuses specifically on public or internal package ecosystems that feed into cloud applications and automation. Threat actors publish or modify libraries, containers, or infrastructure-as-code modules in ways that cause them to be pulled into victim environments through normal development and deployment processes. Techniques such as typosquatting, dependency confusion, or hijacking of abandoned packages allow malicious code to enter build pipelines and runtime environments without direct intrusion into the target organization. Once those packages are executed in cloud workloads, they can access credentials, call cloud APIs, exfiltrate data, or stage additional payloads under the guise of standard application behavior, making third-party compromise, supply-chain compromise, and package abuse tightly interlinked risks for cloud-centric organizations.

Threat actors will continue to prioritize third-party compromise and abuse as an efficient means of reaching multiple cloud environments through a single, trusted channel. TPR abuse, supply-chain compromise, and package abuse all allow threat actors to inherit the privileges, reach, and implicit trust granted to vendors, platforms, and components that are deeply woven into cloud identity, deployment, and operations. As organizations increase their reliance on SaaS, MSPs, CI/CD platforms, and external integrations, the potential impact from a single upstream compromise will continue to grow.

Because these attacks ride on top of legitimate integrations, signed artifacts, and expected package use, they will remain difficult to distinguish from regular activity within cloud environments. The combination of broad access, automatic propagation through pipelines, and the ability to masquerade as a trusted third party ensures that TPR abuse, supply-chain compromise, and package abuse will remain high-value strategies for threat actors seeking scalable, low-friction access to cloud workloads and data.

Mitigations and Detections

Figure 11 demonstrates a hypothetical attack chain associated with third-party risk attack methods and behaviors. Throughout this visual, Insikt Group identified parts of the attack chain where defenders can most efficiently hunt for and mitigate behaviors associated with cloud abuse.

① Third-Party SaaS, IdP, and MSP Trust Relationships

Threat actors will target third-party SaaS, identity providers, and managed service providers (such as SSO platforms, remote monitoring tools, or IT service management systems) to gain indirect access to cloud tenants. Compromising these providers enables attackers to establish authenticated sessions, manipulate configurations, or introduce changes into customer environments through trusted channels.

Defenders can mitigate these threats in the following ways:

Establish strict onboarding and risk assessment for third-party providers, including requirements for MFA, logging, incident notification service level agreements (SLAs), and clear scoping of their access into your cloud tenants.

Monitor and regularly review all SSO, federation, and API-based trust relationships (such as SAML, OpenID Connect [OIDC], and vendor-specific integrations), paying close attention to newly added connections, newly granted scopes, or expanded permissions over time.

Correlate vendor-originated activity (such as support logins, remote sessions, or automated remediation actions) in cloud and IdP logs, and alert on activity that occurs outside agreed maintenance windows, locations, or expected patterns.

② Third-Party Integrations Inside the Cloud Tenant

Threat actors will abuse over-privileged third-party integrations, such as OAuth applications, marketplace add-ons, service principals, and API keys, to perform operations directly within cloud environments. Once these integrations are compromised upstream, attackers can pivot into multiple tenants and conduct discovery, data access, or configuration changes under the guise of legitimate apps.

Defenders can mitigate these threats in the following ways:

Implement a formal approval process for third-party cloud applications and service principals, requiring justification, scope review, and security validation before granting tenant-wide or high-privilege permissions.

Continuously monitor for new app consents, increased permission scopes, or unusual usage of existing service principals, and alert when an integration begins accessing resources or performing actions outside its documented purpose.

Enforce least privilege for all third-party integrations, limiting them to specific roles, resource groups, and APIs, and regularly re-certify access to ensure unused or unnecessary permissions are removed.

③ CI/CD Pipelines, Artifact Registries, and Package Abuse

Threat actors will exploit software supply chains by tampering with CI/CD pipelines, internal artifact registries, or package feeds, as well as public package ecosystems. By injecting malicious dependencies, images, or build steps, they can ensure compromised components are automatically built, signed, and deployed into cloud workloads as part of routine development and release processes.

Defenders can mitigate these threats in the following ways:

Harden CI/CD platforms by enforcing MFA for pipeline administrators, restricting who can edit build configurations, and maintaining audit logs for all pipeline and credential changes.

Require provenance and signing for artifacts (such as container images, binaries, and infrastructure-as-code templates), and enforce that production environments only run artifacts that pass signature and integrity verification.

Limit the use of public package repositories to vetted sources, implement dependency and software composition analysis, and alert on the introduction of new, unreviewed dependencies, particularly when they resemble existing internal or popular packages (for example, typosquatting or dependency confusion patterns).

④ Workloads and Data Plane Executing Third-Party Components

Threat actors will leverage compromised third-party code running in cloud workloads, applications, containers, serverless functions, and background jobs to execute their objectives. Once deployed, these components can silently exfiltrate data, abuse workload identities to call cloud APIs, stage ransomware, or create covert channels that blend with normal application behavior.

Defenders can mitigate these threats in the following ways:

Deploy runtime security as well as EDR and Cloud Workload Protection Platform (CWPP) capabilities on workloads to detect anomalous behavior originating from application processes, such as unexpected outbound connections, abnormal API calls, or access to sensitive secrets and data stores.

Apply the principle of least privilege to workload identities and secrets, ensuring that even if a third-party component is compromised, it can only interact with a minimal set of resources and cannot directly manage keys, backups, or broader tenant configurations.

Enforce network segmentation and egress controls for workloads, restricting outbound connectivity to approved destinations (such as known APIs, registries, and partner endpoints), and alert on connections to unknown IPs or domains from production workloads.

⑤ Security and Observability Plane: Vendor Telemetry and Monitoring

Threat actors will attempt to exploit or degrade the security and observability plane, including integrations with third-party security tools and monitoring services. By tampering with log forwarding, disabling agents, or abusing shared trust with security vendors, attackers may reduce visibility into their activity or generate misleading signals.

Defenders can mitigate these threats in the following ways:

Centralize log collection from cloud services, IdPs, vendors, and on-prem infrastructure into hardened, controlled logging environments, and verify that vendor-provided logs are complete, timely, and correlated with internal telemetry.

Monitor changes to logging configurations, security tool integrations, and agent deployments, and generate high-severity alerts when critical data sources are disabled, downgraded, or suddenly become unavailable without an approved change.

Validate that detections and incident notifications from managed security providers are being delivered and actioned as expected, and periodically simulate vendor-originated incidents or test cases to confirm that integrations and response workflows function correctly.

⑥ Physical Data Centers, Colocation, and On-Premise Pivots

Threat actors may exploit physical security weaknesses at data centers, colocation facilities, or on-premises environments connected to the cloud via direct connect, VPN, or multiprotocol label switching (MPLS). By abusing contracted technicians, stolen badges, unsecured network closets, or poorly controlled smart-hands access, they can tamper with on-premise switches, cross-connects, or management consoles, creating a pivot into cloud environments or disrupting connectivity.

Defenders can mitigate these threats in the following ways:

Enforce strong physical access controls at on-premise and colocation sites, including badge plus biometric access, visitor registration, escort policies for third-party technicians, and strict separation of customer cages or racks.

Harden network and compute infrastructure in data centers by locking racks, securing console ports, enabling port security and network access control on switches, and monitoring for unauthorized devices or link changes on uplinks and cross-connects.

Require cloud and data center providers to meet defined physical security standards and audit requirements, and ensure that connectivity paths between on-premise and cloud (such as direct connect circuits, VPN gateways, and SD-WAN appliances) are monitored for configuration changes, link disruptions, or unexpected routing behavior that could signal tampering.

Insikt Group curated a list of events published during 2025 that demonstrate the threats posed by third-party compromise. These events are discussed below.

On October 28, 2025, SecurityWeek (Eduard Kovacs) described an extortion campaign in which Cl0p ransomware threat actors, linked by the security community to an unknown cluster of the FIN11 profit-driven threat group, exploited Oracle E-Business Suite (EBS) zero-day vulnerabilities to steal data from Oracle customers, including Schneider Electric, Emerson, Logitech, GlobalLogic, and Dartmouth College. These sources collectively depict a third-party risk scenario in which compromise of a shared Oracle EBS platform at the vendor layer cascades into multi-sector data breaches, with victim organizations emphasizing that the incidents affected Oracle-hosted or other third-party systems rather than their core IT or production environments.

The attack chain began with the exploitation of at least one Oracle EBS zero-day vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-61882, against Oracle EBS instances starting in early August 2025, enabling unauthorized access to EBS platforms used by multiple organizations. For GlobalLogic, BleepingComputer reports that threat actor activity in the Oracle environment occurred between July 10 and August 20, 2025, with confirmed access to Oracle and data exfiltration on October 9, 2025, followed by notification to more than 10,000 current and former employees whose information was stored in the EBS deployment. GlobalLogic’s disclosure states that the incident did not target or impact systems outside its Oracle platform and that the affected data was confined to HR information stored in Oracle. SecurityWeek notes that over 50 victims have been identified on Cl0p’s leak website to date, and that the group is releasing stolen information in large archive sets and torrents, indicating systematic exfiltration from Oracle environments across multiple organizations.

GlobalLogic reports that attackers exploited an Oracle EBS zero-day vulnerability to steal personal information belonging to 10,471 employees, including HR-collected data such as names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, dates of birth, passport information, national or tax identifiers (including Social Security numbers), and bank account details. Dartmouth College has disclosed that an unauthorized threat actor accessed files from its Oracle EBS servers between August 9 and August 12, 2025. Subsequent review identified files containing names and Social Security numbers, as well as documents with financial account information, for at least 1,494 individuals notified to date. In both cases, the adversary’s behavior involves exploiting the shared Oracle EBS platform, collecting sensitive identity and financial data stored there, and then using the Cl0p leak site as leverage in an extortion model focused on data theft rather than disrupting the victims’ primary business systems.

Logitech reports that an unauthorized third party exploited a zero-day vulnerability in a third-party software platform to extract limited data about employees, consumers, customers, and suppliers from an internal IT system. The company states that no national ID numbers, credit card data, products, business operations, or manufacturing systems were affected. SecurityWeek links this activity to the same Oracle EBS campaign claimed by Cl0p, which has listed Logitech on its leak site and published 1.8 TB of alleged Logitech archives, alongside large Oracle-sourced data sets for Emerson (2.7 TB), Schneider Electric (116 GB), Harvard University, and Envoy Air, underscoring systemic third-party exposure across multiple sectors.

On November 10, 2025, Veracode Threat Research published an analysis of a malicious npm package, “@acitons/artifact”, that typosquats the legitimate GitHub Actions dependency “@actions/artifact” and targets GitHub-owned repositories using the GitHub Actions CI/CD platform. The report states that six malicious versions of this package included a post-install hook that downloaded and executed additional malware not detected by popular antivirus products at the time of analysis. Furthermore, the malicious versions were removed, while the package name itself remained on npm. Veracode assessed that the campaign intended to execute during builds of GitHub-owned repositories, exfiltrate build-environment tokens, and then use those tokens to publish new malicious artifacts on GitHub, highlighting software supply-chain risk consistent with OWASP Top 10 2025 “A03:2025 – Software Supply Chain Failures.”

The attack chain begins with supply-chain compromise via a deceptive package.json that closely mirrors the legitimate “@actions/artifact” metadata, including the same homepage, repository URL, and description, but swaps the letters “ti” for “it” in the package name to form “@acitons/artifact”. The malicious versions (4.0.12 through 4.0.17) define a postinstall script that runs curl against a GitHub Gist URL under the user “jmasdg” to fetch a binary named harness, which is then executed on the GitHub Actions runner as part of npm installation. The blog notes that VirusTotal did not initially show popular antivirus vendors detecting the harness binary as malicious.

Analysis of the harness binary reveals that it is an obfuscated shell script compiled with the Shell Script Compiler, which includes a hard-coded expiration mechanism to prevent execution after 2025-11-06 UTC. A related sample (tester) expires one day later. On execution, harness re-runs itself under bash after setting an environment variable to alter its runtime behavior, then outputs, extracts, and executes an embedded Node.js package containing an obfuscated verify.js script. verify.js performs environment checks for GitHub Actions by examining GITHUB_ environment variables and proceeds only when the repository owner is GitHub, exiting otherwise. The script writes an encrypted data blob (env.enc) after collecting environment data, including tokens available to the build job.

The payload obtains an AES encryption key from hxxps://83hfhjasksn.hopto[.]org:443/kljkalsd/ajkl12389/slkj1n_189n, described as a service used for resolving DNS names, encrypts the collected data, and exfiltrates the encrypted file to hxxps://laughing-space-capybara-x5g6rjxq7jwvfp6q6-443.app.github[.]dev/sllkjdsss_user-dasd.txt. The campaign appears to focus on GitHub’s own repositories and a low-activity user account, “y8793hfiuashfjksdhfjsk”, which may be used for testing purposes. Historical inspection also identified and blocked twelve versions of another malicious npm package, 8jfiesaf83, earlier in the month. GitHub later provided a statement that the referenced packages were part of a tightly controlled red team exercise, asserting that GitHub systems and data were not at risk.

On February 12, 2025, Datadog Security Labs published research describing the “whoAMI” cloud image name confusion attack, a misconfiguration pattern in how many software projects retrieve Amazon Machine Image (AMI) IDs that allows attackers who publish specially crafted AMIs to gain code execution within vulnerable Amazon Web Services (AWS) accounts. The research identifies that this vulnerable pattern, retrieving AMIs by name via ec2:DescribeImages without constraining the owner and then using the most recent returned image, appears across private and open-source repositories; Datadog estimates that roughly 1% of organizations using AWS are affected and that, at scale, the technique enables access to thousands of AWS accounts. The team also confirmed that internal non-production AWS systems were susceptible to the same pattern before AWS fixed the issue through its Vulnerability Disclosure Program (VDP).

From the victim’s perspective, the attack chain begins when code retrieves an AMI ID using the ec2:DescribeImages API with a name filter, omits the owner, owner-alias, or owner-id parameters, and then selects the most recent image from the results. The same AMI ID is subsequently used to create EC2 instances, launch templates, and deploy other infrastructure. Datadog illustrates this with a common Terraform data aws_ami pattern that sets most_recent = true and filters on ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-focal-20.04-amd64-server-* but does not specify an owner. This causes the AWS API call to return public community AMIs from any account, and Terraform automatically chooses the newest AMI in that list. Similar anti-patterns appear in Go and other languages where code logic calls DescribeImages with only a name filter (for example, values matching amzn2-ami-hvm-2.0.*-x86_64-gp2) and then passes the first returned ImageId directly into RunInstances.

An attacker exploiting this configuration publishes or clones an AMI whose name matches the victim’s search pattern and ensures it is newer than any legitimate images. Then, the attacker either makes the AMI public or privately shares it with the targeted AWS account. Datadog’s example uses a malicious AMI named ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-focal-20.04-amd64-server-whoAMI, which will be selected whenever vulnerable Terraform or API code resolves “latest Ubuntu Focal” via name-only search. When such code runs, the EC2 instance is launched from the attacker’s AMI rather than the intended provider’s image, allowing the attacker to execute remote code on the victim’s instance and enabling any subsequent post-exploitation activity supported by the backdoor embedded in the AMI. To demonstrate this safely, Datadog created an AMI with a C2 backdoor, shared it privately with a controlled “victim” account, and showed that the vulnerable pattern reliably instantiated the attacker’s AMI.

The vulnerable AMI-lookup pattern is not limited to Terraform. It appears in multiple ecosystems, including Python, Go, Java, Pulumi, and Bash scripts that use the AWS CLI, whenever DescribeImages is filtered only by name and the “most recent” image is selected. Datadog reports that roughly 1% of monitored organizations exhibited this anti-pattern, affecting thousands of distinct AWS accounts. After validating the attack in a controlled environment, Datadog collaborated with AWS to test whether internal AWS systems would consume benign “doppelgänger” AMIs with the prefix amzn2-ami-hvm-2.0; tens of thousands of SharedSnapshotVolumeCreated events showed that AWS services were indeed pulling these AMIs, indicating that some internal, non-production environments were using insecure AMI retrieval logic before the issue was remediated. The research also highlights a vulnerable AWS-maintained tool, aws-simple-ec2-cli, whose hard-coded wildcard AMI name patterns (such as amzn2-ami-hvm-2.?.????????.?-*-gp2) and lack of owner checks in getDescribeImagesInputs allowed a cloned AMI amzn2-ami-hvm-2.0.20241014.0-RESEARCH-x86_64-gp2 (AMI ID ami-08b96120f4ae90485) to be selected over the official image until the tool was updated.

General Mitigations and Recommendations

While specific mitigation strategies have been discussed for each of the cloud threats outlined in this report, Insikt Group identified general mitigation strategies that can be implemented based on the events discussed in this report. The following threat hunting and mitigation strategies can be implemented in any cloud environment to increase the environment’s security posture:

Vulnerability and Third-Party Exposure Management

Enforce aggressive patching and configuration management for internet-exposed cloud and hybrid services, treating vendor advisories for critical CVEs as triggers for patching products that front cloud workloads or identity infrastructure.

Enforce strict vendor and third-party risk controls for shared cloud platforms (for example, Oracle EBS, Barracuda ESG appliances, cloud email gateways), including contractual security requirements, patch service level agreements (SLA), segmentation of hosted data, and a clear understanding of whose logging and detection covers the shared environment.

Minimize sensitive data stored in third-party cloud platforms to the minimum required for business operations, and segment HR, financial, and identity data so that compromise of a single hosted system does not automatically expose full identity and banking datasets across the organization.

Network and Perimeter Controls

Minimize direct internet exposure of management and monitoring planes by placing them behind cloud VPNs, private access tools, or zero-trust products and restricting access to internal cloud infrastructure.

Enforce strong egress controls on cloud workloads and user devices, explicitly scrutinizing or restricting traffic to general-purpose SaaS platforms that can act as covert C2 or dead-drop channels.

Deploy granular network controls around cloud storage and backup services (S3, Azure Storage, Recovery Services Vaults, snapshots, EBS volumes) to prevent broad access, and require elevated workflows for operations such as exposing storage to the internet, retrieving access keys, or deleting backups and restore points.

Ensure DDoS protection is enabled and correctly scoped for all internet-facing cloud endpoints, and regularly exercise operational readiness through simulated large-scale volumetric attacks to confirm that workloads remain available when targeted by IoT botnets and similar infrastructure.

Implement the principle of least privilege in cloud IAM for both human and non-human cloud accounts, explicitly removing broad roles and powerful permissions, such as global administrator and owner roles, from day-to-day and developer accounts.

Require strong, enforceable MFA on all privileged and directory-synchronized accounts and prohibit any high-privileged account from operating without MFA, including service accounts where password-hash synchronization is used.

Harden MFA and help desk workflows so that high-value identities (such as C-suite accounts, cloud administrators, and other root accounts) cannot have MFA or passwords reset based solely on static personal data, and ensure help desk tooling clearly flags privileged accounts and enforces additional verification steps before changing authentication factors.

Restrict cross-tenant and cross-account trust relationships in cloud identity platforms, allowing sts:AssumeRole, SAML federation, and multi-tenant OAuth apps only where explicitly required and reviewing them regularly for abuse patterns similar to those used in Storm-0501 and Silk Typhoon campaigns.

Implement strong governance for service principals and OAuth applications in cloud identity (for example, Entra ID), including reviewing app consents, monitoring for new high-privilege apps or credentials added to existing apps, and validating that multi-tenant applications are necessary for system operation.

Constrain session-token lifetime and monitor for unusual use of cached tokens from atypical locations, especially where an attacker could replay a developer’s existing authenticated session to access AWS or other cloud control planes without re-prompting MFA.

Implement robust processes for account deletion and access revocation to prevent accounts associated with former staff or contractors from being reused as entry points to cloud tenants or repositories. Periodically verify that no shared or orphaned admin credentials remain in an environment.

Monitor privileged access vaults and key stores (for example, CyberArk, cloud key vaults, PAM platforms), and alert on actions such as bulk secret access, high-volume credential export, and new access grants that could support lateral movement into cloud services at scale.

Software Supply Chain and CI/CD hardening

Treat all API keys, cloud access keys, and session tokens as high-value secrets. Scan public and internal repositories for exposed secret or sensitive keys, rotate any discovered keys, and ensure developer tools do not leave long-lived credentials in predictable file system locations or plaintext configuration files.

Restrict cloud image selection workflows by always constraining AMI lookups to trusted owners and accounts, and use platform controls such as AWS “Allowed AMIs” plus periodic scanning (for example, with tooling similar to whoAMI-scanner) to detect and prohibit workloads booted from unverified or public AMIs.

Review Infrastructure-as-Code, scripts, and software development kit (SDK) usage for unsafe AMI lookup patterns and enforce coding standards that require explicit owner filters for cloud images across Terraform, CLI tooling, and automation code.

Isolate and harden cloud ML and LLM services by separating developer and production accounts, restricting internet egress from notebooks, limiting execution roles to only required actions, and preventing developer notebooks from assuming administrative or cross-account roles in production LLM environments.

Treat LLM guardrails, agents, and retrieval-augmented generation knowledge bases as sensitive configuration surfaces. Protect these resources with change controls, monitor for modifications to guardrail block messages or knowledge base data sources, and require review for any changes that could inject malicious download links or executable code into user-visible responses.

Protect cloud-hosted static frontends and application bundles (for example, S3-backed web apps) with strict change control, code-signing, or integrity checks. Monitor for unexpected changes to objects or buckets that present user interfaces.

Strengthen security around continuous integration and continuous delivery or development (CI/CD) environments (for example, GitHub Actions) by scrutinizing dependency declarations for typosquatted packages, pinning versions where feasible, and implementing automated checks to block or flag suspicious packages that add postinstall hooks or fetch binaries from untrusted domains.

Restrict CI/CD job tokens and other ephemeral credentials to the narrowest required scopes and lifetimes, and monitor pipeline hosts for outbound connections to unusual domains or encrypted data uploads that could indicate token exfiltration from build environments.

Protect corporate and cloud-provider code repositories (for example, GitHub) with strong MFA, access reviews for former employees and contractors, and backup/archival strategies that allow rapid restoration if a destructive actor wipes repositories or branches.

Monitoring, Detection, and Response

Monitor for identity operations indicative of cloud ransomware playbooks, such as elevation of access (for example, Azure elevateAccess), mass assignment of owner or equivalent roles across subscriptions, creation of new federated trusts, and large-scale storage enumeration and key retrieval.

Ensure logging is comprehensive and retained for identity, control-plane, and data-plane actions across cloud providers. Integrate those logs with analytic workflows capable of detecting credential abuse, cross-tenant pivots, and mass exfiltration.

Endpoint and Administrative Workstation Hardening

Harden developer and administrative endpoints that bridge into cloud control planes by prohibiting cracked or pirated software, enforcing endpoint protection and application control, and treating any system with cloud access keys or SSO tokens as a high-value asset requiring stronger monitoring and restriction.

Backup and Recovery Hardening

Use cloud-native protections, such as immutability (for example, read-only permissions), locks, and retention policies, on backup containers, snapshots, and vaults. This ensures that even highly privileged roles cannot easily delete or alter recovery data in a single step during ransomware or destructive cloud attacks.

The most common CSPs offer native cloud services that enable the mitigation strategies discussed above, including environment scanning for potential misconfigurations, baseline account behavior monitoring, network traffic monitoring, role-based access control or IAM suites, and data protection. However, in cloud environments where there are fewer managed cloud services and more responsibility for defense is more greatly assumed by the cloud defenders and architects, ensuring that clear policies and baselines are specified for the creation, management, and upkeep of an organization’s cloud infrastructure is paramount.

The events discussed in this report from 2025 indicate that threat actors have a growing understanding of both cloud environments and the benefits that they provide as part of an attack chain. Events related to cloud ransomware, threat actor abuse of cloud LLM and ML services, and the abuse of various cloud services for C2 infrastructure all support this claim and further demonstrate that legitimate cloud resources can be abused to achieve malicious aims. Threat actors will almost certainly continue to identify additional cloud platforms and products that can be abused to perform malicious actions. Similarly, threat actors will continue to leverage cloud-native services as methods in attack chains against cloud environments, specifically since these methods are the most effective option for threat actors to disrupt and steal from cloud environments.

To perform these actions, threat actors must continue to gain unauthorized access, both at the perimeter of cloud environments and within them. The most common ways this access will be granted, both externally and internally, will remain misconfiguration and valid credential abuse, in that order. However, threat actors are demonstrating that exploiting products embedded at the perimeter of cloud environments, or in instances of private cloud, is a viable option for cloud compromise. As the adoption rates of cloud computing continue to increase, the volume of new products and services will also rise, leading to an increase in potential vulnerabilities and misconfigurations. Threat actors will continue to exploit these weaknesses as a result. Furthermore, as more programs and services written with AI-driven code emerge in cloud ecosystems, the number of vulnerabilities from unchecked code will also increase, providing avenues for threat actors to exploit cloud users and services.

Finally, data theft remains the most significant outcome of attacks on cloud environments; however, threat actors are increasingly pursuing additional outcomes, including coercion techniques in the cloud and various forms of resource hijacking. As such, the overall dwell time associated with attacks against cloud environments may increase, as threat actors may require additional time and resources for an attack chain to reach fruition, or to maximize the benefit of their attacks. While this dwell time may provide defenders more time to identify and remediate malicious actions within their environments, it also provides attackers with more opportunity to identify sensitive information. The longer these entities can maintain access, the greater the risk of compromise for the entire cloud environment.

[19] Cyberscoop - Ukrainian sentenced to 5 years in prison for facilitating North Korean remote worker scheme

[TAM METİN - 618 kelime]
A Ukrainian national who ran multiple operations to aid the North Korean government’s expansive scheme to  hire remote IT workers at U.S. companies was sentenced to five years in prison, the Justice Department said Thursday.

Oleksandr Didenko stole U.S. citizens’ identities and created more than 2,500 fraudulent accounts on freelance IT job forums, money service transmitters, email services, and social media platforms to sell the proxy identities to North Korean workers. The 29-year-old pleaded guilty to multiple crimes related to the six-year scheme in November 2025.

Didenko ran a site, upworksell.com, to sell the stolen identities and paid co-conspirators to receive and host laptop farms in Virginia, Tennessee and California, according to court records. He managed up to 871 identities through the laptop farms and helped North Korean technical workers gain employment at 40 U.S. companies.

Didenko funneled money from Americans and U.S. businesses into the coffers of North Korea’s hostile regime, Jeanine Pirro, U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, said in a statement.

“Today, North Korea is not only a threat to the homeland from afar, it is an enemy within. By using stolen and fraudulent identities, North Korean actors are infiltrating American companies, stealing information, licensing, and data that is harmful to any business,” she added.

Officials said Didenko’s North Korean clients were paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for their work, much of which was falsely reported in the names of U.S. citizens whose identities were stolen.

“Money paid to these so-called employees goes directly to munitions programs in North Korea,” Pirro said. “This is not just a financial crime; it is a crime against national security.”

In late 2023, following a request from one of his customers, Didenko sent a computer to a laptop farm run by Christina Chapman in Arizona, officials said. Chapman was arrested in May 2024 and sentenced to 102 months in prison for participating in the scheme.

Didenko’s site was seized following Chapman’s arrest. He was arrested by Polish police in late 2024, and later extradited to the United States.

Didenko pleaded guilty to wire fraud conspiracy and aggravated identity theft, and agreed to forfeit more than $1.4 million as part of his sentencing. He was also ordered to pay almost $47,000 in restitution.

U.S. law enforcement has racked up some wins by seizing stolen cryptocurrency and targeting U.S.-based facilitators who provide forged or stolen identities for North Korean operatives.

Yet, the regime’s scheme runs deep. North Korean nationals have infiltrated many top global companies, and researchers continue to uncover evidence of new tactics and techniques operatives have used to evade detection.

[20] Cyberscoop - State Dept. official says post-quantum transition plans will outlive current leadership
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Thu, 19 Feb 2026 20:43:08 +0000

[TAM METİN - 660 kelime]
A cybersecurity official at the State Department called for the public and private sector to more tightly coordinate plans to transition their systems, devices and data to quantum-resistant encryption algorithms.

Gharun Lacy, Deputy Assistant Secretary for the Cyber and Technology Security Directorate at the Department of State, issued a challenge for cybersecurity defenders to view their own individual “post-quantum” encryption plans as a small part in a greater collective project to make the entire digital ecosystem more resilient against longer-term threats like quantum-enabled cyberattacks.

With adversaries like China able to target “entire ecosystems” for digital compromise, Lacy argued for the industries and sectors being plundered to come together in shared interest and create strong and consistent protections across society. In that context, modernization is about more than upgrading your technology or encryption.

“We have to defend holistically as an ecosystem,” said Lacy while speaking at CyberTalks, presented by CyberScoop, in Washington D.C. Thursday. “The organization that goes by themselves in modernization will not succeed.”

The State Department is exploring the potential for predictive attack chain analysis, using historical telemetry and planning to predict “where we’re going to be in the future.” Other countries are doing the same, he said, underscoring how challenges like data harvesting must be addressed for national security purposes.

Modernization plans must do more than update technology to perform the same security functions more effectively. They should also reshape the threat surface while “breaking some of the tendencies that are predictable from our historical data.”

“It’s not just about modernizing hardware, it’s not just about implementing AI faster,” said Lacy. “It’s about injecting that little segment of randomness that means the adversary that’s reading, 10, 20 years of our history cannot use that to deduce” our plans.

U.S. federal agencies and the private sector are working broadly towards the goal of having most or all high-risk systems, data and devices transitioned to newer post-quantum algorithms by 2035. This reflects the long-term nature of the threat, as no one can say for certain when a quantum computer capable of breaking some classical forms of encryption will arrive.

But the Trump administration and private sector cybersecurity officials have been mulling whether the risks around data harvesting and recent advances in quantum computing may merit faster timelines.

Lacy said the risk organizations face around data harvesting – or foreign nations collecting encrypted data today to break later with a quantum computer — will be “like an accordion,” presenting a threat that stretches across time. Individual organizations will need to do more than work with each other to execute their post quantum cryptographic plans. They will have to do it across generations, meaning “we cannot shift priority just because our leadership changes.”

“When you look at long horizon priorities of a nation state actor like China, that means that your data and the risk it poses to you will now outlive leadership cycles,” said Lacy.

[21] Cyberscoop -  FBI: Threats from Salt Typhoon are ‘still very much ongoing’
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Thu, 19 Feb 2026 18:44:16 +0000

[TAM METİN - 591 kelime]
A top FBI cyber official said Salt Typhoon, the Chinese cyber espionage group behind the widespread compromise of U.S. telecommunications infrastructure in 2024, continues to pose a broad threat to both America’s private and public sectors.

Michael Machtinger, deputy assistant director for cyber intelligence at the FBI, touted improved partnerships between the telecommunications industry and government in the wake of the campaign while speaking at CyberTalks, presented by CyberScoop, in Washington D.C. Thursday.

Companies who engaged with the FBI and federal agencies like CISA early after the campaign went public “have been without a doubt the most successful in mitigating the impact of the Salt Typhoon intrusions,” he claimed.

Last year, CyberScoop’s reporting found that the U.S. telecommunications sector was riddled with basic cybersecurity vulnerabilities and patchwork consolidated networks, and Salt Typhoon took advantage of these weaknesses to gain widespread, persistent access to major telecom networks.

Machtinger echoed a similar sentiment in describing lessons the FBI took away from the episode, saying that “despite all the advances in cybersecurity tools and strategies, it is still the most basic vulnerabilities that provide entry points.”

Cybersecurity leaders and network defenders have a responsibility to understand their own vulnerabilities and implement “fundamental” cybersecurity practices such as zero trust, least-privilege access, secure-by-design principles, end-to-end encryption and other protections.

Despite an increasingly complex threat and technology environment, phishing attacks or targeting vulnerable legacy systems are still the most common ways the FBI sees hacking groups gain access to their victims. While foreign intelligence agencies do use zero-day vulnerabilities and other sophisticated tools to compromise well-defended systems, “by and large this is not what we are seeing, and it is not what we saw in Salt Typhoon.”

“None of these concepts are new…and truthfully they’re not all that advanced, but they are increasingly essential as adversaries adapt their tactics and our attack surface becomes more widespread,” said Machtinger. “If we’re going to safeguard our personal and proprietary information, it is just as important for us to lock the doors inside the house as it is to lock the front door.”

But these lessons haven’t diminished the threat. Machtinger estimated that Salt Typhoon’s intrusions have impacted more than 80 countries, often following the same playbook of pairing broad access with “indiscriminate” targeting and collection.

It is “important to recognize that the threat posed by Salt Typhoon actors and the rest of the PRC intelligence apparatus and enabling infrastructure is still very, very much ongoing,” Machtinger said.

[22] Cyberscoop - HHS burrows into identifying risks to health sector from third-party vendors
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[TAM METİN - 465 kelime]
A Department of Health and Human Services official said Thursday that HHS is devoting a lot of attention to the security of third-party service providers after the 2024 Change Healthcare cyberattack.

That attack, which is widely regarded as the biggest ever in the sector — including by HHS’s Charlee Hess, who spoke Thursday at CyberTalks presented by CyberScoop — began with hackers exploiting the lack of multifactor authentication set up on a remote access portal at Change Healthcare.

“It wasn’t a hospital, it was a company most people have never heard of and had major impacts on our sector and threatened the liquidity of our entire health care system,” said Hess, director of the healthcare and public health sector cybersecurity at the Administration for Strategy Preparedness and Response division. “We recovered from that, but we realized there are third-party risks lurking in our health care system, and we don’t even know they’re there. Where are those entities or systems that will have an outsized impact on our sector?”

That realization arose from meetings between HHS and industry, she said. The focus on third-party service provider risk came next.

“We are going through and working through a methodology to identify that, and we’ve been working with industry on doing that, really finding where those places are,” Hess said.

The Change Healthcare breach, which exposed the data of 190 million people, has triggered other government responses, too, including on Capitol Hill.

It also prompted UnitedHealth Group, the parent company of Change Healthcare to “start over” on its use of computer systems. But industry has also bristled at the notion of mandatory cybersecurity requirements on hospitals — in part because, they note, the Change Healthcare attack wasn’t their fault.

[23] Cyberscoop - ONCD official says Trump administration aims to bolster AI use for defense without increasing risk

[TAM METİN - 584 kelime]
The Trump administration wants to boost the use of artificial intelligence for security in a way that doesn’t increase the number of targets for adversaries to attack, a top official with the Office of the National Cyber Director said Thursday.

The administration will “promote the rapid implementation of AI enabled cyber defensive tools to detect, divert and deceive threat actors who continue targeting our vital systems and sectors,” Alexandra Seymour, principal deputy assistant cyber director for policy, said at CyberTalks, presented by CyberScoop. “We want to ensure that as Americans, companies and agencies deploy AI to defend themselves, they are not inadvertently making themselves more vulnerable by widening the attack surface.”

Overall, “We’re working with our interagency and White House colleagues to promote AI-driven success while addressing concerns about AI security and countering AI abuse by adversaries,” she said.

The focus on AI is expected to get further attention from a forthcoming national cyber strategy and the implementation of that strategy due to follow.

“We are prioritizing rapid but secure AI development and diffusion,” Seymour said. “From the start, we will support a full range of counter-AI efforts, assuring our frontier models and countering adversary AI that controls or threatens citizens.”

Seymour reiterated how that means promoting U.S. AI cybersecurity standards and norms, but also  “establishing industry best practices for secure AI deployment and harnessing the full potential of AI tools.”

One of the six pillars of that forthcoming strategy is focused on strengthening the cybersecurity workforce. The administration wants to consolidate existing efforts, drawing on the work of companies, government, academia, vocational schools and venture capital, Seymour said.

The administration wants to align “curriculum, workforce standards, cyber literacy, awards and job placement,” she said.

Seymour said one thing the administration hopes to emulate is Israel’s Unit 8200, an intelligence arm of the Israeli government that counts cyberwarfare among its missions. Its practices for training young talent includes boot camp-like classes and exercises.

“The White House does not want to reinvent the wheel, because we recognize the magnitude of great work in the space across the public and private sectors to train and upskill the cyber workforce,” Seymour said. “Rather, we hope to bring these existing resources all together to build a workforce pipeline that is clear, accessible and responsive to cyber skill gaps, including those related to emerging technologies such as AI and quantum.”

[24] The Register - Crims create fake remote management vendor that actually sells a RAT

Crims create fake remote management vendor that actually sells a RAT

$300 a month buys you a backdoor that looks like legit software

Researchers at Proofpoint late last month uncovered what they describe as a "weird twist" on the growing trend of criminals abusing remote monitoring and management software (RMM) as their preferred attack tools.

These folks created an entirely fake RMM vendor that purports to sell enterprise software for $300 a month. In fact, it's a remote access trojan (RAT) being sold as a service. Call it a RATaaS.

The criminals behind the malware took great care to make their product appear legitimate, giving it the name TrustConnect. They even built a fake business website and obtained a legitimate Extended Validation code-signing certificate to digitally sign malware and allow it to bypass security controls.

At first, the crooks even fooled Proofpoint’s threat hunters themselves. "Initially, TrustConnect appeared to be another legitimate RMM tool being abused," the company’s research team said in a Thursday post.

Criminals prefer using legitimate, commercial software for nefarious purposes because it makes it easier for them to hide inside enterprise IT environments.

Over the past year or so, RMM tools have moved to the top of attackers' must-have list. There are many of them to choose from, enterprises already use and trust many of these tools, and they provide a direct, remote pipeline to victims' machines for deploying ransomware, info-stealers, and other malware, and maintaining long-term access to infected systems.

Security shop Huntress, in its annual cyber threat report released this week, noted skyrocketing RMM abuse, jumping 277 percent in 2025 compared to the year prior and accounting for 24 percent of all observed incidents.

Abuse of Trust(Connect)

The domain, trustconnectsoftware[.]com, was created on January 12 and the website there was probably written by an AI, according to Proofpoint.

"The malware creator uses the domain as the 'business website' designed to convince the public (including certificate providers) that the software is a legitimate RMM app, providing fake details like customer statistics and software documentation," the team wrote.

This website is also where criminals purchase (via cryptocurrency) a monthly subscription to use the service, and it acts as a command-and-control (C2) center for the malware.

The domain also likely made it easier for the malware operators to purchase a legitimate EV certificate to sign the malware. While the certificate has since been revoked as of February 6, any files signed before then remain valid. Proofpoint credits researchers at The Cert Graveyard for assisting in the revocation of the certificate.

The malware's C2, hosted on 178[.]128[.]69[.]245, was also disrupted by Proofpoint and anonymous industry partners as of February 17. However, that doesn't appear to be costing the operators any business as they quickly spun up new infrastructure and began testing a rebranded version of the RAT.

"Shortly before publication of this report, Proofpoint analysts identified a pivot to parallel infrastructure and testing of a new agent payload, called 'DocConnect' or 'SHIELD OS v1.0,'" the researchers wrote.

The RAT backdoors users' machines and gives attackers full mouse and keyboard control, allowing them to record and stream the victim's screen. It also provides other typical remote desktop management capabilities such as file transfer, command execution, and user account control bypass.

Redline infostealer ties

Proofpoint has attributed the TrustConnect malware "with moderate confidence" to a Redline infostealer customer due to a Telegram handle: @zacchyy09. This was the contact info listed for support and sales inquiries on the TrustConnect website, and the handle was also mentioned as a VIP customer in Operation Magnus, the joint law enforcement effort to takedown the Redline and META information stealing malware in October 2024.

In the blog, the threat hunters detail several campaigns used to distribute the fake RMM, including a phishing operation that began January 26. The emails, sent in both English and French, purported to be invitations to submit a proposal and bid for an upcoming project – with a malicious link to the "full project package."

The URL leads to an executable file, MsTeams.exe, that drops another executable called TrustConnectAgent.exe and communicates with the TrustConnect RAT C2 server.

“Message volumes ranged from a few dozen to fewer than a thousand per campaign,” Proofpoint threat researcher Selena Larson, told The Register. “Campaigns also varied in terms of the number of customers receiving the messages which ranged from less than ten to over one hundred.”

Ransomware scum disrupted utility services with SimpleHelp attacks

DragonForce double-whammy: First hit an MSP, then use RMM software to push ransomware

Ransomware crews don't care about your endpoint security – they've already killed it

Who's the bossware? Ransomware slingers like employee monitoring tools, too

Other lures used by criminals distributing TrustConnect mention taxes, shared documents, meeting invitations, events, and government themes, we're told.

Plus, multiple campaigns delivered different – legitimate – RMMs alongside TrustConnect, including ScreenConnect and LogMeIn Resolve.

"The use of legitimate remote enterprise tooling both alongside and as a follow-on malware suggest this RAT is very much embedded with the overall ecosystem of threat actors abusing these tools, and the MaaS provider is likely selling to the same customers abusing real RMM payloads and infrastructure in campaigns," Proofpoint noted. ®

[25] The Register - Crims hit a $20M jackpot via malware-stuffed ATMs

Crims hit a $20M jackpot via malware-stuffed ATMs

FBI warns these cyber-physical attacks are on the rise

Thieves stole more than $20 million from compromised ATMs last year using a malware-assisted technique that the FBI says is on the uptick across the United States.

They are doing this through ATM jackpotting - a cyber-physical attack in which crooks exploit physical and software vulnerabilities in ATMs to deploy malware that instructs the machine to dispense cash on demand without bank authorization. Of the 1,900 such incidents reported since 2020, more than 700 occurred in 2025 alone, according to a Thursday security alert [PDF].

Crims typically gain initial access via generic keys that open the ATM face, and then infect the machine with malware, either removing the ATM's hard drive and copying malware onto it before putting it back into the machine, or simply replacing the hard drive with one that's preloaded with ATM jackpotting code.

Ploutus malware, which is commonly used in these attacks, exploits eXtensions for Financial Services (XFS), an open-standard API that ATMs, POS terminals, and similar devices that run banking applications use. It allows the banking software to work across different vendors' hardware and instruct the ATM what to do - for example, send this transaction to the bank for authorization, and then dispense cash to the customer.

The malware, however, allows the attackers to issue their own commands to XFS, bypass bank authorization, and instruct the ATM to dispense cash on demand.

ATM flashes a port or two for the enterprising hacker

ATM takes a kicking yet keeps on ticking

While these attacks don't hurt banking customers - unlike skimming, which steals people's card data and PINs - ATM jackpotting does cost financial institutions tens of millions of dollars in losses. Plus, these incidents are difficult to detect until after the cash is withdrawn.

In its Thursday alert, the FBI lists several digital indicators of compromise on ATMs running Windows OS, so give those a read as they include multiple executables along with associated files and scripts. There are also several physical indicators, such as event IDs that may appear when USB storage devices are inserted into a compromised ATM, and things like no cash indicators, unauthorized devices plugged into the ATM, or removed hard drives.

As always, if you see suspicious activity or any indication of ATM jackpotting, report it to your local FBI field office at www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices or the FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center at www.ic3.gov. ®

[26] TechCrunch Security - FBI says ATM ‘jackpotting’ attacks are on the rise, and netting hackers millions in stolen cash

In 2010, the famed security researcher Barnaby Jack spectacularly hacked into an ATM cash machine onstage at the Black Hat security conference, forcing it to spit out reams of bank notes in front of an awestruck audience.

More than a decade later, ATM jackpotting — as it’s called — has broken free from the realms of theoretical security research into big business in the criminal world.

According to a new security bulletin issued by the FBI, hackers have rapidly ramped up their attacks in recent years, with more than 700 attacks on cash dispensers during 2025 alone, netting hackers at least $20 million in stolen cash.

Per the bulletin, the FBI says hackers are using a mix of physical access to ATM machines, such as generic keys for unlocking front panels and accessing hard drives, and digital tools, like planting malware that can force ATMs to rapidly dispense cash in a flash.

The FBI warned that one particular malware, known as Ploutus, affects a variety of ATM manufacturers and cash dispensers by targeting the underlying Windows operating system that powers many ATMs. Ploutus grants the hackers full control over a compromised ATM, allowing them to issue instructions capable of tricking the dispenser into disbursing notes without drawing funds from customer accounts.

Ploutus takes advantage of extensions for financial services, or XFS software, which ATMs rely on to communicate with its various other hardware components, such as the PIN keypad, the card reader, and the all-important cash dispensing unit.

“Ploutus attacks the ATM itself rather than customer accounts, enabling fast cash-out operations that can occur in minutes and are often difficult to detect until after the money is withdrawn,” per the FBI bulletin.

Security researchers previously found issues with XFS software that can allow hackers to trick ATMs into dispensing cash.

[27] TechCrunch Security - Cellebrite cut off Serbia citing abuse of its phone unlocking tools. Why not others?
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[TAM METİN - 956 kelime]
Last year, the phone hacking tool maker Cellebrite announced it had suspended Serbian police as customers, after human rights researchers alleged local police and intelligence agencies used its tools to hack into the phones of a journalist and an activist, and plant spyware.

This was a rare example of Cellebrite publicly cutting off a customer following documented allegations of abuse, citing Amnesty International’s technical report for its decision.

But following recent similar accusations of abuse in Jordan and Kenya, the Israeli-headquartered company responded by dismissing the allegations and declining to commit to investigating them. It’s unclear why Cellebrite has changed its approach, which appears contrary to its previous actions.

On Tuesday, researchers at The University of Toronto’s The Citizen Lab published a report alleging the Kenyan government used Cellebrite’s tools to unlock the phone of Boniface Mwangi, a local activist and politician, while he was in police custody. In another report from January, The Citizen Lab accused the Jordanian government of breaking into the phones of several local activists and protesters using Cellebrite’s tools.

In both investigations, the Citizen Lab, an organization that has investigated abuses of spyware and hacking technologies around the world, based their conclusions on finding traces of a specific application linked to Cellebrite on the victims’ phones.

The researchers said that those traces are a “high confidence” signal that someone used Cellebrite’s unlocking tools on the phones in question, because the same application had been previously found on VirusTotal, a malware repository, and was signed with digital certificates owned by Cellebrite.

Other researchers have also linked the same application to Cellebrite.

“We do not respond to speculation and encourage any organization with specific, evidence-based concerns to share them with us directly so we can act on them,” Victor Cooper, a spokesperson for Cellebrite, told TechCrunch in an email.

When asked why Cellebrite is acting differently from the Serbia case, Cooper said “the two situations are incomparable,” and that, “high confidence is not direct evidence.”

Cooper did not respond to multiple follow-up emails asking if Cellebrite would investigate The Citizen Lab’s latest report, and what, if any, differences there are with its case in Serbia.

In both its Kenya and Jordan investigations, The Citizen Lab reached out to Cellebrite in advance of publishing the reports to provide the company with a right to respond.

In response to the Jordan report, Cellebrite said that “any substantiated use of our tools in violation of human rights or local law will result in immediate disablement,” but did not commit to investigating the case and declined to disclose specific information about customers.

For the Kenya report, however, Cellebrite acknowledged receipt of The Citizen Lab’s inquiry but did not comment, according to John Scott-Railton, one of The Citizen Lab researchers who worked on the Cellebrite investigations.

“We urge Cellebrite to release the specific criteria they used to approve sales to Kenyan authorities, and disclose how many licenses have been revoked in the past,” Scott-Railton told TechCrunch. “If Cellebrite is serious about their rigorous vetting, they should have no problem making it public.”

Following previous reports of abuse, Cellebrite, which claims to have more than 7,000 law enforcement customers around the world, cut off relationships with Bangladesh and Myanmar, as well as Russia and Belarus during 2021. Cellebrite previously said it stopped selling to Hong Kong and China following U.S. government regulations restricting the export of sensitive technologies to the country. Local activists in Hong Kong had accused the authorities of using Cellebrite to unlock protesters’ phones.

[28] TechCrunch Security - Google says its AI systems helped deter Play Store malware in 2025

[TAM METİN - 684 kelime]
Fewer bad actors are targeting Google Play with malicious apps, the company says, a shift that the tech giant credits with its increased investments in proactive security systems and AI technology.

In its latest Android app ecosystem safety report released on Thursday, Google said it prevented 1.75 million policy-violating apps from being published on Google Play in 2025, down from 2.36 million in 2024 and 2.28 million in 2023.

The annual report offers a look at how Google is keeping Android users safe by reviewing and monitoring apps to protect against malware, financial fraud, privacy invasions, sneaky subscriptions, and other threats.

For instance, Google says it banned more than 80,000 developer accounts in 2025 that had tried to publish these types of bad apps. That figure is also down year-over-year from 158,000 in 2024, and 333,000 in 2023.

Google touted how its investments in AI and other real-time defenses have helped fight these sorts of threats, but also how they served as a deterrent.

“Initiatives like developer verification, mandatory pre-review checks, and testing requirements have raised the bar for the Google Play ecosystem, significantly reducing the paths for bad actors to enter,” the company’s blog post explained, adding that its “AI-powered, multi-layer protections” have been “discouraging bad actors from publishing malicious apps.”

Google noted it now runs over 10,000 safety checks on every app it publishes and continues to recheck apps after publication. The company has also integrated its latest generative AI models into the app review process, which has helped human reviewers find more complex malicious patterns faster. Google said it plans to increase its AI investments in 2026 to stay ahead of emerging threats.

In addition, Google said it prevented more than 255,000 apps from gaining excessive access to sensitive user data, a figure that’s down from 1.3 million in 2024. The company also blocked 160 million spam ratings and reviews last year, and prevented an average 0.5-star rating drop for apps targeted by review bombing.

Meanwhile, Android’s defense system, known as Google Play Protect, identified more than 27 million new malicious apps, and warned users or blocked the app from running. That’s an increase from the 13 million non-Play Store apps identified in 2024 and five million seen in 2023. These increases seem to suggest that bad actors are now more often avoiding the Play Store when targeting users with their malicious apps.

[29] TechCrunch Security - Sex toys maker Tenga says hacker stole customer information
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Thu, 19 Feb 2026 15:25:00 +0000
Link: https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/19/sex-toys-maker-tenga-says-hacker-stole-customer-information/

[TAM METİN - 725 kelime]
Sex toy maker Tenga notified customers of a data breach on Friday, according to an email obtained by TechCrunch.

In the message, the Japanese company said that “an unauthorized party gained access to the professional email account of one of our employees,” which gave the hacker access to the contents of the employee’s inbox. This access potentially allowed the hacker to see and steal customer names, email addresses, and historical email correspondence, “which may include order details or customer service inquiries.”

The hacker also sent spam emails to the hacked employee’s contacts, including customers, according to the email sent to customers.

After this story was published, a Tenga spokesperson told TechCrunch that the breach affected “approximately 600 people” in the United States, based on a forensic review. “We have already proactively contacted those who may have been impacted to ensure their safety and provide guidance,” said the spokesperson.

Tenga says on its website that it has shipped over 162 million products worldwide.

Order details and customer service inquiries are likely to include intimate information that many customers probably wouldn’t want to disclose, given the nature of the products in question.

The company recommended customers change their passwords, even though it did not say that customers’ passwords were compromised, and to be vigilant of suspicious emails, especially coming from a specific employee, who appears to be the one whose account was breached.

Tenga said it took several measures after the breach, including resetting the hacked employee’s credentials and enabling “across our systems,” a basic security feature called multi-factor authentication, which prevents access to accounts with stolen passwords.

The company spokesperson would not say if there was any multi-factor on the email account prior to the breach.

Tenga was founded in 2005 in Japan, and is headquartered in Tokyo. Tenga sells a variety of sex toys, mostly for men. It’s unclear if the breach affected customers outside of the United States, given that the email came explicitly from Tenga Store USA.

Tenga is the latest in a long list of sex toy makers, such as Lovense last year, and adult websites, such as Pornhub last year and SexPanther in 2020, that have been hacked.

First published on February 13. Updated with comment from Tenga spokesperson.

[30] TechCrunch Security - Bug in student admissions website exposed children’s personal information

A student admissions website used by families to enroll children into schools has fixed a security lapse that was exposing their personal information.

The website, Ravenna Hub, which lets parents apply and track the status of their kids’ applications across thousands of schools, was allowing any logged-in user to access the personally identifiable data associated with any other user, including their children.

The exposed data includes children’s names, dates of birth, addresses, pictures, and details about their school. Email addresses and phone numbers of parents, as well as information about children’s siblings, were also exposed.

Florida-based VenturEd Solutions, which develops and maintains Ravenna Hub, says on Ravenna Hub’s website that it serves over a million students, and processes hundreds of thousands of applications a year.

TechCrunch first learned of the vulnerability on Wednesday and soon after alerted the company. VenturEd fixed the bug the same day, but TechCrunch held this report until we could verify that the bug was fixed.

Nick Laird, the chief executive of VenturEd Solutions, told TechCrunch in an email that the company was able to replicate the issue and has addressed the vulnerability.

Laird said the company was investigating the incident, but he would not commit to notifying users about the security lapse, or say — when asked by TechCrunch — if the company has the ability to check if there was any improper access to other users’ data. We also asked if Ravenna Hub had its security checked by a third-party, and if so, by whom. Laird would not say, and declined to comment further.

It’s not clear who, if anyone, oversees cybersecurity at VenturEd and Ravenna Hub.

The vulnerability is known as an insecure direct object reference, or IDOR, a common security flaw that allows users to access stored information because of weak or non-existent security controls on the concerned servers.

In practice, the bug allowed any logged-in user to access another student’s data, including their personal information, by modifying the unique number associated with a student’s profile using their web browser’s address bar.

In the case of Ravenna Hub, student numbers are sequential, meaning it was possible for any user to access another student’s data by changing the profile number by one or more digits.

When TechCrunch created a new account with test data, we found that the web address contained a seven-digit number. As such, there were slightly more than 1.63 million records prior to ours that were accessible to any other user.

This is the latest security lapse involving simple security flaws affecting the personal information of children. In January, online mentoring site UStrive exposed the personal information of its users, many of whom are still in school.

Sonderkommission ermittelt zu Cyberangriff auf Kunstsammlungen Dresden

Nach dem Hackerangriff auf die Staatlichen Kunstsammlungen Dresden ermittelt nun eine Sonderkommission.

Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden

Nach dem Cyberangriff auf die Staatlichen Kunstsammlungen Dresden in diesem Januar hat das Landeskriminalamt Sachsen (LKA) eine Sonderkommission gegründet. Diese führe auch die Ermittlungen unter Sachleitung der Generalstaatsanwaltschaft Dresden, wie die Ermittlungsbehörde mitteilte. Weitergehende Angaben machte die Generalstaatsanwaltschaft nicht.

Am 21. Januar waren die Staatlichen Kunstsammlungen Dresden (SKD) Opfer eines Cyberangriffs geworden. Betroffen waren den damaligen Angaben zufolge weite Teile der digitalen Infrastruktur, der Onlineshop und der Besucherservice, nicht jedoch das Sicherheitssystem.

Die SKD teilte auf Anfrage mit, dass die uneingeschränkte Aufmerksamkeit der Sicherheit der Sammlungen gelte. Diese werde in enger Zusammenarbeit mit dem Sicherheitsunternehmen gewährleistet. Details zum Sicherheitskonzept wurden nicht genannt. “Die Sicherheit unserer Besucherinnen und Besucher in den Einrichtungen der SKD sowie der uns anvertrauten Kunstschätze ist umfassend gewahrt”, hieß es weiter.

Die Staatlichen Kunstsammlungen Dresden sind ein Verbund von 15 Museen. Dazu gehören unter anderem die Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister im Zwinger sowie die Galerie Neue Meister im Albertinum und das Grüne Gewölbe im Dresdner Residenzschloss. (dpa/jm)

[32] CSO Online - PayPal launches latest struggle to get rid of SMS for MFA

PayPal launches latest struggle to get rid of SMS for MFA

Security experts have been nearly unanimous in their dislike of unencrypted SMS authentication for over a decade, but business executives — and customers — love its convenience. Cost-cutting may finally do it in for enterprise SMS usage.

When PayPal started emailing customers this month that it was backing off unencrypted SMS for multifactor authentication (MFA) at login, it came with the typical approach-avoidance asterisk.

The financial services giant signaled that it was turning the page on the much-maligned authentication method while simultaneously offering no timeline and assuring customers SMS wouldn’t entirely go away — a curious strategy that could help smooth over customer loss.

SMS has a long history of opposition from security executives, mostly pointing to how easily it can be sniffed and subject to man-in-the-middle attacks, among others. As a result, Google has backed off SMS, as has Microsoft, Cisco, and even the United Arab Emirates Central Bank.

“SMS as an authentication factor is devil spawn and should be banned by an act of Congress,” says Gary Longsine, CEO at IllumineX, encapsulating the frustration of many security specialists.

Still, SMS remains, largely due to convenience, given that many business executives fear any change to MFA processes will be viewed as friction that could lead to customer loss or reduced engagement.

“They don’t want to lose users who won’t do anything other than SMS as a second factor,” says cybersecurity consultant Brian Levine, a former federal prosecutor who today serves as executive director of FormerGov. “Although app-based MFA is generally considered more secure than SMS-based MFA, not all users are willing to take the time to set up app-based MFA, so making it an absolute requirement tends to result in fewer conversions.”

Garret Grajek, CEO of access certification firm YouAttest, has experienced this business unit pushback directly.

“We designed a very strong authentication and the CISO loved it, but the security teams did not want to push back against user requests” for unencrypted SMS, he says, adding that a business unit executive argued that the security boost “is going to cost us money.”

“I feel sorry for PayPal because they [are a victim of] the battles that go on in business units versus security. And security doesn’t always win,” he adds.

Muddled effort, mixed messages

Flavio Villanustre, CISO for the LexisNexis Risk Solutions Group, says he’s “always found it odd” that PayPal still supports SMS as its primary secondary authentication factor.

“Everyone in financial services and government has abandoned it for not being sufficiently secure and are moving to even phishing-resistant authentication, such as passkeys, Yubikeys,” he explains.

PayPal’s shift was announced via email sent to some customers earlier this month. “Starting March 2026, we’ll start removing SMS codes [for login MFA] but they’ll still be available as part of our standard security checks,” PayPal’s email said.

PayPal’s reference to standard security checks refers to when its system, leveraging behavioral analytics, flags a customer interaction as potentially fraudulent based on factors such as transaction size or deviation from historic patterns.

Still, Grajek finds PayPal’s decision to keep SMS in use for fraud checks to be odd. When the system flags a potential problem, he says, “you want to do a higher level [of authentication]. Why would you de-escalate [to a lower level of authentication]?”

PayPal declined to comment on the record for this story, but a PayPal official did discuss elements of the company’s SMS decision under the condition of not being identified.

PayPal’s customer email said the company would “start removing” SMS in March, but how long that process will take is unclear. Logistics is one factor, as these communications are going to a global customer base of roughly 439 million people and businesses. “We will batch it out over a long time,” the PayPal official stated.

PayPal will likely also assess customer reaction, giving itself flexibility by not committing to a firm end date.

PayPal’s email suggested that customers switch their MFA method to an authenticator app or a onetime-password-issuing fob such as those compliant with FIDO2 security keys. Strangely, the email instructed security key users to “Put the device into your USB slot and you’re all set,” despite the fact that mobile devices communicate with keys via NFC or mobile connectors, not via USB slots, and most users transact with PayPal via mobile devices.

The PayPal email also instructed customers to “update your verification method at paypal.com. Log in to your account and use the gear icon to go to security settings and update your 2-step verification.” The problem? When the email was received, that security page offered no direct way to make the change.

Customer service suggested to customers that they could deactivate MFA entirely and then reactivate it. That less-than-secure option did work and the user was then able to make the change. Further testing revealed that a user could click the “add a new device” button, even if they had no intention of adding a new device. That also presented a screen where the customer could change their MFA method.

Melody Brue, principal analyst for Moor Insights & Strategy, says using SMS can still be valuable for some isolated situations, but that PayPal appears to be trying to have it both ways.

“It sounds to me that they are trying to soften the blow of saying ‘SMS isn’t safe enough.’ They are saying that you can’t use it to verify who you are unless we are worried that you are not you,” Brue says. “They are clearly actively inching away from SMS. They have to do that. They have to align with new standards. In financial services you don’t even want to mess around with” SMS.

Financial cost of SMS may be final straw

But Brue also referred to another reason PayPal may be stepping back from SMS authentication: cost reduction. Sending SMS messages involves hard costs for PayPal, whereas telling customers to authenticate with a FIDO2 key or an authenticator app is free for the company.

The cost of individual SMS messages is low — for example, AWS charges a fraction of a penny for each message. But given that PayPal handles about 25 billion transactions a year, those fractions quickly add up.

Also, attackers test PayPal systems routinely “and they can trigger millions of SMS codes,” Brue adds. “For a company under new leadership and especially margin sensitive right now, sending millions of codes to bots that are not needed? That is an easy line to cut and it’s an OPEX win.”

Justin Greis, CEO of consulting firm Acceligence and former head of the North American cybersecurity practice at McKinsey, says his main concern with SMS authentication is “SIM swapping, SIM jacking — we have seen that go up.”

“PayPal is one of the most spoofed and spammed emails out there,” he adds.

Steven Eric Fisher, an independent cybersecurity and risk advisor who served as the director of cybersecurity, risk, and compliance for Walmart until August 2025, agrees about SMS’s many authentication drawbacks, dubbing SMS “a very low bar of protection.” But he is less enthusiastic than most about authenticator apps.

Authenticator apps “are only marginally better than SMS. Each has its own faults,” Fisher says. “FIDO2 is the best option from a security standpoint but end user adoption” may slow down because the customer has to pay for each FIDO2 device “as well as [experience] the difficulty placed on the user for the enrollment and use.”

10 Passwordless-Optionen für Unternehmen

Passwordless Authentication kann das Sicherheitsniveau Ihres Unternehmens entscheidend verbessern. Diese Lösungen sollten Sie kennen.

Um Passwörter hinter sich zu lassen, gibt es bessere Lösungen. Wir zeigen Ihnen zehn.

Foto: Raffi Ilham Pratama – shutterstock.com

Passwörter sind seit Jahrzehnten der Authentifizierungsstandard für Computersysteme, obwohl sie sich immer wieder aufs Neue als anfällig für diverse Cyberangriffsformen erwiesen haben und kompromittierte Benutzerkonten auf regelmäßiger Basis zum Einfallstor für kriminelle Hacker werden. Ein Mittel für CISOs, um diesem Problem zu begegnen, ist die passwortlose Authentifizierung. Lösungen in diesem Bereich versprechen:

die Benutzersicherheit zu erhöhen und

die Benutzersicherheit zu erhöhen und

parallel die Belastung zu eliminieren, die für User und Helpdesk durch komplexe Passwörter entsteht.

parallel die Belastung zu eliminieren, die für User und Helpdesk durch komplexe Passwörter entsteht.

Geht es um Passwordless Authentication, führt kein Weg an der FIDO Alliance vorbei. Die Non-Profit-Organisation managt und unterstützt mehrere (Passwordless-) Sicherheitsstandards für verschiedene Use Cases – darunter FIDO2 und Passkeys. Letzteres stellt eine Weiterentwicklung von ersterem dar und wird sich aller Voraussicht nach branchenübergreifend als Standard durchsetzen. Derzeit unterstützen bereits diverse Unternehmen Passkeys, darunter etwa Apple, Google, Microsoft, Github, Docusign sowie diverse Sicherheitsanbieter.

10 Passwordless-Authentication-Lösungen

Sollten Sie sich grundsätzlich für “Passwordless” entschieden haben, stellt sich die Frage, welcher Anbieter, beziehungsweise welches Offering für Ihr Unternehmen am besten geeignet ist. Bei Ihrer Entscheidungsfindung kann Sie ein Blick auf eines der folgenden zehn Angebote unter Umständen weiterbringen.

AuthID Verified Workforce

Mit Verified Workforce bietet der US-Sicherheitsanbieter AuthID mehrere Schlüsselfunktionen rund um die Authentifizierung von Benutzern – mit starkem Fokus auf biometrische Sicherheitsmerkmale. Dank KI-gestützter Matching-Fähigkeiten verspricht die Lösung dabei auch Spoofing-Versuche zu erkennen.

AuthID unterstützt den FIDO2-Standard, wobei Krypto-Keys auf dem jeweiligen Gerät generiert und gespeichert werden – die Cloud bleibt komplett außen vor. Weil man bei AuthID weiß, dass Passwordless ohne ein größeres Ökosystem nur von begrenztem Wert ist, ist die AuthID-Lösung auch mit Identity- und Access-Management (IAM) -Tools von Drittanbietern integrierbar.

Mit seiner Authentifizierungsplattform verfolgt Axiad einen ganzheitlichen Ansatz zur Passwordless-Orchestrierung. Dabei konsolidiert Axiad Conductor vorhandene IAM-Suiten, um den Übergang ins Passwordless-Zeitalter zu erleichtern – sowohl, wenn es um die Konfiguration als auch wenn es darum geht, neue Benutzer bereitzustellen. Die Lösung bietet darüber hinaus ein Admin- und ein Endbenutzer-Portal, über das sich Authentifizierungs-Workflows granular anpassen lassen.

Sicherheitsanbieter Beyond Identity kombiniert passwortlose Authentifizierung mit kontinuierlicher, risikobasierter Authentifizierung. Das hat zur Folge, dass jeder Authentifizierungsversuch auf Grundlage des jeweiligen Kontextes bewertet wird – also etwa dem verwendeten Device oder dem aktuellen Standort des Benutzers.

Darüber hinaus nutzt die Lösung von Beyond Identity auch vorhandene Hardware wie Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs), um kryptografische Schlüssel noch besser zu schützen. Davon abgesehen unterstützt der Anbieter auch die Integration mit IAM-Suiten sowie Active Directory Federation Services, um eine passwortlose Authentifizierung bei On-Premise-Applikationen zu realisieren.

CyberArk Workforce Identity

Mit Workforce Identity (früher unter der Marke Idaptive bekannt) unterstützt CyberArk mit seinem Software-Agenten alle Passwordless-Anwendungsfälle – inklusive Endpoint Authentication. Zum Angebot von CyberArk gehört auch ein Applikations-Gateway, das die sichere Authentifizierung bei On-Premises-Anwendungen erleichtern soll. Außerdem erwähnenswert: Adaptive Authentifizierungsfunktionen, die es dem Anbieter nach eigener Aussage ermöglichen, die im jeweiligen Kontext angemessenen Authentifizierungsfaktoren dynamisch auszuwählen.

Ciscos populärer MFA-Service Duo unterstützt jeden erdenklichen Authentifizierungs-Use-Case inklusive Desktop, Webanwendungen, VPN- und Remote-Verbindungen. Dabei bietet Duo auch die Tools, die nötig sind, um andere wichtige Authentifizierungsaspekte berücksichtigen zu können: kontextbezogene, risikobasierte Authentifizierung, Monitoring und Integration mit praktisch jeder IAM-Suite auf dem Markt.

Die Authentifizierungsplattform HYPR unterstützt den Passkey-Standard vollumfänglich, allerdings nur als Startpunkt für die Authentifizierung. Dabei werden sowohl synchronisierte als auch gerätegebundene Passkeys für die Authentifizierung unterstützt. Passwortlose Authentifizierung erstreckt sich bei HYPR über sämtliche Bereiche, von Desktop- bis hin zu Remote-Access-Lösungen.

Um Authenticators im gesamten Unternehmen zu managen und Richtlinien entsprechend anzupassen, steht Anwendern mit dem HYPR Control Center eine intuitive Administrationskonsole zur Verfügung. Die Plattform unterstützt darüber hinaus die Integration mit bestehenden IAM-Systemen und -Tools.

Okta ist im Identity- und Authentifizierungs-Game ein Big Player und hält ein umfassendes Serviceangebot bereit, das in diesem Bereich quasi jede Anforderung erfüllt. Die Plattform bietet vollwertige IAM-Funktionen, Multifaktor-Authentifizierung (MFA) und alle anderen Komponenten, die für eine vollständige Passwordless-Lösung erforderlich sind.

Dynamische, beziehungsweise anpassbare Workflows, Authentifizierungsrichtlinien und -faktoren versprechen den Anwendern dabei maximale Flexibilität. Erwähnenswert ist darüber hinaus “Okta Fastpass“: Diese Lösung ermöglicht den Anwendern, mobile Geräte schnell und einfach als Authentifikatoren zu registrieren. Darüber hinaus bietet Okta auch Support für die Verkettung von Authentifizierungsfaktoren mit Faktor-Sequenzierung. Diese Technik kann auch mit Richtlinien gepaart werden, um den Zugriff auf kritische Informationen in besonderem Maße abzusichern.

Auch Ping Identity gehört zu den “Großen” in Sachen Identity und Authentifizierung und stellt eine vollumfängliche Tool-Suite zur Verfügung, die sämtliche Aspekte des Authentifizierungsprozesses abdeckt. Mit “PingOne Davinci” kann der Anbieter auch mit visuellen Authentifizierungs-Workflows aufwarten (basierend auf Templates).

Bei Ping Identity hält man nichts davon, überstürzt von heute auf morgen alles auf Passwordless umzustellen – stattdessen ermutigt das Unternehmen seine Kunden dazu, sich schrittweise einer passwortlosen Zukunft anzunähern.

Secret Double Octopus

Der israelische MFA- und Passwordless-Spezialist Secret Double Octopus verspricht passwortlose Authentifizierung für alle wichtigen Anwendungsfälle mit nur minimalen Änderungen an der bestehenden Infrastruktur zu realisieren. Dabei unterstützt die Lösung auch die passwortlose Authentifizierung für RDP und SSH, On-Premises-Legacy-Anwendungen und andere weniger gängige Use Cases. Weil Secret Double Octopus auch Passwordless Authentication in Offline-Netzwerkumgebungen unterstützt, bleiben sogar Air-Gapped-Netzwerke nicht außen vor.

Yubico hat mit seinen Yubikey-Tokens einen De-Facto-Standard für Hardware-Authentifizierungs-Tools geschaffen (der übrigens auch von den meisten hier vorgestellten Lösungen unterstützt wird). Yubikeys sind in einer Vielzahl von Formfaktoren erhältlich und unterstützen zahlreiche Konnektivitätsstandards wie USB-A, USB-C oder NFC. Darüber hinaus bietet das Unternehmen auch Services für Großkunden an, wenn es darum geht, die Hardware Tokens bereitzustellen und zu managen.

New phishing campaign tricks employees into bypassing Microsoft 365 MFA

Unwitting employees register a hacker’s device to their account; the crook then uses the resulting OAuth tokens to maintain persistent access.

Another device code phishing campaign that abuses OAuth device registration to bypass multifactor authentication login protections has been discovered.

Researchers at KnowBe4 say the campaign is largely targeting North American businesses and professionals by tricking unwitting employees into clicking a link in an email from a threat actor.

The message purports to be about a corporate electronic funds payment, a document about salary bonuses, a voicemail, or contains some other lure. It also includes a code for ‘Secure Authorization’ that the user is asked to enter when they click on the link, which takes them to a real Microsoft Office 365 login page.

Victims think the message is legitimate, because the login page is legitimate, so enter the code. But unknown to the victim, it’s actually the code for a device controlled by the threat actor. What the victim has done is issued an OAuth token granting the hacker’s device access to their Microsoft account. From there, the hacker has access to everything the account allows the employee to use.

Note that this isn’t about credential theft, although if the attacker wants credentials, they can be stolen. It’s about stealing the victim’s OAuth access and refresh tokens for persistent access to their Microsoft account, including to applications such as Outlook, Teams, and OneDrive.

It works because certain sites, including Microsoft 365, use the OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Grant process to allow the adding of devices to an account. It’s similar to the way a home owner adds a smart TV to Netflix.

KnowBe4 calls it a novel attack, although Johannes Ullrich, dean of research at the SANS Institute, called it “old new.”

According to Trend Micro, a threat actor dubbed Pawn Storm has been leveraging OAuth in phishing campaigns since as far back as 2015. And in 2020, Microsoft warned users about what it called ‘consent phishing,’ in which threat actors seek permission for an attacker-controlled app to access data by installing an OAuth 2.0 provider. Ullrich admitted a SANS employee fell for one of these phishing emails.

The main defense against the latest version of this attack is to restrict the applications users are allowed to connect to their account, he said. Microsoft provides enterprise administrators with the ability to allowlist specific applications that the user may authorize via OAuth.

Roger Grimes, CISO advisor at KnowBe4, wrote about device code phishing in 2020. In an interview Thursday, he said what’s distinctive about the latest tactic is that the victim logs into a valid domain, and the goal is to get the user’s device token.

“The user’s not doing anything wrong,” in the sense that they are logging into a legitimate portal, he said. “If they look at the URL they’re logging into, it’s microsoft.com. But the attacker has pre-registered their device to get the code for [the victim] to verify.”

David Shipley, head of Canadian security awareness training provider Beauceron Security, said OAuth device code attacks have been gaining steam since 2024. “It’s the natural evolutionary response to improvements in account security, particularly MFA”, he said.

The easiest defense is to turn off the ability to add extra login devices to Office 365, unless it’s needed, he said.

In addition, employees should also be continuously educated about the risks of unusual login requests, even if they come from a familiar system.

“The value of teaching people about new social engineering techniques like this, and doing phishing simulations based on these kinds of attack, is it gets people used to reporting them, which will help when real attacks are happening,” he added.

Cory Michal, CSO at AppOmni, said attacks often leverage OAuth tokens and service/integration identities because they are a blind spot for many organizations that have invested heavily in identity hardening and multifactor authentication.

“OAuth tokens often operate as bearer credentials,” he noted. “If an attacker obtains them, they can be used as a single-factor access method to act as the integration without triggering an interactive login or MFA challenge, and the activity can blend into normal API/integration patterns. In other words, strong MFA enforcement can coexist with a persistent exposure if non-human identities and OAuth token hygiene aren’t governed and monitored with the same rigor.”

He said that IT leaders need to go beyond classic third-party vendor reviews, and actually inventory and audit the integrations running in their SaaS environments, determining which apps are connected, what OAuth scopes/permissions they have, and whether they’re still needed.

“Most teams have far more integrations than they realize, and many retain broad privileges long after the original business need,” he pointed out.

“In parallel, we should raise the security bar for any SaaS vendor we rely on, [with] clear requirements around token security, logging, incident response, and secure integration patterns, and make sure our own tenant configurations and monitoring are hardened so integration activity is least-privilege, observable, and quickly containable when something upstream is compromised,” Michal added.

Grimes said that users can be educated to check how many devices are authorized to access their Microsoft, Google, and other login accounts. They should also be continually warned to be suspicious of email links that go to a login page.

In a blog about device code phishing, he noted that Microsoft Entra administrators can disable “device code flow” in their conditional access policies. This disables all users of device codes for Entra, not just malicious users. This means users will have to log in and provide more information than just a device code, but it will better protect an IT environment from this type of phishing attack.

[35] CSO Online - US dominance of agentic AI at the heart of new NIST initiative

US dominance of agentic AI at the heart of new NIST initiative

The standards body is soliciting industry views on agentic security risks while ‘cementing US dominance at the technological frontier.’

This week, the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) announced a new listening exercise, the AI Agent Standards Initiative, which it hopes will provide a roadmap for addressing agentic AI hurdles and, it said, ensure that the technology “is widely adopted with confidence.”

AI agents, which have now ascended to the status of enterprise tools, are designed to be autonomous and powerful: ambiguous but ominous concepts where boundaries and limits are not always easy to define or understand. The risk this poses in terms of misuse, error, and unintended consequences is striking.

However, working under the direction of the Center for AI Standards and Innovation (CAISI), set up within NIST last June to replace the Biden administration’s US AI Safety Institute, the AI Agent Standards Initiative’s remit will be broader than security alone.

Although appearing to be a re-naming of the existing initiative, CAISI’s mandate is now wider, and more overtly political. Bluntly, “CAISI aims to foster the emerging ecosystem of industry-led AI standards and protocols while cementing US dominance at the technological frontier,” said NIST’s press release.

This will mean fostering the US’s leadership in international standards bodies, open-source AI agent development, and advancing research into AI agent security and use cases. Interoperability – the ability of agents from different companies to work together – will also be a priority.

“Absent confidence in the reliability of AI agents and interoperability among agents and digital resources, innovators may face a fragmented ecosystem and stunted adoption,” NIST said. “To address this concern, NIST, including CAISI, aims to foster industry-led technical standards and protocols that build public trust in AI agents, catalyze an interoperable agent ecosystem, and diffuse their benefits to all Americans and across the world.”

Stories of agentic AI missteps have been hard to miss recently, from the 2025 ‘EchoLeak’ vulnerability in which Microsoft 365 Copilot was used to exfiltrate data, to the sudden popularity of OpenClaw (formerly known as Moltbot and Clawdbot), a helpful agent which also opens a door for attackers to roam unseen around a user’s applications and data.

And in November, the Information Technology Industry Council, a global trade association, identified a wide range of agentic security and accountability risks including ‘jagged intelligence,’ the tendency of AI models to complete complex tasks while failing at much simpler ones. These errors could expose enterprises to unpredictable failures in automated environments, it said.

According to Gary Phipps, head of customer success at agentic AI security startup Helmet Security, a problem with NIST is that its initiatives are being outpaced by real-world developments. “History says that anything NIST comes up with will likely not emerge fast enough to address agentic AI,” said Phipps.

“From the time NIST announced it was working on the AI Risk Management Framework to the day it published the final version was roughly two years,” he noted. “In that same window, the entire generative AI landscape was born, scaled, and began reshaping enterprise security. Now we’re doing it again with agentic AI, and NIST’s answer is more RFIs, more listening sessions, more convening.”

NIST has issued a request for information (RFI) on agentic AI threats, safeguards, and assessment methods; input is due by March 9. In addition, CAISI will hold “listening sessions” in April on sector-specific barriers to AI adoption, NIST said.

NIST’s statement about “cementing US dominance at the technological frontier” is, Phipps said, “a bold thing to say about an initiative whose first concrete deliverable is a listening session in April.”

He pointed out, “Standards don’t create dominance: they follow it. The AI Risk Management Framework (RMF) is proof. It took two years to produce, and by the time it was final, the industry had largely already formed its own views on AI risk.”

Enterprises are under pressure to modernize networks for hybrid, multi‑cloud and AI workloads. This modernization and these new demands require critical services like DNS, DHCP and IP address management (DDI) to evolve—without disruption. Over the past quarter, Infoblox has expanded the Infoblox Universal DDI™ Product Suite and NIOS with new integrations, views and automation capabilities that help teams move faster, reduce risk and operate from a single, authoritative control plane.

This roundup highlights key updates across Universal DDI, and Infoblox NIOS, including:

A better together approach to Microsoft DNS/DHCP management, allowing customers to modernize at their own pace

Unified IP address management (IPAM) across AWS and Google Cloud, eliminating overlapping IPs and speeding hybrid deployments

A broadened External Authoritative DNS portfolio that brings Infoblox resiliency and security to public‑facing services

New NIOS 9.0.8 feature enhancements and Proxmox qualification

Expanded automation with Swagger/OpenAPI, Terraform and VMware Aria to make both Universal DDI and NIOS more programmable and AI‑ready

New Network and Address Space Perspectives and configuration management database (CMDB) reconciliation capabilities to improve visibility and data quality across hybrid estates

Advancing the Universal DDI Story

A recent survey by Enterprise Management Associates found 67.5 percent of respondents want full overlay management of native public cloud DNS in their core DDI stack.

Survey respondents indicated that one of their top DNS challenges was the lack of integrated management across on‑prem and cloud DNS. More than half had downtime in the last two years due to mismanagement of DNS, DHCP or IP address space, and more than 4 in 10 suffered a security breach tied to DDI mismanagement.

Directly aligned with these needs and challenges, in our November Universal DDI announcements, Infoblox expanded on our vision and strategy for transforming DDI into a unified, software as a service (SaaS)‑managed foundation for hybrid, multi‑cloud and AI‑driven IT. Universal DDI provides that foundation by:

Centralizing management of DNS, DHCP and IPAM across on‑premises NIOS, cloud platforms and external DNS providers through a single portal and API

Breaking down silos between NetOps, CloudOps and SecOps so they can share data, policies and workflows instead of working from separate tools and spreadsheets

Giving organizations an “AI‑ready” DDI layer, where rich DNS, DHCP and IPAM telemetry can feed analytics, security and automation platforms

This quarter’s updates, starting with several key capabilities that were first introduced in the November announcements, deepen that story with concrete ways to modernize legacy environments, unify IP management and harden external DNS without forcing disruptive rip‑and‑replace projects.

Modernize Microsoft DNS and DHCP at Your Pace

Many organizations still run DNS and DHCP on Windows Server, where those services are tightly coupled to Active Directory. That model was never designed for hybrid, multi‑cloud networks, but fully replacing it can feel too risky or expensive in the near term.

Universal DDI Management for Microsoft addresses this by letting customers modernize how they manage Microsoft DNS and DHCP—without forcing them to change where those services run. Universal DDI can now manage Windows Server DNS and DHCP configurations, alongside other cloud and external DNS services, via a single UI and API.

Businesses can immediately modernize and centralize the management of critical network services without disruption, and then follow a clear, low-risk path to evolving their DNS/DHCP architecture at their own pace.

Unifying IP Address Management across AWS and Google Cloud

Amazon VPC IPAM Integration: One Source of Truth for Hybrid IPAM

As organizations move workloads into AWS, IP address management is often split between on‑premises tools and the Amazon VPC IP Address Manager service. That can lead to overlapping IP ranges, slow provisioning and incomplete visibility.

The new Infoblox Universal IP Address Management™ integration with Amazon VPC IPAM closes that gap:

NetOps uses Universal IP Address Management (IPAM) to allocate IPv4 blocks for AWS VPCs and write them into Amazon VPC IPAM from the Infoblox Portal, preserving a single, authoritative IP plan.

CloudOps continues to work inside native AWS interfaces (Management Console, CLI, SDKs) while requesting address blocks that have already been validated as unique and conflict‑free.

The integration automatically checks for overlapping ranges before assignments, reducing the risk of outages caused by conflicting IP space between on‑premises and AWS networks.

Combined with Infoblox Universal Asset Insights™, customers can correlate IP data with asset and security context across environments to improve planning, troubleshooting and governance.

Google Internal Range Integration: Smarter IP Planning in Google Cloud

In Google Cloud, rapid growth in VPCs, peering relationships and Kubernetes clusters makes it easy to lose track of which address blocks are used where—and to inadvertently introduce conflicts between cloud and on‑premises networks.

The Google Internal Range integration for Universal IPAM is designed to solve exactly that:

Universal IPAM now discovers Google Cloud VPC networks and internal ranges, giving NetOps a single place to see how IP space is used across Google environments.

NetOps teams can plan and reserve address blocks centrally in Universal IPAM, then define the corresponding Google internal ranges directly from the Infoblox Portal.

The integration also surfaces VPC peering relationships and subnet mappings, improving visibility into how ranges are connected and helping prevent routing and overlap issues as environments grow.

Together, the AWS VPC IPAM and Google Internal Range integrations give customers a cohesive IP plan across on‑premises, AWS and Google Cloud, all enforced by a single Universal IPAM engine.

External Authoritative DNS: Unified Management, Security and Resilience

Critical customer‑facing applications—websites, APIs, SaaS services and email—depend on external authoritative DNS that often lives in different places than internal DNS. Historically, many organizations have:

Hosted external DNS themselves on NIOS

Used one or more SaaS DNS provider (e.g., Cloudflare, Akamai)

Managed those environments separately from internal DNS and IPAM

The expanded Infoblox for External Authoritative DNS portfolio brings these worlds together and strengthens defenses at the same time. Key capabilities include:

Unified DNS Management across Internal and External Environments
Universal DDI Management now supports DNS records not only for internal environments, Amazon Route 53, Azure DNS and Google Cloud DNS, but also for leading external DNS SaaS providers such as Cloudflare and Akamai. That means teams can: 

See and manage DNS for internal networks, public‑facing apps and multi‑cloud environments through one API and the Infoblox Portal
Apply consistent workflows and automation to changes, reducing configuration errors—the top cause of downtime in many environments

See and manage DNS for internal networks, public‑facing apps and multi‑cloud environments through one API and the Infoblox Portal

Apply consistent workflows and automation to changes, reducing configuration errors—the top cause of downtime in many environments

Redundancy for External DNS
Many businesses rely on external DNS to keep their websites, email and other internet‑connected services online. But even the largest external DNS providers can experience outages. Infoblox eliminates this single point of failure with a hybrid-hosted external DNS architecture that runs SaaS‑hosted and self‑hosted DNS in parallel, so websites and public‑facing applications remain available even if a primary external DNS provider has a catastrophic outage.

DNS Infrastructure Protection for Self‑Hosted External DNS 
For organizations that host their own external authoritative servers on NIOS, Infoblox DNS Infrastructure Protection (formerly Advanced DNS Protection, or ADP) provides adaptive defenses against volumetric and protocol‑level DNS attacks, such as distributed denial of service (DDoS), hijacking and cache poisoning. It is designed to keep legitimate queries flowing even while infrastructure is under attack, so web, email and other external services remain available.

By unifying internal and external DNS operations while hardening exposed infrastructure, customers gain clearer visibility across their digital estate and stronger business continuity in the face of outages or cyberattacks.

NIOS-X and NIOS-X as a Service Maintenance and Security Enhancements

To provide additional flexibility and control over updates, NIOS‑X now supports sequential software updates. Updates are applied to one server at a time across all update types, including scheduled updates, ensuring that each update completes successfully before the next begins. If you prefer a different approach for a specific maintenance window, you can temporarily disable sequential updates and then easily restore them for future cycles. For information, see Scheduling Software Updates for Servers.

New Perspectives in Universal IPAM and CMDB Reconciliation

As networks span more locations, clouds and business units, teams need better visual and analytical tools to understand where IP space is used and whether configuration data is trustworthy.

This quarter, Universal DDI introduces two new Universal IPAM perspectives and an important enhancement in Universal Asset Insights:

Network Perspective provides a hierarchical view of IP networks and subnets across on‑premises and cloud, making it easier to see utilization patterns, fragmentation and potential overlaps.

Address Space Perspective organizes IP usage by address spaces instead of physical topology, which is especially helpful for multi‑cloud and overlapping private ranges where traditional network diagrams fall short.

CMDB Reconciliation (via Universal Asset Insights) compares ServiceNow CMDB records with live discovery data. Assets are automatically categorized as:

Present in both ServiceNow and Infoblox (healthy) 
Listed in ServiceNow but not observed on the network (likely stale or decommissioned)
Active on the network but missing from ServiceNow (coverage gaps)

Present in both ServiceNow and Infoblox (healthy)

Listed in ServiceNow but not observed on the network (likely stale or decommissioned)

Active on the network but missing from ServiceNow (coverage gaps)

These capabilities help teams clean up data, reduce blind spots and make better decisions about capacity, compliance and incident response.

Driving Agility through Automation: Swagger, Terraform and VMware Aria

In the same Enterprise Management Associates survey referred to previously, nearly two‑thirds of the respondents indicated that automated DDI management is “very important,” and over 97 percent call DDI automation at least somewhat important.

Automation remains a central pillar of Infoblox’s strategy for both Universal DDI and NIOS. As hybrid, multi‑cloud environments grow, manual workflows for DNS and IPAM simply can’t keep up with the speed of application delivery.

Recent automation enhancements include:

NIOS Swagger/OpenAPI Support
Starting with NIOS 9.0.6, NIOS exposes OpenAPI‑compliant specifications and a Swagger UI experience for its APIs, giving developers an interactive way to discover endpoints, test calls in the browser and auto‑generate client SDKs. This lays the groundwork for AI‑driven automation that can interpret APIs programmatically.

Terraform Provider Updates for NIOS and Universal DDI
Infoblox has redesigned the Terraform Provider for NIOS, adding full API coverage and stronger resource validation to make infrastructure‑as‑code (IaC) deployments more reliable. At the same time, the Terraform Provider for Universal DDI now supports tag‑based filtering when requesting the next available address, subnet or block, improving flexibility in dynamic, multi‑cloud environments.

VMware Aria Automation Provider for Universal DDI 
A new VMware Aria Automation Provider integrates Universal DDI directly into VMware Aria workflows, automating IP allocation, DNS record creation and DHCP reservations as part of virtual machine provisioning and deprovisioning. This reduces manual steps, cuts configuration errors and ensures critical network services are delivered consistently as virtual infrastructure changes.

Together, these automation capabilities help customers reduce manual work, standardize workflows and plug DDI into their broader continuous integration (CI)/continuous delivery (CD), cloud and orchestration pipelines, across both Universal DDI and NIOS.

NIOS 9.0.8 and the Long‑Term Support Experience

NIOS remains a cornerstone for customers that rely on robust, on‑premises and virtualized DDI deployments. Recent updates balance more deployment choice with an improved support and upgrade model.

NIOS on Proxmox: More Choice for Virtualized DDI

With NIOS 9.0.8, Infoblox has qualified NIOS on Proxmox Virtual Environment (VE), adding another option alongside VMware, KVM, Nutanix, OpenStack and others. This is particularly valuable for organizations:

Looking to diversify away from a single hypervisor vendor for cost, control or risk reasons

Standardizing on Proxmox—an open‑source platform that tightly integrates KVM and Linux containers (LXC), offers SDN, high availability (HA) and both REST API/CLI and web UI options

Infoblox Engineering has validated NIOS on Proxmox in the lab and in coordination with internal IT teams that were already adopting Proxmox, confirming consistent performance and behavior compared to existing KVM deployments.

Long‑Term Support (LTS) for NIOS: Streamlined Upgrades and Fewer Surprises

Alongside feature releases, Infoblox has also introduced a Long‑Term Support (LTS) program for NIOS, beginning with the 9.0.6 release train. The program is designed to make it easier for customers to plan upgrades and maintain a stable, secure DDI foundation:

Two‑year support lifespan from the release of each new LTS version, giving customers a predictable window for planning upgrades

A unified update experience that replaces separate paths for major upgrades and consolidated hotfixes (CHFs), simplifying maintenance and reducing the potential for errors

An improved upgrade workflow that automatically checks for configuration issues (such as invalid certificates or misconfigurations) before upgrades proceed, helping prevent failed change windows

Richer logging during upgrades, enabling Infoblox Support to troubleshoot more quickly if problems arise

For customers deploying NIOS 9.0.8 on Proxmox or other hypervisors, pairing those capabilities with the LTS program gives a clear path to modern, resilient DDI with fewer upgrade events.

Universal DDI 26.2 Release Updates

The latest 26.2 release adds several capabilities that further strengthen resiliency, multi‑cloud reach and operational visibility across Universal DDI and NIOS‑X:

NIOS‑X: DHCP Ping Before Offer
NIOS‑X DHCP servers can now verify that an IP address is not already in use before offering it to a client. By probing the candidate address and automatically skipping any IPs that are active on the network, this feature helps prevent conflicts in environments with unmanaged or manually configured devices and improves overall stability for end users.

Universal DDI: Microsoft and NIOS DHCP Lease Visibility
Universal DDI now discovers and surfaces DHCP leases from both Microsoft and NIOS DHCP servers in the Infoblox Portal. This unified, real‑time lease visibility simplifies troubleshooting, accelerates root‑cause analysis and enables richer on‑premises reporting across mixed DHCP environments.

What Does It All Mean?

Taken together, these innovations show how Infoblox is executing on a clear vision, strategy and roadmap:

Modernize without Disruption: Start by centralizing management of Microsoft DNS/DHCP and external DNS, then evolve underlying infrastructure on your own timetable.

Unify IP Visibility across Every Cloud: Use Universal IPAM and integrations with Amazon VPC IPAM and Google Internal Range to maintain a single IP source of truth across AWS, Google Cloud and on‑premises networks.

Automate Everything You Can: Leverage Swagger/OpenAPI, Terraform and VMware Aria integration across both Universal DDI and NIOS to move DNS, DHCP and IPAM firmly into your automation toolchain.

Stabilize Your Core with LTS: Adopt NIOS Long‑Term Support releases to reduce upgrade frequency, gain more predictable support windows and improve reliability during change events.

Customer Spotlight: Standardizing DNS at a Global Infrastructure Provider

A global operator of critical internet infrastructure recently completed a comprehensive evaluation of commercial DDI platforms. The engagement began as a paid proof‑of‑concept focused on whether an enterprise‑grade DDI solution could meet stringent requirements for availability, scale and operational simplicity. Over time, that assessment evolved into a strategic platform decision.

The customer ultimately chose Infoblox to replace a large, internally built BIND deployment and establish a standardized DNS foundation across multiple data centers, with a clear path to expand and layer on additional capabilities such as security services. Infoblox differentiated itself by:

Demonstrating resilient, highly available DNS at scale with richer features and easier day‑to‑day management than the in‑house solution or alternative vendors could provide

Showing that DNS could be delivered as a reliable, service‑oriented platform, rather than a collection of manually maintained servers and configurations

Equally important, Infoblox successfully navigated the customer’s rigorous vendor qualification process, including extended review of service terms, detailed security posture assessments and strict supplier requirements.

Being selected by yet another industry leader illustrates how Universal DDI and NIOS can address both the technical and governance expectations of highly regulated, risk‑sensitive organizations.

To dive deeper into this quarter’s innovations:

Review the November announcement: Building More Resilient, AI-Ready Networks with Infoblox Universal DDI™ and related materials.
