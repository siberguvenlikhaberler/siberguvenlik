Anthropic on Friday hit back after U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth directed the Pentagon to designate the artificial intelligence (AI) upstart as a "supply chain risk."

"This action follows months of negotiations that reached an impasse over two exceptions we requested to the lawful use of our AI model, Claude: the mass domestic surveillance of Americans and fully autonomous weapons," the company said.

"No amount of intimidation or punishment from the Department of War will change our position on mass domestic surveillance or fully autonomous weapons."

In a social media post on Truth Social, U.S. President Donald Trump said he was ordering all federal agencies to phase out the use of Anthropic technology within the next six months. A subsequent X post from Hegseth mandated that all contractors, suppliers, and partners doing business with the U.S. military cease any "commercial activity with Anthropic" effective immediately.

"In conjunction with the President's directive for the Federal Government to cease all use of Anthropic's technology, I am directing the Department of War to designate Anthropic a Supply Chain Risk to National Security," Hegseth wrote.

The designation comes after weeks of negotiations between the Pentagon and Anthropic over the use of its AI models by the U.S. military. In a post published this week, the company argued that its contracts should not facilitate mass domestic surveillance or the development of autonomous weapons.

"We support the use of AI for lawful foreign intelligence and counterintelligence missions," Anthropic noted. "But using these systems for mass domestic surveillance is incompatible with democratic values. AI-driven mass surveillance presents serious, novel risks to our fundamental liberties."

The company also called out the U.S. Department of War's (DoW) position that it will only work with AI companies that allow "any lawful use" of the technology, while removing any safeguards that may exist, as part of efforts to build an "AI-first" warfighting force and bolster national security.

"Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion and social ideology have no place in the DoW, so we must not employ AI models which incorporate ideological 'tuning' that interferes with their ability to provide objectively truthful responses to user prompts," a memorandum issued by the Pentagon last month reads.

"The Department must also utilize models free from usage policy constraints that may limit lawful military applications."

Responding to the designation, Anthropic described it as "legally unsound" and said it would set a dangerous precedent for any American company that negotiates with the government. It also noted that a supply chain risk designation under 10 USC 3252 can only extend to the use of Claude as part of DoW contracts, and that it cannot affect the use of Claude to serve other customers.

Hundreds of employees at Google and OpenAI have signed an open letter urging their companies to stand with Anthropic in its clash with the Pentagon over military applications for AI tools like Claude.

The standoff between Anthropic and the U.S. government comes as OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said OpenAI reached an agreement with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) to deploy its models in their classified network. It also asked DoD to extend those terms to all AI companies.

"AI safety and wide distribution of benefits are the core of our mission. Two of our most important safety principles are prohibitions on domestic mass surveillance and human responsibility for the use of force, including for autonomous weapon systems," Altman said in a post on X. "The DoW agrees with these principles, reflects them in law and policy, and we put them into our agreement."

[TAM METİN - 344 kelime]
The U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) this week announced the seizure of $61 million worth of Tether that were allegedly associated with bogus cryptocurrency schemes known as pig butchering.

The confiscated funds were traced to cryptocurrency addresses used for the laundering of criminally derived proceeds stolen from victims of cryptocurrency investment scams, the department added.

"Criminal actors and professional money launderers use cyber-enabled fraud schemes to swindle their victims and conceal their ill-gotten gains," said HSI Charlotte Acting Special Agent in Charge Kyle D. Burns.

"HSI special agents work diligently to trace the illicit proceeds of crime across the globe to disrupt and dismantle the transnational criminal organizations that seek to defraud hardworking Americans."

As is the norm in such cybercrime operations, threat actors are known to target individuals by cultivating romantic relationships after approaching them on dating and social media messaging apps. These activities are carried out by individuals who are trafficked into scam compounds operating primarily in Southeast Asia with promises of high-paying jobs.

The cybercrime syndicates behind the scams then confiscate their passports and are coerced into conning victims online by posing as charming strangers or brokers on investment platforms, or face brutal consequences. The end goal is to coax unsuspecting users into parting with their hard-earned money in fraudulent cryptocurrency investment schemes.

According to the DoJ, the fake platforms displayed made-up investment portfolios displaying unusually high returns in a deliberate attempt to make victims invest more of their funds. The reality hits when users try to withdraw their funds, at which point they are asked to pay an extra fee as a way to extract even more money from them.

"Once the victims' money transferred to a cryptocurrency wallet under the scammers’ control, the crooks quickly routed that money through many other wallets to hide the nature, source, control, and ownership of that stolen money," the department added.

In a coordinated announcement, Tether said it has frozen around $4.2 billion in assets linked to illicit activity to date, including nearly $250 million related to scam networks since June 2025 alone.

[3] The Hacker News - 900+ Sangoma FreePBX Instances Compromised in Ongoing Web Shell Attacks
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[TAM METİN - 317 kelime]
The Shadowserver Foundation has revealed that over 900 Sangoma FreePBX instances still remain infected with web shells as part of attacks that exploited a command injection vulnerability starting in December 2025.

Of these, 401 instances are located in the U.S., followed by 51 in Brazil, 43 in Canada, 40 in Germany, and 36 in France.

The non-profit entity said the compromises are likely accomplished via the exploitation of CVE-2025-64328 (CVSS score: 8.6), a high-severity security flaw that could enable post-authentication command injection.

"The impact is that any user with access to the FreePBX Administration panel could leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary shell commands on the underlying host," FreePBX said in an advisory for the flaw in November 2025. "An attacker could leverage this to obtain remote access to the system as the asterisk user."

The vulnerability affects FreePBX versions higher than and including 17.0.2.36. It was resolved in version 17.0.3. As mitigations, it's advised to add security controls to ensure that only authorized users have access to the FreePBX Administrator Control Panel (ACP), restrict access from hostile networks to the ACP, and update the filestore module to the latest version.

The vulnerability has since come under active exploitation in the wild, prompting the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to add it to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog earlier this month.

In a report published late last month, Fortinet FortiGuard Labs revealed that the threat actor behind the cyber fraud operation codenamed INJ3CTOR3 has been exploiting CVE-2025-64328 starting early December 2025 to deliver a web shell codenamed EncystPHP.

"By leveraging Elastix and FreePBX administrative contexts, the web shell operates with elevated privileges, enabling arbitrary command execution on the compromised host and initiating outbound call activity through the PBX environment," the cybersecurity company noted.

FreePBX users are recommended to update their FreePBX deployments to the latest version as soon as possible to counter active threats.

[4] The Hacker News - Malicious Go Crypto Module Steals Passwords, Deploys Rekoobe Backdoor
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[TAM METİN - 399 kelime]
Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed details of a malicious Go module that's designed to harvest passwords, create persistent access via SSH, and deliver a Linux backdoor named Rekoobe.

The Go module, github[.]com/xinfeisoft/crypto, impersonates the legitimate "golang.org/x/crypto" codebase, but injects malicious code that's responsible for exfiltrating secrets entered via terminal password prompts to a remote endpoint, fetches a shell script in response, and executes it.

"This activity fits namespace confusion and impersonation of the legitimate golang.org/x/crypto subrepository (and its GitHub mirror github.com/golang/crypto)," Socket security researcher Kirill Boychenko said. "The legitimate project identifies go.googlesource.com/crypto as canonical and treats GitHub as a mirror, a distinction the threat actor abuses to make github.com/xinfeisoft/crypto look routine in dependency graphs."

Specifically, the backdoor has been placed within the "ssh/terminal/terminal.go" file, so that every time a victim application invokes ReadPassword() – a function supposedly meant to read input like passwords from a terminal – it causes those interactive secrets to be captured.

The main responsibility of the downloaded script is to function as a Linux stager, appending a threat actor's SSH key to the "/home/ubuntu/.ssh/authorized_keys" file, set iptables default policies to ACCEPT in an attempt to loosen firewall restrictions, and retrieve additional payloads from an external server while disguising them with the .mp5 extension.

Of the two payloads, one is a helper that tests internet connectivity and attempts to communicate with an IP address ("154.84.63[.]184") over TCP port 443. The program likely functions as a recon or loader, Socket noted.

The second downloaded payload has been assessed to be Rekoobe, a known Linux trojan that has been detected in the wild since at least 2015. The backdoor is capable of receiving commands from an attacker-controlled server to download more payloads, steal files, and execute a reverse shell. As recently as August 2023, Rekoobe has been put to use by Chinese nation-state groups like APT31.

While the package still remains listed on pkg.go.dev, the Go security team has taken steps to block the library as malicious.

"This campaign will likely repeat because the pattern is low-effort and high-impact: a lookalike module that hooks a high-value boundary (ReadPassword), uses GitHub Raw as a rotating pointer, then pivots into curl | sh staging and Linux payload delivery," Boychenko said.

"Defenders should anticipate similar supply chain attacks targeting other 'credential edge' libraries (SSH helpers, CLI auth prompts, database connectors) and more indirection through hosting surfaces to rotate infrastructure without republishing code."

[5] The Hacker News - ScarCruft Uses Zoho WorkDrive and USB Malware to Breach Air-Gapped Networks
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Fri, 27 Feb 2026 18:13:00 +0530
Link: https://thehackernews.com/2026/02/scarcruft-uses-zoho-workdrive-and-usb.html

[TAM METİN - 658 kelime]
The North Korean threat actor known as ScarCruft has been attributed to a fresh set of tools, including a backdoor that uses Zoho WorkDrive for command-and-control (C2) communications to fetch more payloads and an implant that uses removable media to relay commands and breach air-gapped networks.

The campaign, codenamed Ruby Jumper by Zscaler ThreatLabz, involves the deployment of malware families, such as RESTLEAF, SNAKEDROPPER, THUMBSBD, VIRUSTASK, FOOTWINE, and BLUELIGHT to facilitate surveillance on a victim's system. It was discovered by the cybersecurity company in December 2025.

"In the Ruby Jumper campaign, when a victim opens a malicious LNK file, it launches a PowerShell command and scans the current directory to locate itself based on file size," security researcher Seongsu Park said. "Then, the PowerShell script launched by the LNK file carves multiple embedded payloads from fixed offsets within that LNK, including a decoy document, an executable payload, an additional PowerShell script, and a batch file."

One of the lure documents used in the campaign displays an article about the Palestine-Israel conflict that's translated from a North Korean newspaper into Arabic.

All three remaining payloads are used to progressively move the attack to the next stage, with the batch script launching PowerShell, which, in turn, is responsible for loading shellcode containing the payload after decrypting it. The Windows executable payload, named RESTLEAF, is spawned in memory, and uses Zoho WorkDrive for C2, marking the first time the threat actor has abused the cloud storage service in its attack campaigns.

Once it's successfully authenticated with the Zoho WorkDrive infrastructure by means of a valid access token, RESTLEAF downloads shellcode, which is then executed via process injection, eventually leading to the deployment of SNAKEDROPPER, which installs the Ruby runtime, sets up persistence using a scheduled task, and drops THUMBSBD and VIRUSTASK.

THUMBSBD, which is disguised as a Ruby file and uses removable media to relay commands and transfer data between internet-connected and air-gapped systems. It's capable of harvesting system information, downloading a secondary payload from a remote server, exfiltrating files, and executing arbitrary commands. If the presence of any removable media is detected, the malware creates a hidden folder and uses it to stage operator-issued commands or store execution output.

One of the payloads delivered by THUMBSBD is FOOTWINE, an encrypted payload with an integrated shellcode launcher that comes fitted with keylogging and audio and video capturing capabilities to conduct surveillance. It communicates with a C2 server using a custom binary protocol over TCP. The complete set of commands supported by the malware is as follows -

sm, for interactive command shell

fm, for file and directory manipulation

gm, for managing plugins and configuration

rm, for modifying the Windows Registry

pm, for enumerating running processes

dm, for taking screenshots and captures keystrokes

cm, for performing audio and video surveillance

s_d, for receiving batch script contents from C2 server, saving it to the file %TEMP%\SSMMHH_DDMMYYYY.bat, and executing it

pxm, for setting up a proxy connection and relaying traffic bidirectionally.

[filepath], for loading a given DLL

THUMBSBD is also designed to distribute BLUELIGHT, a backdoor previously attributed to ScarCruft since at least 2021. The malware weaponizes legitimate cloud providers, including Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive, pCloud, and BackBlaze, for C2 to run arbitrary commands, enumerate the file system, download additional payloads, upload files, and remove itself.

Also delivered as a Ruby file, VIRUSTASK functions similar to THUMBSBD in that it acts as a removable media propagation component to spread the malware to non-infected air-gapped systems. "Unlike THUMBSBD which handles command execution and exfiltration, VIRUSTASK focuses exclusively on weaponizing removable media to achieve initial access on air-gapped systems," Park explained.

"The Ruby Jumper campaign involves a mult-stage infection chain that begins with a malicious LNK file and utilizes legitimate cloud services (like Zoho WorkDrive, Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive, etc.) to deploy a novel, self-contained Ruby execution environment," Park said. "Most critically, THUMBSBD and VIRUSTASK weaponize removable media to bypass network isolation and infect air-gapped systems."

[6] The Hacker News - Trojanized Gaming Tools Spread Java-Based RAT via Browser and Chat Platforms
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[TAM METİN - 471 kelime]
Threat actors are luring unsuspecting users into running trojanized gaming utilities that are distributed via browsers and chat platforms to distribute a remote access trojan (RAT).

"A malicious downloader staged a portable Java runtime and executed a malicious Java archive (JAR) file named jd-gui.jar," the Microsoft Threat Intelligence team said in a post on X. "This downloader used PowerShell and living-off-the-land binaries (LOLBins) like cmstp.exe for stealthy execution."

The attack chain is also designed to evade detection by deleting the initial downloader and by configuring Microsoft Defender exclusions for the RAT components.

Persistence is achieved by means of a scheduled task and Windows startup script named "world.vbs," before the final payload is deployed on the compromised host. The malware, per Microsoft, is a "multi-purpose malware" that acts as a loader, runner, downloader, and RAT.

Once launched, it connects to an external server at "79.110.49[.]15" for command-and-control (C2) communications, allowing it to exfiltrate data and deploy additional payloads.

As ways to defend against the threat, users are advised to audit Microsoft Defender exclusions and scheduled tasks, remove malicious tasks and startup scripts, isolate affected endpoints, and reset credentials for users active on compromised hosts.

The disclosure comes as BlackFog disclosed details of a new Windows RAT malware family called Steaelite that was first advertised on criminal forums in November 2025 as a "best Windows RAT" with "fully undetectable" (FUD) capabilities. It's compatible with both Windows 10 and 11.

Unlike other off-the-shelf RATs sold to criminal actors, Steaelite bundles together data theft and ransomware, packaging them into one web panel, with an Android ransomware module on the way. The panel also incorporates various developer tools to facilitate keylogging, client-to-victim chat, file searching, USB spreading, wallpaper modification, UAC bypass, and clipper functionality.

Other notable features include removing competing malware, disabling Microsoft Defender, or configuring exclusions, and installing persistence methods.

As for its main capabilities, Steaelite RAT supports remote code execution, file management, live streaming, webcam and microphone access, process management, clipboard monitoring, password theft, installed program enumeration, location tracking, arbitrary file execution, URL opening, DDoS attacks, and VB.NET payload compilation.

"The tool gives operators browser-based control over infected Windows machines, covering remote code execution, credential theft, live surveillance, file exfiltration, and ransomware deployment from a single dashboard," security researcher Wendy McCague said.

"A single threat actor can browse files, exfiltrate documents, harvest credentials, and deploy ransomware from the same dashboard. This enables complete double extortion from one tool."

In recent weeks, threat hunters have also discovered two new RAT families tracked as DesckVB RAT and KazakRAT that enable comprehensive remote control over infected hosts and even selectively deploy capabilities post-compromise. According to Ctrl Alt Intel, KazakRAT is suspected to be the work of a suspected state-affiliated cluster targeting Kazakh and Afghan entities as part of a persistent campaign ongoing since at least August 2022.

[7] The Hacker News - Meta Files Lawsuits Against Brazil, China, Vietnam Advertisers Over Celeb-Bait Scams
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Fri, 27 Feb 2026 13:26:00 +0530

[TAM METİN - 1123 kelime]
Meta on Thursday said it's taking legal action to tackle scams on its platforms by filing lawsuits against what it calls deceptive advertisers based in Brazil, China, and Vietnam.

As part of the effort, the advertisers' methods of payment have been suspended, related accounts have been disabled, and the website domain names used to pull off the scams have been blocked.

Concurrently, the social media giant said it has also issued cease and desist letters to eight marketing consultants who advertised the ability to bypass its ad policy enforcement systems. This included fake "un-ban" or account restoration services and renting access to trusted accounts so as to help clients bypass its controls.

At least three advertisers, two from Brazil and one from China, were found to engage in celeb-bait scams, which often involve misusing the image of well-known figures to trick people into clicking on bogus ads that lead to scam sites. These websites are designed to harvest sensitive data or dupe unsuspecting users into sending money or investing in fake platforms.

The three advertisers against whom Meta has filed lawsuits are listed below -

Brazil-based Vitor Lourenço de Souza and Milena Luciani Sanchez are being sued for using altered images and voices of celebrities to promote fraudulent healthcare products.

Brazil-based B&B Suplementos e Cosméticos Ltda. (Brites Corp), Brites Academia de Treinamento Ltda., Daniel de Brites Macieira Cordeiro, and José Victor de Brites Chaves de Araújo for being part of a scam operation that leveraged synthetic imagery of a prominent physician to advertise healthcare products without regulatory approval and sold courses teaching the same tactics.

China-based Shenzhen Yunzheng Technology Co., Ltd for using celeb-bait ads to target people in various countries, including the U.S. and Japan, as part of a fraud scheme designed to lure them into joining investment groups.

"To fight celeb-bait scams, we developed protections for celebrities whose images are repeatedly used in these schemes," Meta said. "This program currently protects the images of more than 500,000 celebrities and public figures around the world."

In addition, the company noted that it sued Vietnam-based advertiser Lý Văn Lâm for using cloaking techniques to get around its review process. Cloaking refers to an adversarial technique that aims to conceal the true nature of a website linked to an ad in an attempt to fool ad review systems by serving one version of its content during the review and showing an entirely different and malicious content to real users.

In this case, the advertiser is said to have used scam ads to offer discounted items from well-known brands in exchange for completing a survey. People who interacted with these ads were taken to phony websites where they were asked to enter credit card information to purchase items that were never delivered. Their credit cards also incurred unauthorized, recurring fees, a practice known as subscription fraud.

The development comes months after a Reuters investigation found that 19% of Meta's $18 billion in ad sales in China in 2024 came from ads for scams, illegal gambling, pornography, and other banned content. The report also uncovered agencies that allow businesses to run banned advertisements, prompting the company to put its Badged Partners program under review.

In an analysis of 14.5 million ads running on Meta platforms across the E.U. and U.K. over a 23-day period, Gen Digital found that nearly one in three of those ads (about 30.99%) pointed to a scam, phishing, or malware link.

"In total, scam ads generated more than 300 million impressions in less than a month," the cybersecurity company said earlier this month. "The activity was highly concentrated, with just 10 advertisers responsible for over 56% of all observed scam ads. Repeated campaign clusters were traced to shared payment and infrastructure linked to China and Hong Kong, indicating organized, industrial-scale operations rather than isolated bad actors."

These findings also coincide with the discovery of malicious infrastructure and underground services that have been used to peddle various kinds of scams -

Scams have been found to combine malvertising and pig butchering fraud models to defraud victims, primarily those in Japan, by tricking them into clicking on investment-themed ads on social media. These ads redirect victims to websites that prompt them to engage with a supposed expert via messaging apps by scanning a QR code.

Once victims are added to one-on-one and group chats with these so-called experts, who are nothing but artificial intelligence (AI)-powered chatbots in some cases, they are persuaded to invest progressively larger amounts of money, only to demand a "release fee" to unlock non-existent profits. More than 23,000 domains within this ecosystem have been discovered.

Threat actors are compromising routers to alter DNS settings to use shadow resolvers hosted in Aeza International, a bulletproof hosting company (BPH) sanctioned by the U.S. Government in July 2025. This unauthorized modification is engineered to selectively alter DNS responses associated with Okta and Shopify, allowing the operators to direct users to scam and malware content by means of an HTTP-based traffic distribution system (TDS).

A malicious push notification network has been observed using a network of malicious domains to target Android Chrome users all over the world with a steady stream of unwanted push notifications (e.g., "Android infected with malware!" or "System needs a scan") after obtaining permissions in a bid to direct to scam sites and adult content. According to data from Infoblox, Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, and Pakistan represented 50% of all the traffic.

A network of over 150 cloned, fake websites has been identified impersonating real law firms based in the U.S. and the U.K., and targeting users looking for legal advice and representation to promote a business impersonation scam.

"The sites used the firm's name, branding, and publicly available attorney identities, presenting themselves as legitimate legal and asset-recovery services, offering to help victims recover funds lost to prior fraud," Sygnia said. "The campaign targeted individuals who had already suffered financial fraud."

The proliferation of scams, fueled by a booming pig butchering‑as‑a‑service (PBaaS) economy, has not escaped law enforcement's attention, as evidenced by the dismantling of scam compounds in Southeast Asia in recent months.

Earlier this month, the Cambodian government promised to crack down and dismantle cyber scam networks operating within its borders, adding that police officials launched 48 operations in the first nine months of 2025 to combat cyber fraud, arrested 168 people, and deported 2,722 people back to their home countries.

The ongoing efforts have cut scam activity in half since the start of this year, Senior Minister Chhay Sinarith, chairman of the Secretariat of the Commission for Combating Technology Crimes, was quoted as saying this week. Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet also acknowledged that online scam centres operating in the country are damaging its reputation and undermining its economy.

[TAM METİN - 405 kelime]
Microsoft is rolling out new Windows 11 Insider Preview builds that improve security and performance during batch file or CMD script execution.

As Microsoft explained today, IT administrators can now enable a more secure processing mode that prevents batch files from being modified while they run by adding the LockBatchFilesInUse registry value under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor.

Policy authors can also enable this mode using the LockBatchFilesWhenInUse application manifest control.

This change is designed to boost performance and security in enterprise environments where admins rely heavily on scripted workflows.

"We are giving administrators and Application Control for Business policy authors additional controls over the processing of batch files and CMD scripts. Starting with this release, administrators may enable a more secure mode for processing batch files that ensures they do not change during execution," the Windows Insider team said.

"This enhances the performance and security of batch file processing when code integrity is enabled, as signature validation will only be required to be performed a single time, instead of per statement executed in the batch file."

With today's Windows Insider builds, Microsoft has also improved the Shared audio feature, introduced in October, which allows sharing audio between two headphones, speakers, earbuds, or hearing aids.

Previously, volume adjustments affected both users equally, but the new update adds individual volume sliders for each listener and device. A new taskbar indicator also appears during active sharing sessions to provide a visual reminder and a one-click shortcut to sharing settings.

The compatible device lineup has also expanded to include more Bluetooth LE Audio accessories, with the Samsung Galaxy Buds 4 and Buds 4 Pro, Sony WF-1000XM6, and Xbox Wireless Headset now also supporting the feature.

These new capabilities are rolling out to Windows Insiders in the Beta and Dev channels who have installed Windows 11 Preview Build 26220.7934 (KB5077242) and Windows 11 Preview Build 26300.7939 (KB5077243), respectively.

[9] BleepingComputer - APT37 hackers use new malware to breach air-gapped networks
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Fri, 27 Feb 2026 14:21:25 -0500

[TAM METİN - 697 kelime]
North Korean hackers are deploying newly uncovered tools to move data between internet-connected and air-gapped systems, spread via removable drives, and conduct covert surveillance.

The malicious campaign has been named Ruby Jumper and is attributed to the state-backed group APT37, also known as ScarCruft, Ricochet Chollima, and InkySquid.

Air-gapped computers are disconnected from external networks, especially the public internet. Physical isolation is achieved at the hardware level by removing all connectivity (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Ethernet), while logical segregation relies on various software-defined controls, like VLANs and firewalls.

In a physical air-gap environment, typical in critical infrastructure, military, and research sectors, data transfer is done through removable storage drives.

Researchers at cloud security company Zscaler analyzed the malware employed in APT37's Ruby Jumper campaign and identified a toolkit of five malicious tools: RESTLEAF, SNAKEDROPPER, THUMBSBD, VIRUSTASK, and FOOTWINE.

The infection chain begins when the victim opens a malicious Windows shortcut file (LNK), which deploys a PowerShell script that extracts payloads embedded in the LNK file. To divert attention, the script also launches a decoy document.

Although the researchers did not specify any victims, they note that the document is an Arabic translation of a North Korean newspaper article about the Palestine-Israel conflict.

The PowerShell script loads the first malware component, called RESTLEAF, an implant that communicates with APT37's command-and-control (C2) infrastructure using Zoho WorkDrive.

RESTLEAF fetches encrypted shellcode from the C2 to download the next-stage payload, a Ruby-based loader named SNAKEDROPPER.

The attack continues with installing the Ruby 3.3.0 runtime environment - complete with the interpreter, standard libraries, and gem infrastructure - disguised as a legitimate USB-related utility named usbspeed.exe.

"SNAKEDROPPER is primed for execution by replacing the RubyGems default file operating_system.rb with a maliciously modified version that is automatically loaded when the Ruby interpreter starts," via a scheduled task (rubyupdatecheck) that executes every five minutes, the researchers say.

The THUMBSBD backdoor is downloaded as a Ruby file named ascii.rb, as well as the VIRUSTASK malware as the bundler_index_client.rb file.

The role of THUMBSBD is to collect system information, stage command files, and prepare data for exfiltration. Its most crucial function is to create hidden directories on detected USB drives and copy files to them.

According to the researchers, the malware turns removable storage devices "into a bidirectional covert C2 relay." This allows the threat actor to deliver commands to air-gapped systems as well as extract data from them.

“By leveraging removable media as an intermediary transport layer, the malware bridges otherwise air-gapped network segments,” Zscaler researchers say.

VIRUSTASK's role is to spread the infection to new air-gapped machines, weaponizing removable drives by hiding legitimate files and replacing them with malicious shortcuts that execute the embedded Ruby interpreter when opened.

The module will only trigger an infection process if the inserted removable media has at least 2GB of free space.

Zscaler reports that THUMBSBD also delivers FOOTWINE, a Windows spyware backdoor disguised as an Android package file (APK) that supports keylogging, screenshot capture, audio and video recording, file manipulation, registry access, and remote shell commands.

Another piece of malware also observed in the APT37's RubyJumper campaign is BLUELIGHT, a full-fledged backdoor previously associated with the North Korean threat group.

Zscaler has high confidence attributing the RubyJumper campaign to APT37 based on several indicators, including the use of the BLUELIGHT malware, initial vector relying on LNK files, two-stage shellcode delivery technique, and C2 infrastructure typically observed in attacks from this actor.

The researchers also note that the decoy document indicates that the target of the RubyJumper activity is interested in North Korean media narratives, which aligns with the victim profile of this threat group.

[TAM METİN - 442 kelime]
A yearlong Europol-coordinated operation dubbed "Project Compass" has led to 30 arrests and 179 suspects being tied to "The Com," an online cybercrime collective that targets children and teenagers.

In a press release issued on Thursday, Europol said that investigators identified 62 victims and directly safeguarded four of them from the group's attacks.

Launched in January 2025 and led by Europol's European Counter Terrorism Centre, the Project Compass joint action has brought together law enforcement agencies from 28 countries to combat The Com (short for Community).

Described by Europol as a decentralized nihilistic extremist network, The Com is a loose-knit network of English-speaking cybercriminals known for targeting, victimizing, and recruiting young people for extortion, violence, and the production of child sexual exploitation material (CSAM).

The Com operates across a wide range of social media, online gaming environments, messaging apps, and music streaming platforms, and is organized into multiple subgroups, including:

Offline Com, which promotes property damage, harming others, and committing acts of terrorism,

Cyber Com, which orchestrates network intrusions and ransomware attacks,

(S)extortion Com, which coerces minors into sex crimes and encourages self-harm and suicide.

Another subgroup that first surfaced in 2021 and is known as "764" is especially notorious within The Com as it grooms young people into producing explicit content, which is then used for blackmail or shared among members.

Two alleged 764 leaders (21-year-old Leonidas Varagiannis and 20-year-old Prasan Nepal) were arrested in April 2025 and charged with operating an international child exploitation ring, and are now facing life in prison.

The Com has previously been linked to high-profile ransomware attacks against Marks & Spencer, Co-op, and Harrods in April 2025, as well as Las Vegas casino breaches in September 2023.

"These networks deliberately target children in the digital spaces where they feel most at ease," said Anna Sjöberg, the head of Europol's European Counter Terrorism Centre.

"Project Compass allows us to intervene earlier, safeguard victims and disrupt those who exploit vulnerability for extremist purposes. No country can address this threat alone - and through this cooperation, we are closing the gaps they try to hide in."

[11] BleepingComputer - CISA warns that RESURGE malware can be dormant on Ivanti devices
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Fri, 27 Feb 2026 10:57:04 -0500

[TAM METİN - 658 kelime]
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has released new details about RESURGE, a malicious implant used in zero-day attacks exploiting CVE-2025-0282 to breach Ivanti Connect Secure devices.

The update focuses on the implant's undetected latency on the appliances and its "sophisticated network-level evasion and authentication techniques" that enable covert communication with the attacker.

CISA originally documented the malware on March 28 last year, saying that it can survive reboots, create webshells for stealing credentials, create accounts, reset passwords, and escalate privileges.

According to researchers at incident response company Mandiant, the critical CVE-2025-0282 vulnerability was exploited as a zero-day since mid-December 2024 by a threat actor linked to China, tracked internally as UNC5221.

Network-level evasion

CISA's updated bulletin provides additional technical information on RESURGE, a malicious 32-bit Linux Shared Object file named libdsupgrade.so that was extracted from a compromised device.

The implant is described as a passive command-and-control (C2) implant with rootkit, bootkit, backdoor, dropper, proxying, and tunneling capabilities.

Instead of beaconing to the C2, it waits indefinitely for a particular inbound TLS connection, evading network monitoring, CISA says in the updated document.

When loaded under the ‘web’ process, it hooks the ‘accept()’ function to inspect incoming TLS packets before they reach the web server, looking for specific connection attempts from a remote attacker that are identified using the CRC32 TLS fingerprint hashing scheme.

If the fingerprint does not match, traffic is directed to the legitimate Ivanti server. CISA further details Rusrge's authentication mechanism saying that the threat actor also uses a fake Ivanti certificate to ensure that they are interacting with the implant and not the Ivanti web server.

The agency highlights that the certificate's purpose is just to for authentication and verification purposes, as it is not used to encrypt communication. Furthermore, the fake certificate also helps the actor evade detection by impersonating the legitimate server.

Because the forged certificate is sent unencrypted over the internet, CISA says that defenders could use it as a network signature to detect an active compromise.

After fingerprint validation and authentication with the malware, the threat actor establishes secure remote access to the implant using a Mutual TLS session encrypted with the Elliptic Curve protocol.

"Static analysis indicates the RESURGE implant will request the remote actors' EC key to utilize for encryption, and will also verify it with a hard-coded EC Certificate Authority (CA) key," CISA says.

By mimicking legitimate TLS/SSH traffic, the implant achieves stealth and persistence, the American cybersecurity agency says.

Another file analyzed is a variant of the SpawnSloth malware using the name liblogblock.so and contained by the RESURGE implant. Its main purpose is log tampering to hide malicious activity on compromised devices.

A third file that CISA analyzed is dsmain, a kernel extraction script that embeds the open-source script 'extract_vmlinux.sh' and the BusyBox collection of Unix/Linux utilities.

It allows RESURGE to decrypt, modify, and re-encrypt coreboot firmware images and manipulate filesystem contents for boot-level persistence.

“CISA’s updated analysis shows that RESURGE can remain latent on systems until a remote actor attempts to connect to the compromised device,” the agency notes. Because of this, the malicious implant "may be dormant and undetected on Ivanti Connect Secure devices and remains an active threat."

CISA suggests that system administrators use the updated indicators of compromise (IoCs) to discover dormant RESURGE infections and remove them from Ivanti devices.

[12] BleepingComputer - Third-Party Patching and the Business Footprint We All Share
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Fri, 27 Feb 2026 10:00:10 -0500
Link: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/third-party-patching-and-the-business-footprint-we-all-share/

[TAM METİN - 1702 kelime]
When security teams talk about attack surface, the conversation usually starts in familiar places. Servers, identity systems, VPN access, cloud workloads, maybe browsers. Those are visible. They show up in diagrams and asset inventories.

What gets less attention are the everyday tools people use to actually get work done.

PDF readers. Compression utilities. Remote access clients. Word processors. Spreadsheet tools. Email clients. Browsers. Screen sharing software. Update managers. The background software that quietly powers normal business activity.

Most organizations do not spend much time debating whether to deploy these. They are simply part of operating in a digital economy. Contracts arrive as PDFs. Finance works in spreadsheets. HR reviews resumes. IT supports users remotely. Executives live in email and browsers. These tools become part of the environment almost by default.

At Action1, where visibility into third-party software exposure across endpoints is a daily focus, these background tools consistently emerge as a defining part of the real-world attack surface.

That commonness is what makes them attractive targets from a threat actor’s perspective.

The value of being ordinary

From the outside, modern enterprises look different. Networks vary. Architectures change. Security stacks evolve. But, inside most environments, the same classes of applications appear again and again, and more often than not, the same software titles dominate the majority of installations.

It is difficult to function in modern business without an email client, document processing software, a browser, and tools for packaging, previewing, and sharing files. Using similar products is less about preference and more about compatibility.

Business depends on exchanging information in formats everyone else can use. Without those standards, we go back to the days of file-format wars, “I cannot open that, we use something else,” and lost time just trying to make data usable. That friction is why the industry standardized, and why the same major names still dominate.

Attackers pay attention to that.

Rather than predicting every custom application an organization might run, they look for overlap. If a vulnerability appears in a widely used PDF engine, spreadsheet parser, email preview component, or remote access utility, the chances it connects with something real are high. The exploit is aimed less at unique architecture and more at familiarity.

Most successful exploitation does not rely on exotic techniques. It relies on muscle memory. Users open PDFs, Word files, spreadsheets, and links all day long. Attackers are betting those actions feel routine enough that nobody hesitates.

That familiarity shapes how campaigns are built, and it should influence how defense strategies are planned.

“I love patching,” said no one ever.

Good thing Action1 does it for you, now on Linux too—alongside Windows, macOS, and third-party apps.

One platform. Zero infrastructure. Real-time visibility. Finally, patching that just works.

How probability shapes attacks

Many attacks historically looked like guesswork. An attacker might send a crafted email for Outlook, hoping the recipient uses Outlook. Or attach a weaponized spreadsheet, hoping Excel is present. Or send a malicious PDF, hoping the reader is vulnerable.

There is uncertainty in that approach. The exploit launches before the attacker truly knows what exists on the other end. This increases chances the attack will be detected before being effective, and it risks valuable exploit code to failure, where it may be detected, profiled, then henceforth scanned and detected.

What changes with common utilities is the probability curve.

Email clients, browsers, word processors, spreadsheets, PDF readers, and archive tools appear in most business environments because the work itself requires them. An attacker does not need perfect information to expect something compatible nearby.

Instead of treating exploitation as a one-off guess, attackers think in likelihood. They invest effort where overlap is largest. The more widespread the tool, the more attractive it becomes as an entry point.

That is why vulnerabilities in these utilities move quickly through exploit ecosystems. Once something works in a familiar toolchain, it scales. If one user relies on Outlook, Word, and Adobe, there is a good chance coworkers and business relations do as well for interoperability reasons.

The standard business footprint in practice

These tools also travel together.

If an email clearly originated from Outlook, it already hints at part of the environment. Email workflows connect to document workflows. If Outlook is present, Word and Excel are often nearby.

Each utility reinforces the presence of others.

For attackers, that enables paths rather than isolated exploits. An issue in an email client connects to attachment handling, preview engines, document renderers, shared libraries, and integrations that tend to coexist on the same system.

Instead of targeting a single application, the attack surface starts to resemble the business footprint itself, the collection of tools people rely on every day.

When vulnerabilities appear in that footprint, they attract more attention because they fit naturally into how people already work.

Quiet signals and small leaks

Another part of the story is information people do not realize they share.

Documents often contain metadata. PDFs reference the engine that produced them. Spreadsheets carry formatting behavior tied to specific suites. Email headers expose client details. Browser traffic advertises user agents. File structures reveal habits and versions.

A single attachment, email, or shared document can quietly describe parts of the software stack behind it.

In isolation it does not look sensitive. Often it is not even visible. Over time it builds a picture of what tools are common, what standards they follow, and how files are processed.

What created it, what version, how recently, so when old software details show in current workflows, the software processing it is old. And old software often means years of exploit potential bottled up in one package. That is often what turns speculation into precision.

Those breadcrumbs help attackers shape payloads that align with what exists on the other side, increasing effectiveness while reducing noisy experimentation.

Why third-party software drifts

Most enterprises put real effort into operating system patching. Update pipelines are understood. Browsers update often. Mobile devices follow management policies. Systems start with baselines and are monitored.

Third-party utilities live differently.

Vendors ship different installers. Some auto-update. Some rely on users. Some get disabled by packaging systems. Some stay frozen because workflows depend on a version.

Over time, multiple builds of the same tool spread across endpoints. Some become stale. Some live for years with known vulnerabilities simply because they fell off the radar.

In Action1’s analysis of enterprise environments, it is common to find multiple versions of the same third-party application coexisting, some lagging years behind current security fixes. This fragmentation quietly accumulates exploit potential without triggering obvious alerts.

From a security view, that drift matters because attackers do not need new exploits. They benefit from whatever version still exists somewhere in the footprint. A five-year-old PDF reader quietly carries five years of cumulative exploit potential.

What feels like small technical debt widens the opportunity window for major exploitation.

Trust and everyday behavior

There is also a human side to these tools.

Email, documents, browsers, and archives feel like infrastructure. People trust them like desks and keyboards. Opening a PDF does not feel like running code. Previewing an email does not feel like execution. Extracting a file feels routine.

By the time behavior looks unusual, the initial interaction already happened in a place people rarely question. These actions occur thousands of times a day, which makes tracing a compromise back to a document, email, or user extremely difficult.

Looking at the footprint, not just the platform

For leadership teams, the value here is perspective, not fear.

Security strategies often start with the platform layer, operating systems, networks, identity, cloud infrastructure. Those matter, but they do not tell the full story of how work actually happens.

Work happens in email clients, spreadsheets, PDFs, browsers, archive tools, and remote sessions. That is where files open, previews render, links get clicked, and data moves between people.

That makes them predictable.

That is why third-party patching often carries more risk weight than expected. The operating system may be tightly managed, while the tools on top quietly define real exposure.

Looking at the footprint is less about assuming weakness and more about understanding where everyday work intersects with real security concerns.

A quieter way to think about patching

Third-party patching often feels operational rather than strategic. Yet these utilities sit at the intersection of people, files, and execution.

They are ordinary, and that is exactly why they matter.

Not because every organization looks the same, but because they look similar enough that attackers design around that similarity.

When teams examine environments, the focus is usually infrastructure. There is also value in asking what the standard business suite looks like across endpoints, how it evolves, and how consistently it stays current.

Which tools are actually needed? Which are simply part of a default deploy? Which stay installed even when unused? Which stop getting updated because nobody notices them?

This is why, in practice, teams working with platforms like Action1 consistently see third-party patching deliver a greater reduction in real-world risk than many more visible security controls. Exploitation rarely hinges on a single overlooked vulnerability. It is enabled by years of accumulated drift across third-party applications that quietly fall out of date while remaining embedded in everyday workflows.

Those conditions exist long before an exploit is written or deployed. They shape the practical attack surface by defining which software actually executes, which files get opened, and which actions feel routine enough to avoid scrutiny.

Third-party software is not adjacent to the platform — it is part of how the platform operates, and it is often where exposure concentrates when everything else appears well-managed.

Action1is a founder-led company, brought to you by the original minds behind Netwrix. At the time of this writing, it is one of the fastest-growing private software companies in the US because organizations are recognizing that OS and third-party patching can no longer be treated as a secondary task.

Addressing modern risk requires continuous visibility into third-party software and the ability to remediate vulnerable applications across endpoints quickly and consistently. When teams evaluate modern patch management solutions, Action1 increasingly represents the option designed around that reality.

[13] BleepingComputer - Ukrainian man pleads guilty to running AI-powered fake ID site

[TAM METİN - 470 kelime]
A Ukrainian man has pleaded guilty to operating OnlyFake, an AI-powered website that generated and sold more than 10,000 photos of fake identification documents to customers worldwide.

27-year-old Yurii Nazarenko (also known as "John Wick," "Tor Ford," and "Uriel Septimberus") admitted that his OnlyFake subscription-based platform used artificial intelligence to generate realistic-looking counterfeit passports, driver's licenses, and Social Security cards.

"We rely on government issued IDs to combat terrorism, hijackings, fraud, money laundering, and a host of other crimes," said U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton on Thursday. "OnlyFake’s manufacture of fraudulent IDs and other documents puts us all at risk and must be stopped."

According to the indictment, Nazarenko's OnlyFake platform allowed customers to generate fake digital versions of U.S. driver's licenses for all 50 states and U.S. passports and passport cards, as well as digital versions of identification documents for roughly 56 other countries.

Customers could also customize the fake digital documents with personal details, opt for randomized information, and choose whether the finished product appeared as a scan or a tabletop photograph.

New York federal prosecutors said that the primary use of these fake digital documents was to circumvent Know Your Customer (KYC) verification requirements at banks and cryptocurrency exchanges, which are safeguards designed to prevent money laundering mandated under the Patriot Act.

Undercover FBI agents made multiple purchases from the OnlyFake website between May and June 2024, obtaining fake New York state IDs, U.S. passports, and a Social Security card.

OnlyFake only accepted cryptocurrency payments, and also offered bulk packages of up to 1,000 fake documents at a discount. Nazarenko further attempted to cover his tracks by routing cryptocurrency payments through multiple wallets and deleting emails after 404 Media reported on the site in February 2024.

"Yurii Nazarenko developed a website to produce more than 10,000 fake identification documents, earning hundreds of thousands of dollars from these illicit sales," added FBI Assistant Director in Charge James C. Barnacle, Jr. "This platform offered its clients a myriad of criminal opportunities, including bypassing traditional regulations to launder money."

Nazarenko was extradited from Romania in September 2025 and has agreed to forfeit $1.2 million. He is now facing a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison and is scheduled for sentencing on June 26, 2026.

[14] Security Affairs - Aeternum botnet hides commands in Polygon smart contracts

[TAM METİN - 608 kelime]
Aeternum botnet hides commands in Polygon smart contracts

Aeternum botnet uses Polygon blockchain smart contracts for C&C, making its infrastructure harder to detect and disrupt.

Qrator Labs researchers uncovered Aeternum, a botnet that runs its command-and-control infrastructure through smart contracts on the Polygon blockchain. By decentralizing its C2, the malware avoids traditional server-based takedowns and becomes far harder to disrupt or shut down, significantly increasing its resilience and persistence in the wild.

“Instead of relying on traditional servers or domains for command and control, Aeternum stores its instructions on the public Polygon blockchain. This network is widely used by decentralized applications, including Polymarket, the world’s largest prediction market.” reads the report published by Qrator Labs. “This approach makes Aeternum’s C2 infrastructure effectively permanent and resistant to traditional takedown methods.”

Aeternum is a C++ botnet loader offered in both 32- and 64-bit versions that uses the Polygon blockchain as its command-and-control backbone. Operators write commands into smart contracts on Polygon. Infected machines poll public RPC endpoints, read the on-chain instructions, and execute them.

Using a web dashboard, operators pick a smart contract, choose what action to send, add a payload URL, and then send the command as a blockchain transaction. Once confirmed, the instruction becomes immutable and accessible to all infected hosts, typically within minutes.

Operators can manage multiple contracts at once, each tied to different payloads like stealers, clippers, RATs, or miners. A ping feature also allows tracking of active infections and precise targeting using hardware IDs and HTTP fingerprinting.

Blockchain-based C2 changes the botnet takedown playbook. Traditional botnets rely on domains, IPs, or servers that defenders can seize, suspend, or sinkhole. Aeternum avoids those weak points by storing commands on the Polygon blockchain, replicated across thousands of nodes and reachable via many RPC endpoints. There is no central server to shut down. Past cases like Glupteba showed blockchain as a backup channel; Aeternum makes it the primary one, removing traditional disruption options.

Aeternum is sold either as a lifetime package with a ready-to-use panel or as full C++ source code with updates. Operating costs remain minimal: about $1 in MATIC can fund over 100 blockchain command transactions, with no need for servers or domains, just a crypto wallet and the control panel.

The malware also includes anti-VM checks to evade sandbox analysis and a built-in AV scanner to test detection rates before deployment, lowering barriers for running a resilient, stealthy botnet.

“The seller bundles a scantime AV scanner powered by the Kleenscan API, allowing operators to check their builds against 37 antivirus engines before deployment.” continues the report. “The results shown in the seller’s screenshots indicate only 12 out of 37 engines flagging the sample, with major vendors including CrowdStrike, Avast, Avira, and ClamAV all returning “undetected.” These results represent a point-in-time snapshot and detection rates will change as vendors update their signatures.”

Even if Aeternum itself doesn’t gain mass adoption, blockchain-based C2 is now a ready-made underground product. The model is effective and likely to be reused and refined by other malware developers. Botnets built this way could last longer, grow larger, and power large-scale attacks such as DDoS, credential stuffing, click fraud, and proxy services.

“Traditional upstream takedowns become harder when the C2 channel is immutable, and even if the botnet malware is removed from every infected machine, the operator can redeploy using the same smart contracts without rebuilding anything.” concludes the report. “This makes proactive DDoS mitigation more important than ever: if such botnets can’t be taken down at the source, defenders must focus on filtering malicious traffic at the edge.”

Juniper issues emergency patch for critical PTX router RCE

Juniper released an emergency patch for Junos OS Evolved to fix CVE-2026-21902, a critical RCE flaw affecting PTX routers.

Juniper Networks issued an out-of-band security update for Junos OS Evolved to address a critical remote code execution vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2026-21902 (CVSS score of 9.3), impacting PTX routers.

The company urges customers to apply the patch promptly to protect network infrastructure from potential exploitation.

The flaw resides in the On-Box Anomaly Detection framework of Junos OS Evolved on PTX Series routers and lets unauthenticated remote attackers execute code as root. The service, enabled by default, should be restricted to internal processes but can be accessed externally due to incorrect permissions, allowing full device takeover.

“An Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource vulnerability in the On-Box Anomaly detection framework of Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved on PTX Series allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to execute code as root.

The On-Box Anomaly detection framework should only be reachable by other internal processes over the internal routing instance, but not over an externally exposed port.” reads the advisory published by the vendor. “With the ability to access and manipulate the service to execute code as root a remote attacker can take complete control of the device. Please note that this service is enabled by default as no specific configuration is required.”

The vulnerability affects versions before 25.4R1-S1-EVO and 25.4R2-EVO, but not earlier releases or standard Junos OS. Juniper found the flaw internally and reports no active exploitation.

The vendor recommends limiting access to the vulnerable service using ACLs or firewall filters to allow only trusted hosts, or disabling the service entirely with request pfe anomalies disable as a workaround.

The company discovered the vulnerability during internal product security testing or research. Juniper SIRT is not aware of any attacks in the wild exploiting this flaw.

How AI Aids Incident Response: Why Humans Alone Cannot Do IR Efficiently

AI accelerates incident response by correlating alerts and generating reports in minutes, helping teams scale beyond manual limits.

Incident response has always been a race against the clock. It starts ticking the moment an alert is triggered, and each minute thereafter can lead to lost revenue, regulatory exposure, reputational damage, or customer churn.

Traditionally, incident response has relied on highly skilled analysts manually switching between tools, correlating logs, validating alerts, escalating findings, and drafting executive reports. It’s meticulous work, which is expensive and slow.

Not by replacing humans, but by removing the friction that makes human-led investigation inefficient in the first place.

The Time and Cost of Traditional Incident Response

According to Prophet Security, a leading provider of AI SOC solutions, a typical security investigation can take around 10-20 minutes, depending on severity. Complex incidents (particularly those involving cloud, SaaS, and hybrid infrastructure) can take many days.

Analysts have to manually query SIEM platforms, pull endpoint telemetry, check threat intelligence feeds, and correlate identity logs. They also have to validate suspicious behavior, and draft reports for management. They do all of this again and again.

People get tired. They context-switch. They miss correlations buried in millions of log entries. They operate within limited working hours. AI does not.

An AI-enabled incident response capability can begin investigating the moment an alert is generated.

It can immediately pull contextual data from multiple tools, cross-reference threat intelligence feeds, analyze behavioral patterns, compare activity to historical baselines, assign risk ratings, and produce formatted summaries for stakeholders. What might take an analyst many hours to complete, can be delivered in minutes with an AI-enabled tool. This can often be due to complicated integrations with other tools used in the network, but with the use of those tools, the time to discovery can be decreased significantly.

That speed improves efficiency and changes the entire operating model of a SOC.

What Most Teams Don’t Realize About AI Investigation

Here’s something many security leaders underestimate: An AI investigation can aggregate and correlate data across systems faster than any team of people because it operates across tools simultaneously.

Instead of manually pivoting from your SIEM to your EDR to your identity provider to your cloud logs, AI can ingest and analyze them in parallel. It can pull data from a host of sources, such as endpoint telemetry, identity and access logs, network flow data, cloud workload logs, email security alerts, and threat intelligence feeds.

Within seconds, it can identify relationships that would take a human hours to uncover, and it does so consistently.

There are no skipped steps, fatigue, or variation in the process.

Faster Answers for the People Who Matter

Security teams don’t just investigate incidents, they answer questions, from CISOs, the board, customers, watchdogs, and the press.

“What is the business impact?”

“What’s our exposure?”

In a traditional model, generating a structured executive summary can take almost as long as the technical investigation itself. With AI, this all changes.

Modern AI-driven incident response platforms can generate structured executive reports, technical deep dives, risk ratings, escalation recommendations, clear timelines, and recommended containment steps. Even better, they can deliver them formatted to your specification.

This runs contrary to a common belief that AI outputs are vague or incomplete. In reality, when properly configured and integrated with your environment, AI can deliver faster, clearer answers than a human-first process because it’s drawing from complete telemetry in real time.

Why Humans Alone Cannot Scale Incident Response

The volume of alerts continues to grow. Cloud expansion, SaaS sprawl, remote work, and AI-driven threats all increase signal volume.

Yet SOC headcount doesn’t scale at the same rate.

There are three reasons human-only incident response falls short:

Cognitive Limits: Analysts can only process so much information at once. Correlating multi-source logs across distributed infrastructure is mentally demanding.

Fatigue and Burnout: Incident response is high-pressure work. Repetitive triage leads to alert fatigue. Mistakes increase under stress.

Time Constraints: Humans work within a shift cycle, but bad actors do not. With AI, this is no longer a concern. AI systems can work 24/7 without impacting performance, remembering previous incidents, or losing context between shifts.

This doesn’t mean taking humans out of the loop but rather promoting them to higher-level tasks.

AI and the Modern Incident Response Lifecycle

AI-based incident response also fits well with existing models, such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s SP 800-61 incident handling model.

The classic lifecycle follows the path of preparation, detection, containment, eradication, recovery, and lessons learned. AI enhances all of these stages.

AI models continuously analyze performance metrics, anomalies, and behavioral drift, especially critical in AI-powered systems that suffer from probabilistic failure modes such as model drift or hallucination.

Traditional IT monitoring wasn’t designed for these scenarios. AI-driven detection can identify subtle degradation patterns before humans notice them.

Once an incident is identified, AI can suggest containment steps, such as traffic throttling, model rollback, feature flag disablement, API rate limiting and account isolation.

It can also model impact scenarios before running them.

This is where AI delivers the greatest efficiency gains, as it can reconstruct timelines, compare model versions, detect data drift, and annotate adversarial behaviors to frameworks such as MITRE ATLAS. It can also point out demographic disparities in decisioning systems.

Instead of manually interrogating models and logs, analysts review AI-generated findings and validate conclusions.

Reporting And Compliance

For organizations operating under emerging AI regulations (such as the EU AI Act) incident documentation is critical.

AI can automatically generate structured reports that include the nature of the incident and its severity; affected systems; remediation actions; and the timeline.

That means faster regulatory reporting and stronger audit readiness.

What Enabling AI Incident Response Requires

AI is not a solo operation. For it to optimize processes effectively, it requires:

Security tool integration

Threat intelligence feed access

Escalation procedures

Baselines for monitoring

This means that AI needs to be operationalized, not just implemented.

SOC teams looking to make this transition should assess current data sources and look for integration points, develop standardized alert taxonomies and severity levels, and develop reporting requirements for executives and regulators. They also need to implement human validation points, and train analysts to monitor AI results instead of creating everything by hand.

It’s not about taking jobs away from analysts. It’s about reworking processes to have AI correlate data and generate reports, and have humans make decisions.

AI Incident Response for AI Systems

There’s another layer to consider. AI incident response must address the unique failure modes of probabilistic systems.

Unlike traditional software, AI systems can fail due to the following reasons:

These failures may not always be visible as outages, but can be visible as accuracy degradation or bias. Humans alone cannot identify subtle statistical anomalies in millions of predictions.

AI systems, on the other hand, are capable of monitoring accuracy thresholds, fairness scores, drift scores, and confidence distributions.

The Human Investment Required

However, there are costs involved in making the transition to AI-powered incident response. These include the costs of integration engineering, governance frameworks, monitoring infrastructure, and the cost of training analysts.

However, the human effort required on an ongoing basis drops significantly. Rather than spending hours gathering evidence, analysts can read summaries generated by AI in minutes. Instead of writing board-ready reports from scratch, they simply verify structured reports. While once they were correlating tools manually, they now supervise automated investigations.

The result is not fewer humans, but more effective ones.

The Bigger Question: How Fast Do You Need Answers?

Here’s the behavioral shift security leaders should consider:

How soon do you have to be able to give the right answers to your board, customers, regulators, or media after an incident occurs? Is it hours, days, or minutes?

In a world where AI can start investigating right away and come up with structured results in minutes, it becomes a competitive disadvantage to not be using AI.

AI does not substitute human judgment. It speeds up discovery, enables structured reporting, fights fatigue, improves consistency, and boosts efficiency.

Humans are still vital, but they cannot by themselves scale incident response in today’s world.

The future SOC is not AI versus analysts. It is AI doing the heavy lifting of data analysis, pattern identification, and reporting, and analysts bringing their expertise, values, and strategic thinking.

Incident response will always need intelligent people.

But with AI, those people can finally operate at the speed the business demands.

[18] Security Affairs - 12 Million exposed .env files reveal widespread security failures

12 Million exposed .env files reveal widespread security failures

Mysterium VPN found 12M IPs exposing .env files, leaking credentials and revealing widespread security misconfigurations worldwide.

Configuration mistakes rarely trigger alarms. A forgotten deny rule, an overlooked server setting, or a full project folder uploaded to production can quietly expose a company’s most sensitive secrets. In many cases, those secrets live inside simple environment files known as .env files.

Researchers at Mysterium VPN identified 12,088,677 IP addresses serving publicly accessible .env-style files.

“Researchers here at Mysterium VPN identified over 12 million IP addresses with publicly accessible .env-style files, revealing credentials and tokens, including JWT signing keys, API keys, database passwords, and service tokens.” reads the report published by Mysterium VPN. “The United States leads the count with nearly 2.8 million exposed IPs, accounting for around 23% of the total IP pool. The issue is global: Japan (1.1M), Germany (777K), India (652K), France (636K), and the UK (583K) also have substantial exposures, showing that this is a global security hygiene problem.”

These files exposed database credentials, API keys, JWT signing secrets, cloud tokens, and other sensitive values. The scale reveals a widespread operational hygiene problem affecting organizations across industries and regions.

A .env file stores key-value pairs that applications load at startup. Developers use them for database URLs, OAuth secrets, SMTP credentials, cloud access keys, and third-party tokens. The format stays simple and convenient. That same simplicity creates risk. If a server allows access to hidden files, anyone can request “/.env” and download live credentials without exploiting a vulnerability.

Attackers who retrieve these secrets skip the break-in phase entirely. They log in with valid credentials, query databases, forge authentication tokens, abuse APIs, or access cloud storage. OWASP guidance stresses strict secret control, rotation, auditing, and least-privilege scoping because exposed secrets often lead directly to compromise.

The exposure spans the globe. The United States accounts for nearly 2.8 million affected IPs, followed by Japan, Germany, India, France, the UK, Singapore, Ireland, Canada, and Australia. Large cloud and hosting footprints explain part of the distribution, but the pattern points to repeated deployment and configuration mistakes across ecosystems—not a single flawed platform.

The consequences can escalate quickly. Database credentials enable data theft and privilege escalation. API keys invite financial abuse and spam campaigns. Leaked JWT secrets allow attackers to forge tokens and hijack accounts. SMTP credentials open the door to phishing from legitimate domains. Cloud storage keys can expose backups, identity documents, and internal files.

These exposures usually stem from preventable errors: missing deny rules for hidden files, reverse proxies forwarding sensitive paths, static roots pointing to entire project directories, container images embedding secrets, or forgotten backup files such as .env.bak or .env.old. Attackers routinely scan for these predictable patterns.

When teams discover an exposed .env file, they must treat the event as a full security incident. Remove public access immediately, purge caches, and rotate every secret in the file. Invalidate tokens, review logs for suspicious access, and implement automated secret scanning in repositories and CI pipelines.

Long term, organizations need layered defenses. Block hidden and backup files at the server and CDN level. Move secrets out of web-accessible directories and into centralized secret management systems with audit logs and automated rotation. Scope keys to minimal permissions, enforce network restrictions, and adopt short-lived tokens. Deploy only approved artifacts and validate that no sensitive files remain publicly reachable.

The Mysterium VPN findings highlight a systemic issue: secret exposure continues at massive scale because teams treat configuration as an afterthought. Security teams must embed secret governance into development workflows, deployment pipelines, and infrastructure baselines. Without that shift, a single overlooked file will keep turning routine deployments into full-scale breaches.

ManoMano data breach impacted 38 Million customer accounts

European DIY platform ManoMano suffered a data breach via a third-party provider, exposing personal data of 38 million customers.

European DIY e-commerce platform ManoMano disclosed a major data breach affecting 38 million customers. Hackers accessed personal information by compromising a third-party service provider, prompting notifications and potential security measures for impacted users across multiple countries.

ManoMano is a European e-commerce platform specializing in DIY, home improvement, gardening, and tools. Founded in 2013, it connects consumers with a wide range of products—from power tools and plumbing supplies to outdoor furniture and gardening equipment—offered by multiple sellers, including brands and independent retailers.

ManoMano confirmed to BleepingComputer that it discovered a security breach in January 2026 affecting 38 million customers. The incident involved a third-party service provider, whose unauthorized access led to the extraction of personal data linked to customer accounts and service interactions. The company has notified affected users and is investigating the scope of the compromise.

“In January 2026, we identified unauthorized access linked to this provider, which resulted in the unauthorized extraction of certain personal data associated with customer accounts and customer service interactions.” the company told BleepingComputer.

According to the data breach notification sent to the impacted customers, the exposed data includes: first name, last name, email address, telephone number, and your eventual interactions with our customer service.

The company pointed out that user passwords were not compromised.

Upon detecting the breach, the company immediately blocked the compromised account and revoked the subcontractor’s access. Enhanced data access controls were implemented internally and for all subcontractors. Authorities, including CNIL, ANSSI, and the Cyber Emergency Île-de-France platform, were informed to ensure proper oversight and response.

“As soon as the incident was identified, we immediately took all necessary measures to protect your data.

The analyses conducted by our cyber security teams allowed for the quick identification of the compromised account, which was blocked on the same day the incident was discovered. Subsequently, we revoked all of our subcontractor’s access to our customers’ data.” reads the data breach notification sent to the impacted users.

“We have also implemented reinforced controls on data access, both within our company and at our other subcontractors. Finally, we informed the CNIL (French National Commission for Information Technology and Civil Liberties), the ANSSI (French National Agency for the Security of Information Systems) and the Cyber Emergency Île-de-France platform.”

Trend Micro fixes two critical flaws in Apex One

Trend Micro fixed two critical Apex One flaws enabling remote code execution on vulnerable Windows systems and urged immediate updates.

Trend Micro has addressed two critical vulnerabilities in Apex One that could allow attackers to achieve remote code execution on affected Windows systems. The company released security updates and strongly urged customers to apply the patches promptly to prevent potential exploitation and protect their environments from compromise.

Trend Micro Apex One is an all-in-one advanced endpoint security solution. It provides ransomware protection, zero-day threat defense, EDR, predictive machine learning, DLP, and virtual patching via a single agent.

The first vulnerability addressed by the security firm is a Console Directory Traversal Remote Code Execution issue tracked as CVE-2025-71210 (CVSS score of 9.8).

“A vulnerability in the Trend Micro Apex One management console could allow a remote attacker to upload malicious code and execute commands on affected installations.” reads the advisory. “For this particular vulnerability, an attacker must have access to the Trend Micro Apex One Management Console, so customers that have their console’s IP address exposed externally should consider mitigating factors such as source restrictions if not already applied.”

The second vulnerability fixed by the company is a Console Directory Traversal Remote Code Execution issue, tracked as CVE-2025-71211 (CVSS score of 9.8). The report states that the vulnerability is similar in scope to CVE-2025-71210 but impacts a different executable.

“A vulnerability in the Trend Micro Apex One management console could allow a remote attacker to upload malicious code and execute commands on affected installations. This vulnerability is similar in scope to CVE-2025-71210 but affects a different executable.” reads the report. “For this particular vulnerability, an attacker must have access to the Trend Micro Apex One Management Console, so customers that have their console’s IP address exposed externally should consider mitigating factors such as source restrictions if not already applied.”

The researchers Jacky Hsieh and Charles Yang @ CoreCloud Tech reported both flaws through the TrendAI’s Zero Day Initiative. The SaaS versions have already been mitigated, and no customer action is required.

Trend Micro addressed the vulnerabilities in the SaaS Apex One versions and released Critical Patch Build 14136.

The company also fixes two high-severity privilege escalation flaws (CVE-2025-71212: Scan Engine Link Following Local Privilege Escalation Vulnerability, CVE-2025-71213: Origin Validation Error Local Privilege Escalation Vulnerability) in the Windows agent and four issues impacting the macOS agent.

The cybersecurity firm did not reveal if these vulnerabilities have been exploited in attacks in the wild.

Fake Fedex Email Delivers Donuts!

It’s Friday, let’s have a look at another simple piece of malware to close a busy week! I received a Fedex notification about a delivery. Usually, such emails are simple phishing attacks that redirect you to a fake login page to collect your credentials. Here, it was a bit different:

Nothing really fancy but it is effective and uses interesting techniques. The attached archive called "fedex_shipping_document.7z" (SHA256: a02d54db4ecd6a02f886b522ee78221406aa9a50b92d30b06efb86b9a15781f5 ) contains a Windows script (.bat file) with the same filename. This script, not really obfuscated and easy to understand, receiveds a low VT score, only 12/61!

First, il will generate some environment variables and implement persistence through a Run key:

The variable name "!contract" contains the path of a script copy in %APPDATA%\Rail\EXPRESSIO.cmd. The threat actor does not use the classic environment variable format “%VAR%” but “!var!”. This is expanded at execution time, meaning it reflects the current value inside loops and blocks[1]. It’s enabled via this command

Simple but nice trick to defeat simple search of "%..%"!

Then a PowerShell one-liner is invoked. The Powershell payload is located in the script (at the end) and Bas64-encoded. A nice trick is that the very first characters of the Base64 payload makes it undetectable by tools like base64dump! PowerShell extracts it through a regular expression:

Once the payload decoded, it is piped to another PowerShell:

The PowerShell implements different behaviors. First, it will create a Mutex on the victim’s computer:

Strange, it seems that some anti-debugging and anti-sandoxing are not completely implemented. By example, the scripts gets the number of CPU cores (a classic) but it’s never tested!

The script waits for the presence of an « explorer » process (which means that a user is logged in) otherwise it exists:

There is a long Base64-encoded variable that contains a payload that has been AES encrypted. The IV and salt are extracted and the payload decrypted. No time to loose, run the script into the Powershell debugger and dump the decrypted data in a file:

The decrypted data is the next stage: a shellcode. This one will be injected into the explorer process and a new thread started:

This behavior is typical to DonutLoader[2].

The shell code connects to the C2 server: 204[.]10[.]160[.]190:7003. It's a good old XWorm!

Gottumukkala out, Andersen in as acting CISA director

Madhu Gottumukkala is out as acting director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, with current agency executive director for cybersecurity Nick Andersen replacing him as the interim leader.

News of Gottumukkala’s departure breaks one day after CyberScoop reported on widespread dismay with the agency’s performance during the first year of the Trump administration, with significant criticism aimed at Gottumukkala’s leadership on both sides of the aisle after a number of unflattering stories about his stewardship.

“Madhu Gottumukkala has done a remarkable job in a thankless task of helping reform CISA back to its core statutory mission,” a Department of Homeland Security official told CyberScoop Thursday. “He tackled the woke, weaponized, and bloated bureaucracy that existed at CISA, wrangling contracts to save American taxpayer dollars.”

Gottumukkala, served as chief information officer under then-South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, now secretary of DHS, before he was picked as deputy director of the agency. Sean Plankey’s nomination to serve as full-time director of CISA has stalled, leaving Gottumukkala as the acting director in his place.

Gottumukkala will take on a new role at DHS, as director of strategic implementation. Andersen has won more favorable reviews from industry and cyber professionals during his tenure at CISA than did Gottumukkala, whom some still praised for his technical acumen.

ABC News first reported the news on the Gottumukkala and Andersen moves. The news comes the same day as reports about another leadership change at the agency, with Cybersecurity Dive first reporting on the exit of Robert Costello as CISA CIO.

While some officials CyberScoop spoke to for its story about CISA this week believed the agency had some duplication, most thought the Trump administration had cut far deeper than needed, damaging the agency.

Andersen has held several IT and cybersecurity roles in the public sector over the past two decades, including positions at the Coast Guard, Navy and Department of Energy.

[25] Cyberscoop - Project Compass is Europol’s new playbook for taking on The Com

Project Compass is Europol’s new playbook for taking on The Com

A global law enforcement effort has taken root to combat The Com, a sprawling nihilistic network of thousands of minors and young adults engaged in various forms of cybercrime, including physical violence and extortion.

Project Compass, an operation coordinated by Europol with support from 28 countries, including all members of the Five Eyes, has resulted in the arrest of 30 perpetrators since the initiative got underway in January 2025, authorities said in a news release Thursday.

Officials said sustained countermeasures have contributed to the full and partial identification of 179 perpetrators, while the operation has also safeguarded four victims and identified up to 62 victims.

The Com is splintered into three primary subsets with different objectives the FBI describes as Hacker Com, In Real Life Com and Extortion Com. Crimes attributed to group members have grown increasingly complex, with perpetrators going to great lengths to mask identities, hide financial transactions and launder money.

“These networks deliberately target children in the digital spaces where they feel most at ease,” Anna Sjöberg, head of Europol’s European Counter Terrorism Centre, said in a statement.

Various branches of The Com have been linked to high-profile crimes over the past few years, and law enforcement has responded with heightened activity and interest in the group’s activities.

The Com is vast — many perpetrators remain at large and even more victims are still suffering and awaiting aid.

This growing global effort to thwart shifting crime trends with appropriate resources has built a foundation that will foster results beyond those achieved to date, said Allison Nixon, chief research officer at Unit 221B.

“How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time,” she told CyberScoop. “The Com represents a major social problem impacting youth, and peoples’ expectations need to be realistic. These early numbers and ramping up effort over time is what success looks like and we need to encourage that.”

An effective police response to The Com requires a different way of thinking and retooling, “but it is more solvable than crime originating from hostile nations,” Nixon said.

Project Compass is built around an information-sharing network, which enables each of the partner nations to assist with investigations across various specialized units. Countries are also sharing advice for preventative measures and mobilizing data sprints to bring intelligence together for ongoing cases.

“Project Compass allows us to intervene earlier, safeguard victims and disrupt those who exploit vulnerability for extremist purposes,” Sjöberg said. “No country can address this threat alone — and through this cooperation, we are closing the gaps they try to hide in.”

Europol did not identify the 30 people arrested under Project Compass thus far. Yet, at least some of those cases are public.

Authorities during the past year have arrested multiple members of a Com offshoot known as 764, which is a growing online threat to coerce vulnerable children to produce child sexual abuse material of themselves, gor material, self mutilation, sibling abuse, animal abuses and other acts of violence.

Two alleged leaders of 764, Leonidas Varagiannis and Prasan Nepal, were arrested and charged for directing and distributing CSAM in April.

Tony Christoper Long and Alexis Aldair Chavez both pleaded guilty late last year to multiple crimes linked to their involvement with the extremist group. Other alleged 764 members have been arrested in the United States more recently, including Erik Lee Madison and Aaron Corey.

[26] The Register - Double whammy: Steaelite RAT bundles data theft, ransomware in one evil tool

Double whammy: Steaelite RAT bundles data theft, ransomware in one evil tool

Credential and cryptocurrency theft, live surveillance, ransomware - an attacker's Swiss Army knife

A new remote access trojan (RAT) being sold on cybercrime networks enables double extortion attacks on Windows machines by bundling ransomware and data theft, along with credential and cryptocurrency stealers, live surveillance, and a whole host of other illicit capabilities, all controllable from a centralized dashboard.

BlackFog researchers first spotted the malware, called Steaelite and touted as "fully undetectable" and the "best Windows RAT," in November 2025. It works across Windows 10 and 11, with an Android module reportedly in development.

Steaelite's operator interface runs entirely in the browser, and the RAT starts stealing victims' data even before the criminals open the dashboard.

The dashboard includes a primary toolbar plus two additional sections, with the primary toolbar alone including modules for remote code execution, file management, live streaming, webcam and microphone access, process management, clipboard monitoring, password recovery, installed program enumeration, location tracking, arbitrary file execution, URL opening, DDoS attacks, and VB.NET payload compilation.

If a criminal is seeking more - like locking up victims' files and extorting them for cryptocurrency - an "advanced tools" panel includes capabilities for ransomware deployment, hidden RDP, Windows Defender disabling and exclusion management, and persistence installation.

Plus, a third "developer tools" panel adds keylogging, client-to-victim chat, file searching, USB spreading, a bot-killing feature that removes competing malware, message box delivery, wallpaper modification, UAC bypass, and a clipper that swaps cryptocurrency wallet addresses during copy-paste operations.

The clipper can silently transfer the victims' cryptocurrency to the attacker - without the victim ever knowing - by monitoring the clipboard for wallet addresses and replacing them with an attacker-controlled address before the paste completes.

"The listing has been bumped consistently across multiple forum threads with 87 messages at the time of writing, and a promotional video demonstrating the tool's capabilities has been published on YouTube, a common distribution tactic for commercial remote access trojans looking to reach buyers outside of traditional forum ecosystems," BlackFog wrote.

In addition to being an all-in-one RAT, this new malware makes it even easier for would-be criminals to pull off double extortion attacks - where the crooks first steal data, then encrypt victims' systems, and threaten to leak the stolen files if the victim refuses to pay a ransom.

"Previously, double extortion required malware for initial access and exfiltration, then a separate ransomware payload for encryption, often involving coordination between initial access brokers and ransomware affiliates," BlackFog's team wrote. "Steaelite puts both in the same interface, and the automated credential harvesting means data theft fires before the operator even interacts with the dashboard."

Additionally, once the Android version goes live - and assuming it works as planned - a single Steaelite license could cover corporate Windows computers as well as the mobile devices employees use for authentication and messaging, the researchers note. ®

[27] The Register - Suspected Nork digital intruders caught breaking into US healthcare, education orgs

Suspected Nork digital intruders caught breaking into US healthcare, education orgs

Who is knocking at the Dohdoor?

Digital intruders with possible links to North Korea have been infecting US education and healthcare sectors with a never-before-seen backdoor since at least December, according to security researchers.

"We observed that the attacker had infected several educational institutions, including a university that is connected to several other institutions, indicating a potential wider attack surface," Cisco Talos researcher Chetan Raghuprasad told The Register. "Additionally, one of the affected entities was a healthcare facility, specifically for elderly care.

"Based on the nature of the victimology in the current intrusions, the actor likely has a motive for financial gain," Raghuprasad added.

Talos spotted the ongoing campaign, attributed to a group it tracks as UAT-10027, and says "with low confidence" that it's a North Korean crew based on similarities to Lazarus Group and other Pyongyang-backed gangs.

The attackers likely gain initial access via social engineering and phishing, we're told, and the multi-stage infection ultimately delivers a new backdoor, Dohdoor, which shares similar technical characteristics to Lazarus Group's Lazarloader malware.

After gaining access - potentially through a phishing email - the intruders execute a PowerShell downloader that runs a Windows batch script dropper from a remote staging server. The batch script then orchestrates a dynamic-link library (DLL) sideloading technique to execute a malicious Windows DLL named "propsys.dll" or "batmeter.dll."

The DLL, which Talos calls "Dohdoor," operates as a loader, and it downloads, decrypts, and executes malicious payloads within legitimate Windows processes. This gives the intruders backdoor access to the victim's environment so it can download the next payload - a Cobalt Strike Beacon - into the machine's memory.

UAT-10027 uses several stealthy techniques to help it avoid detection, including setting up command-and-control (C2) domains using Cloudflare infrastructure and using a technique called DNS-over-HTTPS to resolve the C2 server IP address. This helps the attackers bypass DNS security tools by ensuring all outbound traffic from compromised machines looks like legitimate HTTPS traffic to a trusted IP address.

Dohoor also uses a technique called process hollowing to inject the payload into a legitimate Windows binary, allowing the malware to run without being detected.

Additionally, Talos observed the new backdoor using an endpoint detection and response (EDR) bypass technique to bypass endpoint security tools that monitor Windows API calls. The backdoor does this by by unhooking system calls through user mode hooks in ntdll.dll.

"The NTDLL unhooking technique used to bypass EDR monitoring by identifying and restoring system call stubs aligns with features found in earlier Lazarloader variants," Talos' researchers Alex Karkins and Chetan Raghuprasad said in a Thursday report.

They also noted that using DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) via Cloudflare's DNS service, the process hollowing technique, and sideloading malicious DLLs in disguised file name "propsys.dll," have all been used in earlier Lazarus campaigns.

"While UAT-10027's malware shares technical overlaps with the Lazarus Group, the campaign's focus on the education and health care sectors deviates from Lazarus' typical profile of cryptocurrency and defense targeting," the duo said.

That assertion may be slightly out of date: Symantec and Carbon Black threat hunters earlier this week warned that Lazarus has begun using Medusa ransomware in extortion attacks targeting at least one US healthcare organization.

One of Lazarus' most prolific subgroups, Andariel, which acts as the cyber-arm of North Korea's military intelligence agency, has previously used Maui and Play ransomware in its intrusions - including those targeting the healthcare sector. Additionally, Kimsuky, another one of Pyongyang's intelligence-gathering goon squads, has hit the education sector in its campaigns. ®

Ransomware payments cratered in 2025, but attacks surged to record highs

Smaller crews piled in as old names splintered and rebranded

Ransomware payments cratered in 2025, but it seems like the cybercrooks launching the attacks didn't get the memo.

That's the headline from Chainalysis' 2026 Crypto Crime Report, which shows total on-chain ransomware payments falling for a second straight year, even as victim counts and leak site pressure continue to climb.

Ransomware gangs pulled in about $820 million in 2025, roughly 8 percent less than the year before, as the share of victims paying dropped to an all-time low of 28 percent. That drop might sound like progress if the wider picture weren't so bleak: the median ransom demand jumped from $12,738 in 2024 to $59,556 in 2025, and the number of publicly claimed attacks climbed along with it.

"Despite the relative stability in total payments, ransomware attacks surged across multiple vectors in 2025, with eCrime.ch data showing a 50 percent YoY increase in claimed ransomware victims, marking the most active year on record," Chainalysis said.

2025 delivered plenty of high-profile examples of this "most active" year. Jaguar Land Rover suffered what's been described as the costliest cyber incident in UK history, and Marks & Spencer endured prolonged operational disruption after a Scattered Spider-linked breach that wiped hundreds of millions off its market value.

While 2025 had its share of mega-breaches, the real story is volume. Smaller, opportunistic groups are behind a growing share of extortion attempts, even as the old guard – LockBit, BlackCat, and friends – have been raided, sanctioned, arrested, or simply popped back up under new logos. What's left is a crowded field of spin-offs and opportunists taking their chances, and plenty of these incidents never show up as a clean, traceable crypto payout on a blockchain explorer.

Ex-L3Harris exec jailed 7 years for selling exploits to Russia

Wynn Resorts takes attacker's word for it that stolen staff data was deleted

North Korea's Lazarus Group targets healthcare orgs with Medusa ransomware

Security firm Emsisoft's 2025 ransomware data reinforces that picture. More than 8,000 organizations were publicly named on leak sites last year – a sharp jump from previous years.

Developed economies are still squarely in the crosshairs. The United States leads the pack yet again, followed by Canada, Germany, the UK, and the rest of Western Europe. Manufacturing, financial, and professional services took plenty of hits, and in Canada and Germany, attackers showed a particular appetite for supply chains, logistics networks, and critical infrastructure. In the US, every major sector – including government and critical infrastructure – saw year-over-year increases in the number of claimed victims.

Chainalysis's report also offered a glimpse behind the scenes, where ransomware now looks less like a single criminal enterprise and more like a supply chain.

Initial access brokers (IABs) – the middlemen selling ready-made footholds into corporate networks – received at least $14 million in on-chain payments in 2025. That's small compared to ransomware's $820 million haul, but Chainalysis found that spikes in IAB payments often precede increases in ransomware payments and US victim leak posts by roughly 30 days. Access gets bought, and a few weeks later, someone's name appears on a leak site.

The Chainalysis report suggests that ransomware isn't shrinking so much as shifting, with fewer victims paying but more organizations getting hit, higher demands, and a thriving access-for-sale marketplace quietly teeing up the next wave of leak-site disclosures. ®

[29] The Register - French DIY etailer ManoMano admits customer data stolen

French DIY etailer ManoMano admits customer data stolen

Crooks claim they helped themselves to over 37M accounts during January hit on subcontractor

French online marketplace ManoMano is warning customers their personal data was siphoned off after a cyberattack hit one of its customer support subcontractors – and criminals are already claiming the haul is far larger than the company's carefully worded notice suggests.

ShinyHunters demands $1.5M not to leak Vegas casino and resort chain data

In a letter sent to affected users, seen by The Register, ManoMano said it was informed that a customer service provider was hit by a cyberattack in January 2026 that led to "the unauthorized download of personal data associated with your customer account." The company said its investigation found that "an illegal data extraction was carried out from the account of one of our subcontractor's agents."

The exposed data includes first and last names, email addresses, phone numbers, and "any potential exchanges you may have had with our customer service department." ManoMano stressed that "your password is not affected" and that customer data "remains intact and has not been modified."

ManoMano hasn't named the hacked subcontractor, but unconfirmed reports claim the vector for the attack was Zendesk, the widely used – and frequently hacked – support platform.

Meanwhile, over on BreachForums, a user calling themselves "Indra" is claiming responsibility for the ManoMano breach and is boasting about a dataset far larger than anything the retailer has publicly confirmed, alleging tens of millions of user records were swept up in the breach.

The actor alleges access to 37.8 million user accounts totaling roughly 43 GB of data, along with 935,000 after-sales service tickets and more than 13,500 attachments. The claimed haul reportedly spans multiple European markets, including France, Spain, Italy, Germany, and the UK.

In its notification, the retailer said it "immediately took all necessary measures to protect your data," blocked the compromised account the same day it was discovered, and "revoked all of our subcontractor's access to our customers' data." It also reported the incident to France's data protection watchdog, CNIL, and the national cybersecurity agency, ANSSI.

The company warned that the stolen information could be used in phishing or impersonation attempts and advised customers to "remain particularly vigilant for potential fraud attempts."

The company is a dedicated third-party marketplace that hooks up DIY and home improvement buyers with verified merchants. It facilitates sales for various sellers across Europe.

While ManoMano is framing the breach as a subcontractor incident, the alleged scale of the compromise suggests the subcontractor had access to a substantial volume of customer data. ®

Cops back Dutch telco Odido after second wave of ShinyHunters leaks

Company refuses to pay ransom as attackers threaten larger daily dumps

The Netherlands' national police is backing Odido's refusal to pay a ransom after ShinyHunters leaked a second round of records belonging to the telco.

In the early hours of Friday morning, the cybercriminals behind ShinyHunters leaked 1 million Odido records for the second day in a row.

According to Have I Been Pwned, which is ingesting the data from each day's leaks, the first million contained 317,000 unique email addresses, while the second round consisted of 371,000.

Details associated with those accounts include bank account numbers, other basic personal information, passport numbers, driving licenses, and customer service comments.

ShinyHunters' website indicates that it is once again gearing up for a third round of leaks on February 28. If this round is of a similar scale, it would push the total number of affected accounts past 1 million.

After the third round, the cybercrime group promised to begin leaking 2 million records a day. It claims to have stolen around 21 million in total.

Odido first confirmed the scale of the data leak weeks ago, saying 6.2 million customers were affected by the attack. The company's website is currently not reachable at the time of writing, although the website for subsidiary Ben, whose customers were also caught up in the data theft, is still working.

The telco has also confirmed that it will not be paying a ransom, an unknown sum that ShinyHunters is demanding to stop the flow of leaked information into the public domain.

The Netherlands' national police (Politie) has reissued an alert advising organizations in similar positions to avoid paying ransoms, just like Odido.

"Our advice to ransomware victims is: don't pay if criminals demand a ransom," said Stan Duijf, head of operations responsible for combating cybercrime at the Politie. "After all, if they are paid, their business model remains viable.

"The ultimate decision is up to the victim, but you can't assume your data is safe if you pay. We know from research that criminals don't always delete the data, and may resell it or demand more money. If companies are hacked, it's crucial that they contact the police as soon as possible, so that together we can limit the damage and secure the evidence."

The Politie said Odido was fully complying with its investigation into the attack, and agreed with the company's advice to remain vigilant to potential targeted phishing attacks, given the volume of data stolen.

The Register requested more information from Odido.

The last public statement made by the telco, penned by Søren Abildgaard, CEO at Odido Netherlands, and updated on February 26, said: "Our focus has always been on our customers, and that will remain so.

"On the advice of leading cybersecurity advisors and relevant government agencies, such as the police, Odido has decided not to negotiate with these criminals or allow themselves to be blackmailed by them.

"We remain committed to supporting and protecting our customers and employees in the best possible way."

Customers are being offered a 24-month subscription to F-Secure's digital security package, which provides protection for devices against malware, phishing, and other threats. ®

[31] TechCrunch Security - India disrupts access to popular developer platform Supabase with blocking order
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[TAM METİN - 1072 kelime]
Supabase, a popular developer database platform, is facing disruptions in India — one of its key markets — has been blocked in India, TechCrunch has learned. New Delhi ordered internet providers to block its website, resulting in patchy access across networks.

The blocking order was issued on February 24 under Section 69A of India’s Information Technology Act, according to a source familiar with the matter. The provision empowers the government to restrict public access to online content.

The Indian government did not publicly cite a reason for the move, and it was not immediately clear whether the action was linked to a cybersecurity concern, copyright complaint, or another issue. It was also unclear how long the restrictions would remain in place.

Access to Supabase has been inconsistent in India over the past several days, with the San Francisco-based company acknowledging the issue in posts on social media starting Wednesday. While the restrictions were first reported by Supabase on Reliance Industries’ JioFiber network, users have since flagged similar problems across multiple internet providers and telecom networks. In one post on Friday, Supabase tagged India’s IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, asking him to intervene and restore access, though the company later removed the message and said in a subsequent update that the site remained blocked for many users in the country.

We understand many users in India continue to be blocked from accessing Supabase. We acknowledge the difficulties this is causing for our users there. Supabase continues to follow up through all available channels to resolve this issue.We continue to advise affected customers…

An Indian founder, who asked not to be named to avoid potential repercussions, told TechCrunch they had stopped seeing new user sign-ups from India over the past two to three days. A technology consultant working with local startups, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they were unable to reliably access Supabase for both development and production purposes.

While Supabase suggested workarounds such as switching DNS settings or using a VPN (which reroute internet traffic to bypass local restrictions), the founder said such steps were not practical for most end users.

At the time of publication, TechCrunch was able to verify that supabase.co remained inaccessible on ACT Fibernet, JioFiber and Airtel connections in New Delhi. However, two users on ACT Fibernet in Bengaluru said they were still able to access the service, suggesting the restrictions may be unevenly implemented.

Notably, Supabase’s main website remained accessible in India — but its underlying developer infrastructure did not.

India is Supabase’s fourth-largest source of traffic, accounting for about 9% of global visits, according to data from Similarweb, highlighting the potential fallout for the country’s developer ecosystem. The platform’s global traffic jumped more than 111% year over year to about 4.2 million visits in January. In India, visits rose roughly 179% to about 365,000, compared with a 168.5% increase in the U.S. to about 627,000.

The incident highlights broader concerns about India’s website blocking regime, said Raman Jit Singh Chima, Asia Pacific policy director at Access Now.

“This is a simple fact that has grave consequences for developers and others,” he told TechCrunch. “You don’t know where you can safely run projects without the danger that something might happen where it gets blocked, and suddenly you’re scrambling to find a way.”

India has previously faced criticism over broad website blocking measures. In 2014, authorities briefly restricted access to developer platform GitHub, along with services such as Vimeo, Pastebin and Weebly, during a security probe. Users on some Indian networks in 2023 also reported that a key GitHub content domain had been blocked by certain ISPs, according to earlier reports.

Founded in 2020 by CEO Paul Copplestone and CTO Ant Wilson, Supabase positions itself as an open-source alternative to Firebase built on PostgreSQL. The startup has gained traction amid rising interest in so-called “vibe coding” tools and AI-driven app development, and has raised about $380 million across three funding rounds since September 2024, lifting its valuation to $5 billion.

India’s Ministry of Electronics and IT, as well as telecom providers including ACT Fibernet, Bharti Airtel, and Reliance Jio, did not respond to requests for comment. Copplestone and Wilson also did not respond.

[32] TechCrunch Security - CISA replaces acting director after a bumbling year on the job

[TAM METİN - 798 kelime]
This week it was reported that U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency is in dire shape, after a year of cuts, layoffs, and furloughs under the Trump administration. Now the agency has replaced its top acting leader, a CISA spokesperson tells TechCrunch.

The move to replace Madhu Gottumukkala as the acting director of CISA, an agency under the Department of Homeland Security that oversees cybersecurity and technical protection across the federal government, comes after a tumultuous year serving as the agency’s top boss.

Gottumukkala struggled to lead the agency during his tenure as acting director and caused security headaches, including the uploading of sensitive government documents to ChatGPT, according to reports. Staffing at the agency was slashed by one-third. Gottumukkala also reportedly failed a counterintelligence polygraph he took in order to view classified documents, and suspended several career officials in response, including the agency’s then-chief security officer.

Before being nominated to CISA as deputy director, Gottumukkala was chief technology officer of South Dakota under then-governor and current Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem.

ABC News was first to report Gottumukkala’s departure.

In a statement shared with TechCrunch on Friday, CISA spokesperson Marci McCarthy claimed Gottumukkala had done a “remarkable job.” McCarthy told TechCrunch that Nick Andersen will replace Gottumukkala as CISA’s new acting director, and that Gottumukkala has been moved to a new position as director of strategic implementation in the Department of Homeland Security, which houses CISA.

Prior to his appointment as acting director to lead CISA, Andersen served as the agency’s top official overseeing its cybersecurity division.

The agency still hasn’t had a permanent Senate-confirmed director since Trump returned to office.

McCarthy said the Trump administration has chosen Sean Plankey to be the agency’s permanent director, which requires a majority vote of approval in the U.S. Senate.

The White House re-nominated Plankey to head CISA in January, after Sen. Ron Wyden last year blocked Plankey’s nomination until the agency agreed to release an unclassified report allegedly describing cybersecurity flaws at phone and telecommunication giants. Wyden demanded the report’s release in the wake of hundreds of hacks targeting U.S. and international phone and internet providers by the China-backed hacking group known as Salt Typhoon. The Senate has yet to schedule Plankey’s nomination hearing.

Nextgov reported Thursday that CISA lost another top senior official, Bob Costello, the agency’s chief information officer tasked with overseeing the agency’s IT systems and data policies. The news outlet reported Gottumukkala tried to transfer Costello but was blocked by unnamed political appointees.

CISA’s spokesperson McCarthy did not address Costello’s departure when asked by TechCrunch, but did not dispute the report.

[33] CSO Online - Security hole could let hackers take over Juniper Networks PTX core routers

The vulnerability is especially dangerous because this model sits in the network core, so attackers could intercept or redirect data, says an expert.

Network admins with Juniper PTX series routers in their environments are being warned to patch immediately, because a newly-discovered critical vulnerability could lead to an unauthenticated threat actor running code with root privileges.

The hole is “especially dangerous, because these devices often sit in the middle of the network, not on the fringes,” said Piyush Sharma, CEO of Tuskira. “If an attacker gains control of a PTX, the impact is bigger than a single device compromise because it can become a traffic vantage point and a control point at the same time. This opens the door to the stealthy interception of data flows, controller redirected traffic, or easy pivots into adjacent networks.”

This issue affects PTX routers running versions of the Junos OS Evolved operating system earlier than 25.4R1-S1-EVO and 25.4R2-EVO. It doesn’t affect the standard Junos OS.

In a notice, Juniper said it isn’t aware of any malicious exploitation of this vulnerability. The hole was found during internal product security testing or research.

The PTX line is a series of modular high performance core routers powered by HPE Juniper Networks’ latest generation of custom Express family ASICs and optimized for 400G and 800G migrations. They offer native 400G and 800G inline MACsec, deep buffering and flexible filtering. The company says they are built for longevity in demanding WAN (wide area network) and data center use cases and deployment scenarios, including core, peering, data center interconnect, data center edge, metro aggregation, and AI data center networking.

In its notice, Juniper says an Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource vulnerability in the On-Box Anomaly detection framework of the operating system allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to execute code as root. The detection framework is enabled by default.

“The On-Box Anomaly detection framework should only be reachable by other internal processes over the internal routing instance, but not over an externally exposed port,” the alert adds. “With the ability to access and manipulate the service to execute code as root, a remote attacker can take complete control of the device.”

To resolve the issue, admins should make sure version 25.4R1-S1-EVO of Junos OS Evolved is installed. They should also note that versions 25.4R2-EVO and 26.2R1-EVO are on the way.

If the update can’t be installed immediately, admins should use access control lists or firewall filters to limit access to only trusted networks and hosts, to reduce the risk of exploitation of this issue. Ensure such filters only permit explicitly required connections and block all others.

Another option is to disable the service by entering request pfe anomalies disable in the operating system’s command line.

Sharma said Juniper vulnerabilities have attracted a lot of attention from hackers over the years because of the premium positioning the routers give if long-term footholds are established. “As a network operating system, Junos sits at the crossroads of major control points like identity, policy, and traffic, which means a single exploit can scale quickly across valuable networks,” he said. “Additionally, these footholds provide attackers a longer window to find and exploit vulnerable devices, since core network gear is painful to apply patching to due to long downtimes.”

To prevent vulnerabilities such as the current flaw from leading to exploitation, organizations need a defense platform that can continuously monitor for anomalies across networks and alert security teams when malicious behavior is detected, he added.

Disclosure of the vulnerability comes as Juniper’s parent firm HPE prepares to introduce new PTX12000 and PTX10002 router families at next week’s Mobile World Congress. HPE bought Juniper last year.

[34] CSO Online - ‘Silent’ Google API key change exposed Gemini AI data

Billing ID keys were turned into Gemini authentication credentials without informing developers.

Google Cloud API keys, normally used as simple billing identifiers for APIs such as Maps or YouTube, could be scraped from websites to give access to private Gemini AI project data, researchers from Truffle Security recently discovered.

According to a Common Crawl scan of websites carried out by the company in November, there were 2,863 live Google API keys that left organizations exposed. This included “major financial institutions, security companies, global recruiting firms, and, notably, Google itself,” Truffle Security said.

The alarming security weakness was caused by a silent change in the status of Google Cloud Platform (GCP) API keys which the company neglected to tell developers about.

For more than a decade, Google’s developer documentation has described these keys, identified by the prefix ‘Aiza’, as a mechanism used to identify a project for billing purposes. Developers generated a key and then pasted it into their client-side HTML code in full public view.

However, with the appearance of the Gemini API (Generative Language API) from late 2023 onwards, it seems that these keys also started acting as authentication keys for sites embedding the Gemini AI Assistant.

Developers might build a site with basic features such as an embedded Maps function whose usage was identified for metering purposes using the original public GCP API key. When they later added Gemini to the same project, to, for example, make available a chatbot or other interactive feature, the same key effectively authenticated access to anything the owner had stored through the Gemini API, including datasets, documents and cached context. Because this is AI, extracting data would be as simple as prompting Gemini to reveal it.

That same access could also be exploited to consume tokens through the API, potentially generating large bills for the owners or exhausting their quotas, said Truffle Security. All an attacker would need to do is view a site’s source code and extract the key.

“Your public Maps key is now a Gemini credential. Anyone who scrapes it can access your uploaded files, cached content, and rack up your AI bill,” the researchers pointed out. “Nobody told you.”

API key exploitation is more than hypothetical. In a different context, a student who reportedly exposed a GCP API key on GitHub last June was left nursing a $55,444 bill (later waived by Google) after it was extracted and re-used by others.

Truffle Security said it disclosed the issue with the keys to Google in November, and the company eventually admitted the issue was a bona fide bug. After being told of the 2,863 exposed keys, the company restricted them from accessing the Gemini API.

On February 19, the 90-day bug disclosure window closed, with Google apparently still working on a more comprehensive fix.

“The initial triage was frustrating; the report was dismissed as ‘Intended Behavior.’ But after providing concrete evidence from Google’s own infrastructure, the GCP VDP team took the issue seriously,” said Truffle Security. “Building software at Google’s scale is extraordinarily difficult, and the Gemini API inherited a key management architecture built for a different era.”

The first job for concerned site admins is to check in the GCP console for keys specifically allowing the Generative Language API. In addition, look for unrestricted keys, now identified by a yellow warning icon. Check if any of these keys are public.

Exposed keys should all be rotated or ‘regenerated,’ with a grace period that considers the effect this will have on downstream apps that have cached the old one.

This vulnerability underlines how small cloud evolution oversights can have wider, unforeseen consequences. Truffle Security noted that Google now says in its roadmap that it is taking steps to remedy the API key problem: API keys created through AI Studio will default to Gemini-only access, and the company will also block leaked keys, notifying customers when they detect this to have happened.

“We’d love to see Google go further and retroactively audit existing impacted keys and notify project owners who may be unknowingly exposed, but honestly, that is a monumental task,” Truffle Security admitted.

Would you be willing to take responsibility for protecting national IT security for that little?

A recent job ad  is causing plenty of head-shaking, suggesting that some government high-ups  appear to be out of touch with the current state of the cybersecurity job market.

There is plenty of evidence that the world needs cybersecurity talent. According to a recent ISC2 survey, 33% of organizations cannot staff their security teams adequately

The result of this shortage is that these professionals are handsomely rewarded — but no-one appears to have told the UK government.

Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ, the UK equivalent of the US’s National Security Agency, or NSA), has just advertised for a chief information security officer. The role, which the ad describes as “one of the most influential cyber security leadership roles in the UK,” offers a maximum salary of £130,000 (about $175,000) — and none of the stock options or other inducements common in industry.

Successful candidates will have “expertise in securing cloud environments and emerging technologies within digital transformation programmes, alongside a strong understanding of regulatory compliance frameworks such as NIST, ISO 27001, GDPR and GovS 007. Professional certifications such as CISSP, CISM or CCISO are highly desirable,” the ad said.

The job ad stresses the importance of the role. “As CISO, you will work with colleagues to set and implement the organisation’s cyber and information security strategy, striking the right balance between capability, acceptable risk and technological progress. You will integrate security governance into a complex set of cross-agency organisational decision-making forums ensuring that information risks are managed effectively.”

It’s a daunting set of responsibility for a senior professional working for an organization responsible for keeping an entire nation safe from cybercriminals and hostile powers, while pulling in a salary roughly equivalent to the salary of a security architect at a mid-level US company.

A critical OpenClaw flaw allowed malicious websites to connect to locally running agents, brute-force passwords without limits, and take full control by exploiting implicit trust in localhost connections.

If you thought running an AI agent locally kept it safely inside your machine’s walls, you’re in for a surprise. Researchers at Oasis Security have disclosed a flaw chain that allowed a malicious website to quietly connect to a locally running OpenClaw agent and take full control.

The issue stems from a fundamental assumption baked into developer tools that anything coming from “localhost” can be trusted. In reality, however, modern browsers allow external websites to open WebSocket connections to local services.

According to Oasis findings, malicious browser pages can silently connect to the OpenClaw gateway, which auto-trusts localhosts and disables rate limits, enabling rapid password brute-forcing and unauthorized device pairing.

“The modern web browser acts as a porous membrane, permitting untrusted, external JavaScript to bridge the gap to local services via WebSockets,” said Jason Soroko, senior fellow at Sectigo. “By relying on a local IP address to grant immunity from rate-limiting and to silently auto-approve device pairings, the system abandons the core tenets of a zero-trust architecture.”

Once hijacked, the attacker can obtain the OpenClaw agent’s high privileges, including autonomous workflows, access to codebases, integrations, and credentials. Oasis researchers called the flaw ClawJacked, tracked under CVE-2026-25253, and reported full proof-of-concept (PoC) code to OpenClaw, which then promptly fixed it.

‘localhost’ became a weaklink

Oasis Security’s research showed how a combination of design choices enabled the flaw. OpenClaw relied on local binding, automatic device pairing, and minimal authentication friction to streamline onboarding.

Because WebSocket connections to localhost are not constrained by traditional cross-origin protections, a hostile website could initiate communication with the agent’s local gateway. From there, weak authentication controls and implicit trust in local origins allow the attacker to pair a device session and begin issuing commands.

“What stands out is that it’s clear that product usefulness improved faster than security,” said Randolph Barr, CISO at Cequence Security. “The design focused on making the developer experience as smooth as possible by using local binding, automatic device pairing, and less friction for connectivity. This made adoption faster but also made defensive controls less effective.”

Gal Moyal of Noma Security echoed this concern that agentic AI tools prioritize seamless developer experience over security. He noted that WebSocket access to localhost is a known browser behavior, “but its intersection with an unthrottled authentication endpoint and automatic device trust from localhost creates a particularly dangerous combination.”

The full attack chain involves a victim visiting a malicious website whose hidden script connects to the locally running OpenClaw gateway via WebSockets, brute-forces its password without rate limits, and silently registers as a trusted device due to implicit localhost trust. Once authenticated, the attacker gains full control of the AI agent and its accessible data and functions.

A larger blast radius

Unlike regular software vulnerabilities, compromised AI agents have a bigger blast radius as they hold sensitive API keys, session tokens, file system access, and the authority to execute tasks across enterprise tools.

Barr emphasized that autonomous systems “aggregate identity, credentials, and workflow authority,” meaning a failure doesn’t occur quietly. Instead, the agent executes actions “with the full authority of the user, at machine speed and machine scale.” In developer environments, that could include modifying code repositories, accessing internal systems, or triggering automated processes.

Soroko described the browser itself as the unexpected attack vector, effectively bypassing the developer’s physical perimeter and “turning a simple background tab into an effective lock-pick.” Oasis noted that the OpenClaw team responded quickly, coordinating disclosure and issuing a fix (OpenClaw v2026.2.25 or later) within 24 hours. However, experts caution that rapid patching alone may not address the broader architectural risks. Organizations deploying AI agents should implement stronger authentication, explicit user approval for session pairing, rate limiting, credential scoping, and behavioral monitoring, they noted.

Prison for trading malware for crypto, sanctions for selling US cyberweapons to its enemies.

The US authorities have made it clear that they will have no truck with any individuals trying to by-pass regulations on trading cyberweapons with hostile powers.

Selling sensitive cyber-exploit components to a Russian company landed Australian citizen Peter Williams with an 87-month prison sentence from the US District Court for the District of Columbia on February 24.

“Williams took trade secrets comprised of national security software and sold them for up to $4 million in crypto currency. These incredibly powerful tools would have allowed Russia to access millions of digital devices,” said US Attorney Jeanine Pirro for the District of Columbia. “By betraying a position of trust and selling sensitive American technology, Williams’ crime is not only one of theft, it is a crime of national security.

On the same day, the Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned Sergey Sergeyevich Zelenyuk and his company, Matrix LLC (trading as Operation Zero) for their acquisition and distribution of cyber tools harmful to US national security.

Operation Zero trades in exploits of software vulnerabilities, and offered rewards to anyone who would provide them with exploits for US products. Among the exploits that Operation Zero acquired were proprietary cyber tools that had been created for the US government. These were then sold to at least one unauthorized user.

“If you steal US trade secrets, we will hold you accountable,” said US Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent. “Treasury will continue to work alongside the rest of the Trump Administration to protect sensitive American intellectual property and safeguard our national security.”

As a result of the sanction, all property or possessions held by Zelenyek and Matrix in the US will be blocked, with the possibility of criminal charges for transaction of any assets.

[38] CSO Online - Why application security must start at the load balancer
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Fri, 27 Feb 2026 11:00:00 +0000
Link: https://www.csoonline.com/article/4138000/why-application-security-must-start-at-the-load-balancer.html

[TAM METİN - 1284 kelime]
Most breaches don’t outsmart your stack; they walk through a permissive load balancer you tuned for speed instead of trust.

For a long time, I thought of the load balancer as a performance device. Its job was to distribute traffic, improve uptime, and make applications feel fast. Security was something that happened elsewhere, on firewalls, inside WAFs or deep in the application code.

That perspective changed early in my consulting career.

I worked with a customer who had invested heavily in security tools like firewalls, endpoint protection and a WAF buried deep in the stack. The technology was solid. The problem wasn’t the tools; it was the architecture. At the edge, the load balancer was treated purely as a performance device, tuned only for speed. Security policies such as strict TLS enforcement, request hygiene, and basic abuse controls were pushed to later phases.

The attacker didn’t break our tools. They simply walked through the open path our design had left behind. Nothing failed technically. The architecture failed.

Since then, every architecture I design starts with one principle: Application security begins at the traffic entry point. And in most modern environments, that entry point is the load balancer.

What I saw go wrong in real projects

I’ve worked with banks, healthcare systems, SaaS companies, and retailers. Different industries, same pattern:

Internet traffic hits the load balancer

The load balancer forwards traffic as fast as possible

Security happens later

The problem is simple. If the first system doesn’t enforce trust, everything behind it is already compromised by design.

Example 1: Financial services

The team invested heavily in downstream security tools. But the load balancer accepted weak TLS versions and ciphers because some legacy clients still needed it. Attackers forced connections down to older TLS versions, exploited weak cipher suites, and gained visibility into traffic that should never have been exposed.

Fix: Disable TLS 1.0 and 1.1, enforce strong cipher suites, implement HSTS and OCSP stapling, and prefer TLS 1.3 with modern AEAD ciphers.

Many teams treat TLS configuration at the load balancer as a compatibility setting rather than a security control. In practice, it defines the cryptographic trust boundary for the entire application stack.

NIST’s TLS guidance is especially relevant here because it does not simply list preferred protocols. It explains why older versions introduce unacceptable risk, including downgrade attacks, weak key exchange mechanisms, and deprecated cryptographic primitives. When a load balancer allows legacy TLS for convenience, it creates an attack surface that downstream systems cannot correct.

From an architectural standpoint, enforcing NIST-aligned TLS policies at the load balancer eliminates entire classes of attacks before traffic ever reaches a WAF or application server. It also provides a defensible baseline for audits and regulatory reviews, particularly in financial and healthcare environments where encryption standards are closely scrutinized

Example 2: Retail platform

The site faced massive bot traffic, such as scrapers, credential stuffers, and inventory scalpers. Protections were added inside the application, but the load balancer treated all traffic equally. Automated abuse consumed capacity before deeper security layers even saw it. Legitimate users paid the price.

During peak periods, a large portion of incoming traffic was automated abuse. The business impact was clear: slower pages, failed checkouts, and lost revenue.

What makes the OWASP Automated Threats guide particularly valuable is its focus on scale rather than sophistication. Most automated attacks do not rely on novel exploits. They succeed because they generate high volumes of traffic that look superficially legitimate.

This is where load balancers play a critical role. They see traffic before authentication, before session state, and before business logic is invoked. If every request is forwarded downstream without discrimination, automated abuse can exhaust infrastructure long before application-level controls engage.

By applying rate limits, connection caps, and behavioral thresholds at the load balancer, organizations can disrupt automated attacks at a fraction of the cost.

The turning point: securing the entry layer

Today, when I design systems, the first question I ask isn’t “How fast is it?” but “How much do I trust what enters here?”

I treat the load balancer as a policy enforcement point for encryption, identity, protocol correctness, and abuse prevention. It becomes the first checkpoint in a zero trust path, not just a distributor of packets.

Four key practices at the load balancer

1. Strong encryption and identity at the edge:

Enforce TLS 1.3 where possible

Allow TLS 1.2 only with modern AEAD cipher suites

Disable legacy protocols that enable downgrade attacks

2. Protocol and request sanitation

Normalize and validate traffic before it reaches the app

Reject malformed headers (e.g., duplicate Host headers, invalid characters) and strip hop-by-hop header

3. Bot and abuse control

Implement token bucket rate limiting keyed by IP or session

Detect and block scrapers and credential stuffing early

4. Integration with deeper security layers

The load balancer complements WAF and application security

Enforce transport, identity, and hygiene before semantic inspection

Cloud Security Alliance guidance consistently emphasizes shared responsibility and defense-in-depth.

Why this matters beyond technology

This isn’t just a technical argument, it’s a business one. When applications go down, customers leave. When breaches happen, trust is lost. Both often begin with small design decisions made early in architecture.

A strong edge reduces total cost of ownership by cutting wasted capacity, lowering false positives downstream, and reducing incident response hours.

Why edge security decisions compound over time

Security decisions made at the load balancer tend to compound, for better or worse. A permissive edge may appear harmless at first, especially when applications are small and traffic volumes are manageable. Over time, however, those early choices harden into technical debt.

Allowing weak encryption for compatibility today becomes an exception that must be supported indefinitely. Deferring abuse controls pushes more responsibility onto application teams that are already focused on features and delivery timelines. Pushing request hygiene downstream increases noise for WAFs and intrusion detection systems, leading to alert fatigue and slower incident response.

The opposite is also true. When strong controls are enforced at the entry point, downstream systems benefit immediately. Applications receive cleaner, more predictable traffic. Security tools operate with higher signal and fewer false positives. Infrastructure capacity is preserved for real users instead of being consumed by automated abuse.

This has a measurable business impact. Teams spend less time firefighting performance issues during peak traffic events. Incident response becomes faster because the scope of investigation is smaller. Compliance reviews are easier because baseline controls are consistently enforced at the edge.

Most importantly, a strong entry layer creates architectural flexibility. Applications can evolve, scale, and migrate across environments without redefining security assumptions each time. The load balancer becomes a stable trust boundary, absorbing change while maintaining consistent protection.

These benefits are rarely visible on day one. They become obvious only when something goes wrong, and by then, the quality of the front door determines how much damage occurs.

I used to think application security lived deep inside the stack. Experience taught me otherwise. Every major incident I’ve seen had one thing in common: the attacker entered easily.

That’s why I now say this without hesitation: application security must start at the load balancer. Not because it replaces other controls, but because every system needs a strong front door.

When the front door is strong, everything behind it becomes easier to secure, easier to scale, and easier to trust.

LLMs can supercharge your SOC, but if you don’t fence them in, they’ll open a brand-new attack surface while attackers scale faster.

Large language models (LLMs) have arrived in security in three different forms at once: as productivity tools that sit beside analysts, as components embedded inside products and workflows and as targets that attackers can probe, manipulate and steal.

That convergence is why the conversation feels messy. The same capability that can summarize an incident in seconds can also generate a believable pretext for a spear phish. The same assistant that can draft detection logic can also be induced to leak sensitive context if it is wired into internal knowledge bases without guardrails.

I treat LLMs as another high-impact system: define outcomes, model threats and build controls that assume the model will be wrong or manipulated.

How LLMs are changing the work of security teams

When people say “LLMs in the SOC,” they often picture a chat interface. The more meaningful shift is architectural: LLMs make it cheap to translate unstructured security data into structured hypotheses, narratives and next steps. That matters because a large share of security work is not technically difficult. It is context stitching.

If I were rolling out an LLM capability inside a security program, I would start with a narrow set of workflows where the output is advisory and easy to verify. Then I would expand only after the team can measure quality and manage failure modes.

Here are high-value use cases that are well-suited to early adoption:

Alert triage summaries that turn raw telemetry into a short “what happened, why it matters and what I should check next” narrative

Investigation copilots that generate a timeline from logs, tickets and chat transcripts, then highlight gaps and recommended pivots

Detection engineering assistance for drafting Sigma, YARA or query language snippets that an engineer can review and test

Vulnerability management copilots that cluster similar findings, explain exploitability in business terms and propose patch windows

Policy and standards Q&A, where the assistant answers questions by citing the exact internal control language it relied on

Even in these safe scenarios, the operating rule I use is simple: treat the LLM output as untrusted. If a model is allowed to write code, recommend a containment action or reference internal data, you should assume it can hallucinate, be socially engineered or be prompted into unsafe behavior.

The OWASP community has cataloged common failure modes for LLM-enabled applications, including prompt injection, insecure output handling, sensitive information disclosure, excessive agency and overreliance. Those are not academic concepts. They map directly to the ways LLMs fail in security workflows. See OWASP Top 10 for LLM applications.

Practically, I think of an LLM deployment in security as three layers: the model, the data it can see and the actions it can take. You can get significant value by widening the first layer (e.g., by using better models or prompts) while keeping the other two layers constrained.

Three design choices consistently reduce risk without killing value:

Make sources explicit: Use retrieval-augmented generation so the assistant answers from curated documents, tickets or playbooks and show the cited snippets to the analyst.

Keep the model out of the blast radius: The model should not hold secrets. Use short-lived credentials, scoped tokens and brokered access to tools.

Gate actions: Anything that changes a system state (blocking, quarantining, deleting, emailing) should require human approval or a separate policy engine.

Leadership still needs to be clear-eyed about measurement. If you cannot quantify whether the assistant reduces response time or improves signal quality, you are taking on a new class of operational risk for uncertain gain.

How attackers are using the same capability to scale and personalize

Defenders are not the only ones automating context stitching. Attackers can use LLMs to do reconnaissance, craft language and iterate quickly. The result is not new attacks so much as a change in the economics of attackers: cheaper personalization, faster iteration and fewer language barriers.

The most immediate impact is in social engineering. A good phishing email is not just about correct grammar. It is situational relevance: the right tone, the right internal jargon and the right moment in a business process. LLMs make that kind of tailoring trivial at scale.

A 2024 study by Heiding, Lermen, Kao, Schneier and Vishwanath evaluated fully automated spear phishing campaigns validated on human subjects. In their experiment, AI-generated emails performed on par with human experts and far better than a generic phishing control group. The paper is worth reading in full because it quantifies the problem and makes the attacker economics tangible.

At the same time, organizations are creating a new set of soft targets by wiring LLMs into internal knowledge bases, ticketing systems and workflow tools. If an attacker can induce prompt injection through a user-controlled input, a document in a shared repository or a compromised web page that the assistant is allowed to read, the model can become a conduit for data leakage or unsafe actions.

That is why I treat LLM security as both an offensive and defensive discipline. You are defending your organization from LLM-enabled threats and you are defending your own LLM-enabled systems from being turned against you. The UK Department for Science, Innovation and Technology has mapped vulnerabilities across the AI lifecycle from design through maintenance, which is a useful mental model for security teams.

To keep it actionable, I group attacker opportunities into three buckets:

LLMs as persuasion engines: better pretexts, better multilingual scams, better impersonation and better fraud scripting

LLMs as productivity engines: faster iteration on commodity malware, scripts, recon reports and exploit adaptation

LLMs as targets and pivots: stealing prompts, extracting system instructions, poisoning data sources or manipulating tool-using agents

The defensive implication is uncomfortable: some of your existing controls matter more than ever, especially verification, identity proofing and process hardening. If an executive approval workflow can be bypassed with a convincing message, an LLM will help attackers find and exploit that weakness faster.

LLMs also complicate content-based detection. When attackers can generate clean language, I put more weight on technical and behavioral signals (sender authentication, unusual login, anomalous payment request pattern) than on tone or grammar cues.

A control stack that lets you use LLMs without losing the plot

I do not think organizations need a brand-new governance regime for LLMs. They need to apply existing governance muscle to new failure modes. The closest fit is risk management, not model worship.

A helpful anchor is the NIST Artificial Intelligence Risk Management Framework, which organizes activities into govern, map, measure and manage. The value is less in the labels and more in the discipline: define accountability, understand context and impacts, measure risk and then operationalize mitigations.

If I were advising a security and risk committee on an LLM program, I would propose the following control stack. It is intentionally pragmatic and it assumes a mixed environment of third-party models, internal data and tool integrations:

Govern: Define what the model is allowed to do, who owns it and what unsafe means in your context (data classes, regulated workflows, critical decisions)

Map: Document the end-to-end system, including prompts, data sources, retrieval pipelines, plugins and downstream actions; not just the model endpoint

Secure the data: Inventory training, fine-tuning and retrieval corpora, enforce access controls and monitor for poisoning, leakage and unauthorized reuse

Threat model with AI-specific techniques: Map likely adversary behaviors using MITRE ATLAS and include prompt injection and tool abuse in your scenarios

Build guardrails at the boundaries: Input validation, content filtering, output constraints and schema-based parsing for any output that feeds automation

Gate high-impact actions: Require explicit approvals, step-up authentication or policy engine checks before an agent can change state in production

Test like you mean it: Red-team the assistant, run jailbreak and prompt injection suites and measure error rates under realistic loads

Instrument, monitor and respond: Log prompts, tool calls and outputs, detect anomalous usage patterns and maintain a kill switch for unsafe automation

Two pieces of public guidance are worth reading because they translate secure AI into operational steps. First, “Guidelines for secure AI system development” — a document published by UK National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) — provides lifecycle guidance from secure design through secure operation and maintenance. Second, “Deploying AI systems securely” — published jointly by the US National Security Agency’s Artificial Intelligence Security Center (AISC) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), along with other national and international agencies — focuses on best practices for deploying and operating externally developed AI systems.

Finally, I treat excessive agency as a line you cross deliberately. The more autonomy you give an LLM-based agent, the more you are building a new class of privileged software. If you would not give a junior script unfettered API access, you should not give it to a probabilistic model either.

The convergence of LLMs and cybersecurity is not optional. Attackers will use these tools and employees already are. The advantage comes from capturing productivity gains while keeping control of data, identity and change management.

[42] CSO Online - Ransomware groups switch to stealthy attacks and long-term access
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Attackers are shifting from smash-and-grab operations to “parasitic” residency. CISOs must emphasize identity controls, monitor trusted applications and integrations, and focused detection strategies on persistence.

Ransomware attackers are switching tactics in favor of more stealthy infiltration, as the threat of public exposure of sensitive corporate data is becoming the main mechanism of extortion.

Picus Security’s annual red-teaming report shows attackers shifting away from loud disruption toward quiet, long-term access — or from “predatory” smash-and-grab tactics to “parasitic” silent residency.

Four in five of the most common attack techniques deployed by ransomware strains are designed to stay hidden once attackers gain initial access. For example, ransomware operations are increasingly using defense evasion and persistence techniques as their tradecraft has evolved, according to Picus Security, a cybersecurity firm that specializes in breach and attack simulation.

Attackers are also increasingly routing command-and-control (C2) traffic through trusted enterprise services such as OpenAI and AWS so that malign activity more closely resembles normal business traffic.

Picus Security’s conclusions come from attack simulations combined with an analysis of 1.1 million malicious files and 15.5 million adversarial actions mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

The Picus findings about attackers favoring stealth and persistence over loud disruption are consistent with the findings of ransomware research by Securin, which reports that attackers are chaining vulnerabilities in their attacks on corporate systems.

“Ransomware groups no longer treat vulnerabilities as isolated entry points,” says Aviral Verma, lead threat intelligence analyst at penetration testing and cybersecurity services firm Securin. “They assemble them into deliberate exploitation chains, selecting weaknesses not just for severity, but for how effectively they can collapse trust, persistence, and operational control across entire platforms.”

AI is now widely accessible to threat actors, but it primarily functions as a force multiplier rather than a driving force in ransomware attacks.

Ransomware gangs commonly favor double extortion where blackmail based on the threatened leak of stolen information is combined by the disruption caused by encrypting data after breaking into corporate networks.

Picus reports a 38% drop in encryption over the past 12 months as more cybercriminals turn to silently exfiltrating data for extortion as their main stock in trade.

Picus’ suggestion that the volume of ransomware attacks is dropping is disputed by other experts.

Tony Anscombe, chief security evangelist at endpoint security vendor Eset, offered a contrasting perspective.

“In the recent Eset H2 2025 Threat Report, the detection data shows a 13% increase between H1 and H2, coupled with the number of publicly reported victims increasing by 40% reported via ecrime.ch, then it [ransomware] does not appear to be in decline,” Anscombe tells CSO.

Nick Hyatt, senior threat intelligence consultant at cybersecurity services firm GuidePoint Security, says the data of more than 7,000 victims was publicly posted last year, a figure that likely excludes “victims who paid and were never posted by the threat actor.”

Far from showing any signs of consolidation, the number of active ransomware groups hit an all-time high last year, according to GuidePoint.

“Threat actors streamlined their attack capabilities, using a mix of established techniques, vulnerability exploitation, and novel attacks to execute on their objectives,” says Hyatt.

Experts polled by CSO commonly rated Qilin, Cl0p and Akira as among the most active ransomware groups but there was no shortage of other contenders.

“Akira stands out as the No. 1 ransomware group today from Huntress’ 2025 data,” says Dray Agha, senior manager of security operations at managed detection and response firm Huntress. “Their tradecraft is rapidly evolving specifically to neutralize existing security solutions, and we are seeing them aggressively target the hypervisor level to completely bypass traditional endpoint security protections.”

Collin Hogue-Spears, senior director distinguished technical expert at application security firm Black Duck Software, says that ransomware operators have stopped operating like organized crime and started operating like a platform business.

“Qilin posted over 1,000 victims in 2025, a seven-fold increase over the prior year,” according to Hogue-Spears. “LockBit 5.0 clawed back to operational capacity after its takedown.”

Meanwhile the Scattered Spider/Lapsus$/ShinyHunters (SLSH) federation is running extortion-as-a-service, an approach that makes it easier for less technically skilled cybercriminals to make a dishonest living.

SLSH has created a “structural shift” in the cybercrime ecosystem.

“Seventy-three new groups appeared in six months because they no longer need to build their own tooling,” says Hogue-Spears. “They rent it.”

New threat techniques require security rethink

Vasileios Mourtzinos, a member of the threat team at managed detection and response firm Quorum Cyber, says that more groups are moving away from high-impact encryption towards extortion-led models that prioritize data theft and prolonged, low-noise access.

“This approach, popularized by actors such as Cl0p through large-scale exploitation of third-party and supply chain vulnerabilities, is now being mirrored more widely, alongside increased abuse of valid accounts, legitimate administrative tools to blend into normal activity, and in some cases attempts to recruit or incentivize insiders to facilitate access,” Mourtzinos says.

The evolving tradecraft of ransomware groups should prompt a rethink of defensive strategies.

“For CISOs, the priority should be strengthening identity controls, closely monitoring trusted applications and third-party integrations, and ensuring detection strategies focus on persistence and data exfiltration activity,” Mourtzinos advises.
