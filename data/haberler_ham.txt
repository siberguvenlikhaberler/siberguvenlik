[TAM METİN - 701 kelime]
Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed details of a new Android trojan called Massiv that's designed to facilitate device takeover (DTO) attacks for financial theft.

The malware, according to ThreatFabric, masquerades as seemingly harmless IPTV apps to deceive victims, indicating that the activity is primarily singling out users looking for the online TV applications.

"This new threat, while only seen in a limited number of rather targeted campaigns, already poses a great risk to the users of mobile banking, allowing its operators to remotely control infected devices and perform device takeover attacks with further fraudulent transactions performed from the victim's banking accounts," the Dutch mobile security company said in a report shared with The Hacker News.

Like various Android banking malware families, Massiv supports a wide range of features to facilitate credential theft through a number of methods: screen streaming through Android's MediaProjection API, keylogging, SMS interception, and fake overlays served atop banking and financial apps. The overlay asks users to enter their credentials and credit card details.

One such campaign has been found to target gov.pt, a Portuguese public administration app that allows users to store identification documents and manage the Digital Mobile Key (aka Chave Móvel Digital or CMD). The overlay tricks users into entering their phone number and PIN code, likely in an effort to bypass Know Your Customer (KYC) verification.

ThreatFabric said it identified cases where scammers used the information captured through these overlays to open new banking accounts in the victim's name, allowing them to be used for money laundering or getting loans approved without the actual victim's knowledge.

In addition, it serves as a fully functional remote-control tool, granting the operator the ability to access the victim's device stealthily while showing a black screen overlay to conceal the malicious activity. These techniques, realized by abusing Android's accessibility services, have also been observed in several other Android bankers like Crocodilus, Datzbro, and Klopatra.

"However, some applications implement protection against screen capture," the company explained. "To bypass it, Massiv uses so-called UI-tree mode -- it traverses AccessibilityWindowInfo roots and recursively processes AccessibilityNodeInfo objects."

This is done so as to build a JSON representation of visible text and content descriptions, UI elements, screen coordinates, and interaction flags that indicate whether the UI element is clickable, editable, focused, or enabled. Only nodes that are visible and have text are exported to the attacker, who can then determine the next course of action by issuing specific commands to interact with the device.

The malware is equipped to carry out a wide range of malicious actions -

Enable black overlay, mute sounds and vibration

Send device information

Perform click and swipe actions

Alter clipboard with specific text

Turn on/off screen streaming

Unlock device with pattern

Serve overlays for an app, device pattern lock, or PIN

Download ZIP archive with overlays for targeted applications

Download and install APK files

Open Battery Optimization, Device Admin, and Play Protect settings screens

Rquest for permissions to access SMS messages, install APK packages,

Clear log databases on the device

Massiv is distributed in the form of dropper apps mimicking IPTV apps via SMS phishing. Once installed and launched, the dropper prompts the victim to install an "important" update by granting it permissions to install software from external sources. The names of the malicious artifacts are listed below -

IPTV24 (hfgx.mqfy.fejku) - Dropper

Google Play (hobfjp.anrxf.cucm) - Massiv

"In most of the cases observed, it is just masquerading," ThreatFabric said. "No actual IPTV applications were infected or initially contained malicious code. Usually, the dropper that mimics an IPTV app opens a WebView with an IPTV website in it, while the actual malware is already installed and running on the device."

The majority of Android malware campaigns using TV-related droppers have targeted Spain, Portugal, France, and Turkey over the past six months.

Massiv is the latest entrant to an already crowded Android threat landscape, reflecting the continuing demand for such turnkey solutions among cybercriminals.

"While not yet observed being promoted as Malware-as-a-Service, Massiv's operator shows clear signs of going this path, introducing API keys to be used in malware communication with the backend," ThreatFabric said. "Code analysis revealed ongoing development, with more features likely to be introduced in the future."

[2] The Hacker News - CRESCENTHARVEST Campaign Targets Iran Protest Supporters With RAT Malware
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[TAM METİN - 945 kelime]
Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed details of a new campaign dubbed CRESCENTHARVEST, likely targeting supporters of Iran's ongoing protests to conduct information theft and long-term espionage.

The Acronis Threat Research Unit (TRU) said it observed the activity after January 9, with the attacks designed to deliver a malicious payload that serves as a remote access trojan (RAT) and information stealer to execute commands, log keystrokes, and exfiltrate sensitive data. It's currently not known if any of the attacks were successful.

"The campaign exploits recent geopolitical developments to lure victims into opening malicious .LNK files disguised as protest-related images or videos," researchers Subhajeet Singha, Eliad Kimhy, and Darrel Virtusio said in a report published this week.

"These files are bundled with authentic media and a Farsi-language report providing updates from 'the rebellious cities of Iran.' This pro- protest framing appears to be intended to increase credibility and to attract Farsi-speaking Iranians seeking protest-related information."

CRESCENTHARVEST, although unattributed, is believed to be the work of an Iran-aligned threat group. The discovery makes it the second such campaign identified as going after specific individuals in the aftermath of the nationwide protests in Iran that began towards the end of 2025.

Last month, French cybersecurity company HarfangLab detailed a threat cluster dubbed RedKitten that targeted non-governmental organizations and individuals involved in documenting recent human rights abuses in Iran with an aim to infect them with a custom backdoor known as SloppyMIO.

According to Acronis, the exact initial access vector used to distribute the malware is not known. However, it's suspected that the threat actors are relying on spear-phishing or "protracted social engineering efforts" in which the operators build rapport with the victims over time before sending the malicious payloads.

It's worth noting that Iranian hacking groups like Charming Kitten and Tortoiseshell have a storied history of engaging in sophisticated social-engineered attacks that involve approaching prospective targets under fake personas and cultivating a relationship with them, in some cases even stretching for years, before weaponizing the trust to infect them with malware.

"The use of Farsi language content for social engineering and the distributed files depicting the protests in heroic terms suggest an intent to attract Farsi-speaking individuals of Iranian origin, who are in support of the ongoing protests," the Swiss-based security company noted.

The starting point of the attack chain is a malicious RAR archive that claims to contain information related to the Iranian protests, including various images and videos, along with two Windows shortcut (LNK) files that masquerade as an image or a video file by using the double extension trick (*.jpg.lnk or *.mp4.lnk).

The deceptive file, once launched, contains PowerShell code to retrieve another ZIP archive, while simultaneously opening a harmless image or video, tricking the victim into thinking that they have interacted with a benign file.

Present within the ZIP archive is a legitimate Google-signed binary ("software_reporter_tool.exe") shipped as part of Chrome's cleanup utility and several DLL files, including two rogue libraries that are sideloaded by the executable to realize the threat actor's objectives -

urtcbased140d_d.dll, a C++ implant that extracts and decrypts Chrome's app-bound encryption keys through COM interfaces. It shares overlaps with an open-source project known as ChromElevator.

version.dll (aka CRESCENTHARVEST), a remote access tool that lists installed antivirus products and security tools, enumerates local user accounts on the device, loads DLLs, harvests system metadata, browser credentials, Telegram desktop account data, and keystrokes.

CRESCENTHARVEST employs Windows Win HTTP APIs to communicate with its command-and-control (C2) server ("servicelog-information[.]com"), allowing it to blend in with regular traffic. Some of the supported commands are listed below -

Anti, to run anti-analysis checks

His, to steal browser history

Dir, to list directories

Cwd, to get the current working directory

Cd, to change directory

GetUser, to get user information

ps, to run PowerShell commands (not working)

KeyLog, to activate keylogger

Tel_s, to steal Telegram session data

Info, to steal system information

F_log, to steal browser credentials

Upload, to upload files

shell, to run shell commands

"The CRESCENTHARVEST campaign represents the latest chapter in a decade-long pattern of suspected nation-state cyber espionage operations targeting journalists, activists, researchers, and diaspora communities globally," Acronis said. "Much of what we observed in CRESCENTHARVEST reflects well-established tradecraft: LNK-based initial access, DLL side-loading through signed binaries, credential harvesting and social engineering aligned to current events."

The disclosure comes days after The New York Times revealed that Iran's government likely tracked protesters' locations through their phones to warn them over a text message that their "presence at illegal gatherings" had been recorded and that they were under "intelligence monitoring."

The move, it said, was an attempt to crack down dissent. According to a report published by Iran-focused digital rights group Holistic Resilience last week, some people who posted on social media about the protests and other political topics have had their SIM cards suspended.

"The Islamic Republic is building a distinct model of digital control and surveillance, one that is not based on permanent isolation but on conditional and interruptible connectivity," RaazNet said.

"The central pillar of this model is the National Information Network (NIN). Unlike traditional physical infrastructure, such as roads or factories, the NIN is not a static state project. Like other digital systems, it evolves continuously alongside advances in communications technologies, undergoes regular versioning, and is expanded in response to changing technical and political requirements."

The move is part of a broader effort that combines information gleaned from e-government databases, surveillance cameras, as well as malware deployed via social engineering to establish remote access and monitor its citizens' movements online in a sustained manner. One such tool is a lightweight modular trojan called 2Ac2 RAT that's designed for victim device control and data collection.

[3] The Hacker News - Citizen Lab Finds Cellebrite Tool Used on Kenyan Activist’s Phone in Police Custody
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Wed, 18 Feb 2026 23:00:00 +0530
Link: https://thehackernews.com/2026/02/citizen-lab-finds-cellebrite-tool-used.html

[TAM METİN - 730 kelime]
New research from the Citizen Lab has found signs that Kenyan authorities used a commercial forensic extraction tool manufactured by Israeli company Cellebrite to break into a prominent dissident's phone, making it the latest case of abuse of the technology targeting civil society.

The interdisciplinary research unit at the University of Toronto's Munk School of Global Affairs & Public Policy said it found the indicators on a personal phone belonging to Boniface Mwangi, a Kenyan pro-democracy activist who has announced plans to run for president in 2027.

Specifically, it has emerged that Cellebrite's forensic extraction tools were used on his Samsung phone while it was in police custody following his arrest in July 2025.

The phone was returned to him nearly two months later, in September, at which point Mwangi found that the phone was no longer password-protected and could be unlocked without requiring a password. It's been assessed with high confidence that Cellebrite's technology was used on the phone on or around July 20 and July 21, 2025.

"The use of Cellebrite could have enabled the full extraction of all materials from Mwangi's device, including messages, private materials, personal files, financial information, passwords, and other sensitive information," the Citizen Lab said.

The latest findings follow a separate report released last month, in which the researchers said officials in Jordan likely used Cellebrite to extract information from the mobile phones of activists and human rights defenders who had been critical of Israel and spoke out in support of Palestinians in Gaza.

The devices were seized by Jordanian authorities during detentions, arrests, and interrogations, and subsequently returned to them. The documented incidents took place between late 2023 and mid-2025, the Citizen Lab said.

In response to the findings, a spokesperson for Cellebrite told The Guardian that the company's technology is used to "access private data only in accordance with legal due process or with appropriate consent to aid investigations legally after an event has occurred."

The two cases add to a growing body of evidence documenting the misuse of Cellebrite technology by government clients. It also reflects a broader ecosystem of surveillance abuses by various governments around the world to enable highly-targeted surveillance using mercenary spyware like Pegasus and Predator.

Predator Spyware Targets Angolan Journalist

The development also coincides with another report from Amnesty International, which discovered evidence that the iPhone belonging to Teixeira Cândido, an Angolan journalist and press freedom advocate, was successfully targeted by Intellexa's Predator spyware in May 2024 after he opened an infection link received via WhatsApp.

The iPhone was running iOS 16.2, an outdated version of the operating system with known security issues. It's currently not known what exploit was used to trigger the infection. In multiple reports published last year, Recorded Future revealed that it has observed suspected Predator operations in Angola dating back to 2024.

"This is the first forensically confirmed case of the Predator spyware being used to target civil society in Angola," the international human rights organization said. "Once the spyware was installed, the attacker could gain unrestricted access to Teixeira Cândido's iPhone."

"The Predator spyware infection appears to have lasted less than one day, with the infection being removed when Teixeira Cândido's phone was restarted in the evening of 4 May 2024. From that time until 16 June 2024, the attackers made 11 new attempts to re-infect the device by sending him new malicious Predator infection links. All of these subsequent attack attempts appear to have failed, likely due to the links simply not being opened."

According to an analysis published by French offensive security company Reverse Society, Predator is a commercial spyware product "built for reliable, long-term deployment" and allows operators to selectively enable or disable modules based on target activity, granting them real-time control over surveillance efforts.

Predator has also been found to incorporate various undocumented anti-analysis mechanisms, including a crash reporter monitoring system for anti-forensics and SpringBoard hooking to suppress recording indicators from victims when the microphone or camera is activated, illustrating the sophistication of the spyware. On top of that, it has explicit checks to avoid running in U.S. and Israeli locales.

"These findings demonstrate that Predator's operators have granular visibility into failed deployments, [...] enabling them to adapt their approaches for specific targets," Jamf Threat Labs researchers Shen Yuan and Nir Avraham said. "This error code system transforms failed deployments from black boxes into diagnostic events."

[4] The Hacker News - Grandstream GXP1600 VoIP Phones Exposed to Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Wed, 18 Feb 2026 22:05:00 +0530
Link: https://thehackernews.com/2026/02/grandstream-gxp1600-voip-phones-exposed.html

[TAM METİN - 448 kelime]
Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed a critical security flaw in the Grandstream GXP1600 series of VoIP phones that could allow an attacker to seize control of susceptible devices.

The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2026-2329, carries a CVSS score of 9.3 out of a maximum of 10.0. It has been described as a case of unauthenticated stack-based buffer overflow that could result in remote code execution.

"A remote attacker can leverage CVE-2026-2329 to achieve unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) with root privileges on a target device," Rapid7 researcher Stephen Fewer, who discovered and reported the bug on January 6, 2026, said.

According to the cybersecurity company, the issue is rooted in the device's web-based API service ("/cgi-bin/api.values.get") and is accessible in a default configuration without requiring authentication.

This endpoint is designed to fetch one or more configuration values from the phone, such as the firmware version number or the model, through a colon-delimited string in the "request" parameter (e.g., "request=68:phone_model"), which is then parsed to extract each identifier and append it to a 64 byte buffer on the stack.

"When appending another character to the small 64 byte buffer, no length check is performed to ensure that no more than 63 characters (plus the appended null terminator) are ever written to this buffer," Fewer explained. "Therefore, an attacker-controlled 'request' parameter can write past the bounds of the small 64 byte buffer on the stack, overflowing into adjacent stack memory."

This means that a malicious colon-delimited "request" parameter sent as part of an HTTP request to the "/cgi-bin/api.values.get" endpoint can be used to trigger a stack-based buffer overflow, allowing the threat actors to corrupt the stack contents and ultimately achieve remote code execution on the underlying operating system.

The vulnerability affects GXP1610, GXP1615, GXP1620, GXP1625, GXP1628, and GXP1630 models. It has been addressed as part of a firmware update (version 1.0.7.81) released late last month.

In a Metasploit exploit module developed by Rapid7, it has been demonstrated that the vulnerability could be exploited to gain root privileges on a vulnerable device and chain it with a post-exploitation component to extract credentials stored on a compromised device.

Furthermore, the remote code execution capabilities can be weaponized to reconfigure the target device to use a malicious Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) proxy, effectively enabling the attacker to intercept phone calls to and from the device and eavesdrop on VoIP conversations. A SIP proxy is an intermediary server in VoIP networks to establish and manage voice/video calls between endpoints.

"This isn't a one-click exploit with fireworks and a victory banner," Rapid7's Douglas McKee said. "But the underlying vulnerability lowers the barrier in a way that should concern anyone operating these devices in exposed or lightly-segmented environments."

[5] The Hacker News - Critical Flaws Found in Four VS Code Extensions with Over 125 Million Installs
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Wed, 18 Feb 2026 18:46:00 +0530
Link: https://thehackernews.com/2026/02/critical-flaws-found-in-four-vs-code.html

[TAM METİN - 403 kelime]
Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed multiple security vulnerabilities in four popular Microsoft Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extensions that, if successfully exploited, could allow threat actors to steal local files and execute code remotely.

The extensions, which have been collectively installed more than 125 million times, are Live Server, Code Runner, Markdown Preview Enhanced, and Microsoft Live Preview.

"Our research demonstrates that a hacker needs only one malicious extension, or a single vulnerability within one extension, to perform lateral movement and compromise entire organizations," OX Security researchers Moshe Siman Tov Bustan and Nir Zadok said in a report shared with The Hacker News.

Details of the vulnerabilities are as follows -

CVE-2025-65717 (CVSS score: 9.1) - A vulnerability in Live Server that allows attackers to exfiltrate local files, tricking a developer into visiting a malicious website when the extension is running, causing JavaScript embedded in the page to crawl and extract files from the local development HTTP server that runs at localhost:5500, and transmit them to a domain under their control. (Remains unpatched)

CVE-2025-65716 (CVSS score: 8.8) - A vulnerability in Markdown Preview Enhanced that allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code by uploading a crafted markdown (.md) file, allowing local port enumeration and exfiltration to a domain under their control. (Remains unpatched)

CVE-2025-65715 (CVSS score: 7.8) - A vulnerability in Code Runner that allows attackers to execute arbitrary code by convincing a user to alter the "settings.json" file through phishing or social engineering. (Remains unpatched)

A vulnerability in Microsoft Live Preview allows attackers to access sensitive files on a developer's machine by tricking a victim into visiting a malicious website when the extension is running, which then enables specially crafted JavaScript requests targeting the localhost to enumerate and exfiltrate sensitive files. (No CVE, Fixed silently by Microsoft in version 0.4.16 released in September 2025)

To secure the development environment, it's essential to avoid applying untrusted configurations, disable or uninstall non-essential extensions, harden the local network behind a firewall to restrict inbound and outbound connections, periodically update extensions, and turn off localhost-based services when not in use.

"Poorly written extensions, overly permissive extensions, or malicious ones can execute code, modify files, and allow attackers to take over a machine and exfiltrate information," OX Security said. "Keeping vulnerable extensions installed on a machine is an immediate threat to an organization's security posture: it may take only one click, or a downloaded repository, to compromise everything."

[6] The Hacker News - Cybersecurity Tech Predictions for 2026: Operating in a World of Permanent Instability
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Wed, 18 Feb 2026 17:28:00 +0530
Link: https://thehackernews.com/2026/02/cybersecurity-tech-predictions-for-2026.html

[TAM METİN - 1765 kelime]
In 2025, navigating the digital seas still felt like a matter of direction. Organizations charted routes, watched the horizon, and adjusted course to reach safe harbors of resilience, trust, and compliance.

In 2026, the seas are no longer calm between storms. Cybersecurity now unfolds in a state of continuous atmospheric instability: AI-driven threats that adapt in real time, expanding digital ecosystems, fragile trust relationships, persistent regulatory pressure, and accelerating technological change. This is not turbulence on the way to stability; it is the climate.

In this environment, cybersecurity technologies are no longer merely navigational aids. They are structural reinforcements. They determine whether an organization endures volatility or learns to function normally within it. That is why security investments in 2026 are increasingly made not for coverage, but for operational continuity: sustained operations, decision-grade visibility and controlled adaptation as conditions shift.

This article is less about what’s “next-gen” and more about what becomes non-negotiable when conditions keep changing. The shifts that will steer cybersecurity priorities and determine which investments hold when conditions turn.

Regulation and geopolitics become architectural constraints

Regulation is no longer something security reacts to. It is something systems are built to withstand continuously.

Cybersecurity is now firmly anchored at the intersection of technology, regulation and geopolitics. Privacy laws, digital sovereignty requirements, AI governance frameworks and sector-specific regulations no longer sit on the side as periodic compliance work; they operate as permanent design parameters, shaping where data can live, how it can be processed and what security controls are acceptable by default.

At the same time, geopolitical tensions increasingly translate into cyber pressure: supply-chain exposure, jurisdictional risk, sanctions regimes and state-aligned cyber activity all shape the threat landscape as much as vulnerabilities do.

As a result, cybersecurity strategies must integrate regulatory and geopolitical considerations directly into architecture and technology decisions, rather than treating them as parallel governance concerns.

Changing the conditions: Making the attack surface unreliable

Traditional cybersecurity often tried to forecast specific events: the next exploit, the next malware campaign, the next breach. But in an environment where signals multiply, timelines compress and AI blurs intent and scale, those forecasts decay quickly. The problem isn’t that prediction is useless. It’s that it expires faster than defenders can operationalize it.

So the advantage shifts. Instead of trying to guess the next move, the stronger strategy is to shape the conditions attackers need to succeed.

Attackers depend on stability: time to map systems, test assumptions, gather intelligence and establish persistence. The modern counter-move is to make that intelligence unreliable and short-lived. By using tools like Automated Moving Target Defense (AMTD) to dynamically alter system and network parameters, Advanced Cyber Deception that diverts adversaries away from critical systems, or Continuous Threat Exposure Management (CTEM) to map exposure and reduce exploitability, defenders shrink the window in which an intrusion chain can be assembled.

This is where security becomes less about “detect and respond” and more about deny, deceive and disrupt before an attacker’s plan becomes momentum.

The goal is simple: shorten the shelf-life of attacker knowledge until planning becomes fragile, persistence becomes expensive and “low-and-slow” stops paying off.

AI becomes the acceleration layer of the cyber control plane

AI is no longer a feature layered on top of security tools. It is increasingly infused inside them across prevention, detection, response, posture management and governance.

The practical shift is not “more alerts,” but less friction: faster correlation, better prioritization and shorter paths from raw telemetry to usable decisions.

The SOC becomes less of an alert factory and more of a decision engine, with AI accelerating triage, enrichment, correlation and the translation of scattered signals into a coherent narrative. Investigation time compresses because context arrives faster and response becomes more orchestrated because routine steps can be drafted, sequenced and executed with far less manual stitching.

But the bigger story is what happens outside the SOC. AI is increasingly used to improve the efficiency and quality of cybersecurity controls: asset and data discovery become faster and more accurate; posture management becomes more continuous and less audit-driven; policy and governance work becomes easier to standardize and maintain. Identity operations, in particular, benefit from AI-assisted workflows that improve provisioning hygiene, strengthen recertification by focusing reviews on meaningful risk and reduce audit burden by accelerating evidence collection and anomaly detection.

This is the shift that matters. Security programs stop spending energy assembling complexity and start spending it steering outcomes.

Security becomes a lifecycle discipline across digital ecosystems

Most breaches do not start with a vulnerability. They start with an architectural decision made months earlier.

Cloud platforms, SaaS ecosystems, APIs, identity federation and AI services continue to expand digital environments at a faster rate than traditional security models can absorb. The key shift is not merely that the attack surface grows, but that interconnectedness changes what “risk” means.

Security is therefore becoming a lifecycle discipline: integrated throughout the entire system lifecycle, not just development. It starts at architecture and procurement, continues through integration and configuration, extends into operations and change management and is proven during incidents and recovery.

In practice, that means the lifecycle now includes what modern ecosystems are actually made of: secure-by-design delivery through the SDLC and digital supply chain security to manage the risks inherited from third-party software, cloud services and dependencies.

Leading organizations move away from security models focused on isolated components or single phases. Instead, security is increasingly designed as an end-to-end capability that evolves with the system, rather than trying to bolt on controls after the fact.

Zero Trust as a continuous decisioning and adaptive control

In a world where the perimeter dissolved long ago, Zero Trust stops being a strategy and becomes the default infrastructure. Especially as trust itself becomes dynamic.

The key shift is that access is no longer treated as a one-time gate. Zero Trust increasingly means continuous decisioning: permission is evaluated repeatedly, not granted once. Identity, device posture, session risk, behavior and context become live inputs into decisions that can tighten, step up, or revoke access as conditions change.

With identity designed as a dynamic control plane, Zero Trust expands beyond users to include non-human identities such as service accounts, workload identities, API tokens and OAuth grants. This is why identity threat detection and response becomes essential: detecting token abuse, suspicious session behavior and privilege path anomalies early, then containing them fast. Continuous authorization makes stolen credentials less durable, limits how far compromise can travel and reduces the Time-To-Detection dependency by increasing the Time-To-Usefulness friction for attackers. Segmentation then does the other half of the job by keeping local compromise from turning into systemic spread by containing the blast radius by design.

The most mature Zero Trust programs stop measuring success by deployment milestones and start measuring it by operational outcomes: how quickly access can be constrained when risk rises, how fast sessions can be invalidated, how small the blast radius remains when an identity is compromised and how reliably sensitive actions require stronger proof than routine access.

Data security and privacy engineering unlock scalable AI

Data is the foundation of digital value and simultaneously the fastest path to regulatory, ethical and reputational damage. That tension is why data security and privacy engineering are becoming non-negotiable foundations, not governance add-ons. When organizations can’t answer basic questions such as what data exists, where it lives, who can access it, what is it used for and how it moves, every initiative built on data becomes fragile. This is what ultimately determines whether AI projects can scale without turning into a liability.

Data security programs must evolve from “protect what we can see” to govern how the business actually uses data. That means building durable foundations around visibility (discovery, classification, lineage), ownership, enforceable access and retention rules and protections that follow data across cloud, SaaS, platforms and partners. A practical way to build this capability is through a Data Security Maturity Model to identify gaps across the core building blocks, prioritize what to strengthen first and initiate a maturity journey toward consistent, measurable and continuous data protection throughout its lifecycle.

Privacy engineering becomes also the discipline that makes those foundations usable and scalable. It shifts privacy from documentation to design through purpose-based access, minimization by default and privacy-by-design patterns embedded in delivery teams. The result is data that can move quickly with guardrails, without turning growth into hidden liability.

Post-Quantum Risk makes crypto agility a design requirement

Quantum computing is still emerging, but its security impact is already tangible because adversaries plan around time. “Harvest now, decrypt later” turns encrypted traffic collected now into future leverage. “Trust now, forge later” carries the same logic into trust systems: certificates, signed code and long-lived signatures that anchor security decisions today could become vulnerable later.

Governments have understood this timing problem and started to put dates on it, with first milestones as early as 2026 for EU governments and critical infrastructure operators to develop national post-quantum roadmaps and cryptographic inventories. Even if the rules start in the public sector, they travel fast through the supply chain and into the private sector.

This is why crypto agility becomes a design requirement rather than a future upgrade project. Cryptography is not a single control in one place. It is embedded across protocols, applications, identity systems, certificates, hardware, third-party products and cloud services. If an organization cannot rapidly locate where cryptography lives, understand what it protects and change it without breaking operations, it is not “waiting for PQC.” It is accumulating cryptographic debt under a regulatory clock.

Post-quantum preparedness therefore becomes less about picking replacement algorithms and more about building the ability to evolve: cryptographic asset visibility, disciplined key and certificate lifecycle management, upgradable trust anchors where possible and architectures that can rotate algorithms and parameters without disruption.

Cryptographic risk is no longer a future problem. It is a present design decision with long-term consequences.

Taken together, these shifts change what “good” looks like.

Security stops being judged by how much it covers and starts being judged by what it enables: resilience, clarity and controlled adaptation when conditions refuse to cooperate.

The strongest security programs are not the most rigid ones. They are the ones that adapt without losing control.

The digital environment does not promise stability, but it does reward preparation. Organizations that integrate security across the system lifecycle, treat data as a strategic asset, engineer for cryptographic evolution and reduce human friction are better positioned to operate with confidence in a world that keeps shifting.

Turbulence is no longer exceptional. It’s the baseline. The organizations that succeed are the ones designed to operate anyway.

[7] The Hacker News - Dell RecoverPoint for VMs Zero-Day CVE-2026-22769 Exploited Since Mid-2024
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Wed, 18 Feb 2026 16:02:00 +0530
Link: https://thehackernews.com/2026/02/dell-recoverpoint-for-vms-zero-day-cve.html

[TAM METİN - 1030 kelime]
A maximum severity security vulnerability in Dell RecoverPoint for Virtual Machines has been exploited as a zero-day by a suspected China-nexus threat cluster dubbed UNC6201 since mid-2024, according to a new report from Google Mandiant and Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG).

The activity involves the exploitation of CVE-2026-22769 (CVSS score: 10.0), a case of hard-coded credentials affecting versions prior to 6.0.3.1 HF1. Other products, including RecoverPoint Classic, are not vulnerable to the flaw.

"This is considered critical as an unauthenticated remote attacker with knowledge of the hardcoded credential could potentially exploit this vulnerability, leading to unauthorized access to the underlying operating system and root-level persistence," Dell said in a bulletin released Tuesday.

The issue impacts the following products -

RecoverPoint for Virtual Machines Version 5.3 SP4 P1 - Migrate from RecoverPoint for Virtual Machines 5.3 SP4 P1 to 6.0 SP3, and then upgrade to 6.0.3.1 HF1

RecoverPoint for Virtual Machines Versions 6.0, 6.0 SP1, 6.0 SP1 P1, 6.0 SP1 P2, 6.0 SP2, 6.0 SP2 P1, 6.0 SP3, and 6.0 SP3 P1 - Upgrade to 6.0.3.1 HF1

RecoverPoint for Virtual Machines Versions 5.3 SP4, 5.3 SP3, 5.3 SP2, and earlier - Upgrade to version 5.3 SP4 P1 or a 6.x version, and then apply the necessary remediation

"Dell recommends that RecoverPoint for Virtual Machines be deployed within a trusted, access-controlled internal network protected by appropriate firewalls and network segmentation," it noted. "RecoverPoint for Virtual Machines is not intended for use on untrusted or public networks."

"We are aware of less than a dozen impacted organizations, but because the full scale of this campaign is unknown, we recommend that organizations previously targeted by BRICKSTORM look out for GRIMBOLT in their environments," Rich Reece, Manager, Mandiant Consulting at Google Cloud, told The Hacker News via email.

Mandiant said it discovered CVE-2026-22769 earlier this year while investigating multiple Dell RecoverPoint for Virtual Machines within an unspecified victim's environment.

"The actor is likely still active in unpatched and remediated environments, and because exploitation has been occurring since mid-2024, they have had significant time to establish persistence and carry out long-term espionage," Reece said. "We anticipate additional companies will find active or historic compromises as they begin hunting using the new IOCs/YARA rules we published."

Per Google, the hard-coded credential relates to an "admin" user for the Apache Tomcat Manager instance that could be used authenticate to the Dell RecoverPoint Tomcat Manager, upload a web shell named SLAYSTYLE via the "/manager/text/deploy" endpoint, and execute commands as root on the appliance to drop the BRICKSTORM backdoor and its newer version dubbed GRIMBOLT.

"This is a C# backdoor compiled using native ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation, making it harder to reverse engineer," Mandiant's Charles Carmakal added.

Google told The Hacker News that the activity has targeted organizations across North America, with GRIMBOLT incorporating features to better evade detection and minimize forensic traces on infected hosts. "GRIMBOLT is even better at blending in with the system's own native files," it added.

UNC6201 is also assessed to share overlaps with UNC5221, another China-nexus espionage cluster known for its exploitation of virtualization technologies and Ivanti zero-day vulnerabilities to distribute web shells and malware families like BEEFLUSH, BRICKSTORM, and ZIPLINE.

Despite the tactical similarities, the two clusters are assessed to be distinct at this stage. It's worth noting that the use of BRICKSTORM has also been linked by CrowdStrike to a third China-aligned adversary tracked as Warp Panda in attacks aimed at U.S. entities.

A noteworthy aspect of the latest set of attacks revolves around UNC6201's reliance on temporary virtual network interfaces – referred to as "Ghost NICs" – to pivot from compromised virtual machines into internal or SaaS environments, and then delete those NICs to cover up the tracks in an effort to impede investigation efforts.

"Consistent with the earlier BRICKSTORM campaign, UNC6201 continues to target appliances that typically lack traditional endpoint detection and response (EDR) agents to remain undetected for long periods," Google said.

Exactly how initial access is obtained remains unclear, but like UNC5221, it's also known to target edge appliances to break into target networks. An analysis of the compromised VMware vCenter appliances has also uncovered iptable commands executed by means of the web shell to perform the following set of actions -

Monitor incoming traffic on port 443 for a specific HEX string

Add the source IP address of that traffic to a list and if the IP address is on the list and connects to port 10443, the connection is ACCEPTED

Silently redirect subsequent traffic to port 443 to port 10443 for the next 300 seconds (five minutes) if the IP is on the approved list

Furthermore, the threat actor has been found replacing old BRICKSTORM binaries with GRIMBOLT in September 2025. While GRIMBOLT also provides a remote shell capability and uses the same command-and-control (C2) as BRICKSTORM, it's not known what prompted the shift to the harder-to-detect malware, and whether it was a planned transition or a response to public disclosures about BRICKSTORM.

"Nation-state threat actors continue targeting systems that don't commonly support EDR solutions, which makes it very hard for victim organizations to know they are compromised and significantly prolongs intrusion dwell times," Carmakal said.

The disclosure comes as Dragos warned of attacks mounted by Chinese groups like Volt Typhoon (aka Voltzite) to compromise Sierra Wireless Airlink gateways located in electric and oil and gas sectors, followed by pivoting to engineering workstations to dump config and alarm data.

The activity, according to the cybersecurity company, took place in July 2025. The hacking crew is said to acquire initial access from Sylvanite, which rapidly weaponizes edge device vulnerabilities before patches are applied and hands off access for deeper operational technology (OT) intrusions.

"Voltzite moved beyond data exfiltration to direct manipulation of engineering workstations investigating what would trigger processes to stop," Dragos said. " This represents the removal of the last practical barrier between having access and causing physical consequences. Cellular gateways create unauthorized pathways into OT networks bypassing traditional security controls."

The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), on February 18, 2026, added CVE-2026-22769 to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, requiring Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to apply the patch by February 21, 2026.

[8] The Hacker News - 3 Ways to Start Your Intelligent Workflow Program 
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Wed, 18 Feb 2026 16:00:00 +0530
Link: https://thehackernews.com/2026/02/3-ways-to-start-your-intelligent.html

[TAM METİN - 781 kelime]
Security, IT, and engineering teams today are under relentless pressure to accelerate outcomes, cut operational drag, and unlock the full potential of AI and automation. But simply investing in tools isn’t enough. 88% of AI proofs-of-concept never make it to production, even though 70% of workers cite freeing time for high-value work as the primary AI automation motivation. Real impact comes from intelligent workflows that combine automation, AI-driven decisioning, and human ingenuity into seamless processes that work across teams and systems.

In this article, we’ll highlight three use cases across Security and IT that can serve as powerful starting points for your intelligent workflow program. For each use case, we’ll share a pre-built workflow to help you tackle real bottlenecks in your organization with automation while connecting directly into your existing tech stack. These use cases are great starting points to help you turn theory into practice and achieve measurable gains from day one.

Workflow #1 Automated Phishing Response

For security teams, responding to phishing emails can be a slow, burdensome process given the number of alerts and the growing sophistication of phishing attacks. By streamlining phishing analysis with automated workflows, security teams of all sizes get time back to focus on more critical issues and alerts.

Our first workflow, Analyze phishing email senders, URLs, and attachments, uses VirusTotal, URLScan.io, and Sublime Security to analyze key aspects of phishing emails such as file attachments, website behavior, email sender reputation, and detection rule matching. It then consolidates all of the results and displays them in a Tines page, which can be sent via email for archiving or further analysis.

Workflow #2 Agents for IT Service Request Automation

IT service desks are often overwhelmed with repetitive, time-consuming requests like password resets, software access provisioning, hardware troubleshooting, and account management. These tasks pull valuable technical resources away from strategic initiatives. When AI agents are deployed to handle these routine service requests, organizations can dramatically reduce response times from hours to seconds, be more likely to ensure 24/7 availability, and free IT teams to focus on complex problems that require human expertise.

The Automate IT service requests using Slack and agents workflow creates AI agents to categorize and process IT service requests. From a Slack message, the workflow categorizes requests into 3 categories: password resets, application access, or another action. Each request is then handled by a specialized agent.

The password reset agent verifies user identity and management relationships before processing. The application request agent identifies the correct application owner and facilitates access. Responses are handled over Slack, creating a self-serve flow that reduces manual IT involvement while letting teams decide when AI acts and when humans stay in the loop.

Workflow #3 Monitor and Manage Vulnerabilities

Security teams face an unrelenting stream of newly disclosed vulnerabilities. CISA's Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog is updated continuously as threat actors actively weaponize critical flaws. Automating the connection between vulnerability intelligence feeds and your asset inventory transforms this reactive scramble into a proactive rather than reactive defense. By automating the vulnerability detection process, security teams can cut response windows from days to minutes, and ensure they prioritize patching efforts based on real exposure rather than theoretical risk.

Without automation, organizations rely on manual monitoring of security bulletins, time-consuming spreadsheet comparisons between vulnerability databases and asset inventories, and delayed communications that leave critical gaps unaddressed while attackers move at machine speed. The result is increased breach risk, compliance failures, and security teams buried in manual triage work instead of strategic threat hunting and remediation.

The Check for new CISA vulnerabilities workflow monitors the CISA Vulnerability RSS feed and then uses the Tenable Vulnerability Management platform to check for any vulnerable systems. If vulnerabilities are detected, a message is sent via Microsoft Teams.

Intelligent Workflows that Keep Humans in the Loop

Intelligent workflows aren’t about replacing people, they’re about amplifying them. The three workflows above demonstrate how you can quickly move from isolated automation to connected, intelligent systems that blend AI, integrations, and human oversight to solve real operational problems.

Whether you’re responding to security threats, streamlining IT requests, or improving visibility into risk, these pre-built workflows provide practical, production-ready foundations you can adapt and extend as your needs evolve.

Tines’ intelligent workflow platform unites automation, AI agents, and human-in-the-loop controls to reduce repetitive “muckwork,” speed execution, and free teams to focus on higher-value work — while ensuring governance, integration, and scale so pilots don’t stall before they realize true value.

Get started today with one of these pre-built workflows or another from our broader story library. Prove the value first-hand and use it as a blueprint to scale an intelligent workflow program that drives meaningful impact across your organization.

[9] BleepingComputer - New 'Massiv' Android banking malware poses as an IPTV app
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Thu, 19 Feb 2026 05:00:00 -0500
Link: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-massiv-android-banking-malware-poses-as-an-iptv-app/

[TAM METİN - 526 kelime]
A new Android banking malware, which researchers named Massiv, is posing as an IPTV app to steal digital identities and access online banking accounts.

The malware relies on screen overlays and keylogging to obtain sensitive data and can take remote control of a compromised device.

In a campaign observed by researchers at fraud detection and mobile threat intelligence company ThreatFabric, Massiv targeted a Portuguese government app that connects with Chave Móvel Digital - Portugal’s digital authentication and signature system.

The two service contain user data that could be used to bypass know-your-customer (KYC) verifications or to access banking accounts and other public and private online services.

“MTI research identified cases where new accounts were opened in the name of the victim (user of the infected device) in new banks and services (not used by the victim),” describes the ThreatFabric report.

“Since those accounts are fully under fraudster control, they can further use them as a part of money laundering scheme as well as getting loans and cashing out the money, leaving unsuspecting victim in debts in the bank they never opened account themselves.”

Massiv provides two remote control modes for its operators: a screen live-streaming mode that leverages Android’s MediaProjection API, and a UI-tree mode that extracts structured data from the Accessibility Service.

The latter includes visible text, interface element names, screen coordinates, and interaction attributes, allowing attackers to click buttons, edit text fields, and more.

This second mode is particularly helpful for bypassing screen-capture protections commonly used in banking, communication, and other apps that host sensitive content.

IPTV lures on the rise

An interesting trend identified by ThreatFabric through the discovery of Massiv is the increasing use of IPTV apps as lures for Android malware infections, a technique that has increased over the past eight months.

These apps typically play a key role in copyright infringement, so they cannot be found on Google Play due to policy violations. Sourcing them as APKs from unofficial channels is considered normal for their users, who are accustomed to sideloading them.

In most cases, the IPTV app is fake, does not offer access to pirated broadcasts, and the APK is a dropper that installs the malware payload. In some cases, the app displays a legitimate IPTV website in a WebView to maintain the illusion.

The researchers report that fake IPTV-masking malware droppers have primarily targeted users in Spain, Portugal, France, and Turkey.

Android users are recommended to only download vetted apps from reputable publishers available on official channels (Google Play), keep Play Protect active, and use it to regularly scan the device.

[10] BleepingComputer - Critical infra Honeywell CCTVs vulnerable to auth bypass flaw
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Wed, 18 Feb 2026 15:58:20 -0500

[TAM METİN - 387 kelime]
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is warning of a critical vulnerability in multiple Honeywell CCTV products that allows unauthorized access to feeds or account hijacking.

Discovered by researcher Souvik Kanda and tracked as CVE-2026-1670, the security issue is classified as “missing authentication for critical function,” and received a crtical severity score of 9.8.

The flaw allows an unauthenticated attacker to change the recovery email address associated with a device account, enabling account takeover and unauthorized access to camera feeds.

“The affected product is vulnerable to an unauthenticated API endpoint exposure, which may allow an attacker to remotely change the "forgot password" recovery email address,” CISA says.

According to the security advisory, CVE-2026-1670 impacts the following models:

I-HIB2PI-UL 2MP IP 6.1.22.1216

SMB NDAA MVO-3 WDR_2MP_32M_PTZ_v2.0

PTZ WDR 2MP 32M WDR_2MP_32M_PTZ_v2.0

25M IPC WDR_2MP_32M_PTZ_v2.0

Honeywell is a major global supplier of security and video surveillance equipment with a broad range of CCTV camera models and related products deployed in commercial, industrial, and critical infrastructure settings worldwide.

The company offers many NDAA-compliant cameras that are suitable for deployment in U.S. government agencies and federal contractors.

The specific model families named in CISA’s advisory are mid-level video surveillance products used in small to medium business environments, offices, and warehouses, some of which may be part of critical facilities.

CISA stated that as of February 17th there were no known reports of public exploitation specifically targeting this vulnerability.

Nonetheless, the agency recommends minimizing network exposure of control system devices, isolating them behind firewalls, and using secure remote access methods such as updated VPN solutions when remote connectivity is necessary.

Honeywell has not published an advisory on CVE-2026-1670, but users are advised to contact the company’s support team for patch guidance.

[11] BleepingComputer - AI platforms can be abused for stealthy malware communication
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Wed, 18 Feb 2026 15:18:24 -0500
Link: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ai-platforms-can-be-abused-for-stealthy-malware-communication/

[TAM METİN - 666 kelime]
AI assistants like Grok and Microsoft Copilot with web browsing and URL-fetching capabilities can be abused to intermediate command-and-control (C2) activity.

Researchers at cybersecurity company Check Point discovered that threat actors can use AI services to relay communication between the C2 server and the target machine.

Attackers can exploit this mechanism to deliver commands and retrieve stolen data from victim systems.

The researchers created a proof-of-concept to show how it all works and disclosed their findings to Microsoft and xAI.

AI as a stealthy relay

Instead of malware connecting directly to a C2 server hosted on the attacker's infrastructure, Check Point’s idea was to have it communicate with an AI web interface, instructing the agent to fetch an attacker-controlled URL and receive the response in the AI’s output.

In Check Point's scenario, the malware interacts with the AI service using the WebView2 component in Windows 11. The researchers say that even if the component is missing on the target system, the threat actor can deliver it embedded in the malware.

WebView2 is used by developers to show web content in the interface of native desktop applications, thus eliminating the need of a full-featured browser.

The researchers created "a C++ program that opens a WebView pointing to either Grok or Copilot." This way, the attacker can submit to the assistant instructions that can include commands to be executed or extract information from the compromised machine.

The webpage responds with embedded instructions that the attacker can change at will, which the AI extracts or summarizes in response to the malware’s query.

The malware parses the AI assistant's response in the chat and extracts the instructions.

This creates a bidirectional communication channel via the AI service, which is trusted by internet security tools and can thus help carry out data exchanges without being flagged or blocked.

Check Point’s PoC, tested on Grok and Microsoft Copilot, does not require an account or API keys for the AI services, making traceability and primary infrastructure blocks less of a problem.

“The usual downside for attackers [abusing legitimate services for C2] is how easily these channels can be shut down: block the account, revoke the API key, suspend the tenant,” explains Check Point.

“Directly interacting with an AI agent through a web page changes this. There is no API key to revoke, and if anonymous usage is allowed, there may not even be an account to block.”

The researchers explain that safeguards exist to block obviously malicious exchanges on the said AI platforms, but these safety checks can be easily bypassed by encrypting the data into high-entropy blobs.

CheckPoint argues that AI as a C2 proxy is just one of multiple options for abusing AI services, which could include operational reasoning such as assessing if the target system is worth exploiting and how to proceed without raising alarms.

BleepingComputer has contacted Microsoft to ask whether Copilot is still exploitable in the way demonstrated by Check Point and the safeguards that could prevent such attacks, and a spokesperson responded with the following:

“We appreciate Check Point Research for identifying and responsibly reporting this proof of concept. As with any compromised device, attackers may attempt to communicate using a variety of available services, including AI-based services. We recommend users implement defense-in-depth security practices, which are designed to help prevent the initial malware infection and reduce the impact of post-compromise activity.” – a Microsoft spokesperson

[12] BleepingComputer - Telegram channels expose rapid weaponization of SmarterMail flaws
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Wed, 18 Feb 2026 11:27:38 -0500
Link: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/telegram-channels-expose-rapid-weaponization-of-smartermail-flaws/

[TAM METİN - 1215 kelime]
Flare researchers monitoring underground Telegram channels and cybercrime forums have observed threat actors rapidly sharing proof-of-concept exploits, offensive tools, and stolen administrator credentials related to recently disclosed SmarterMail vulnerabilities, providing insight into how quickly attackers weaponize new security flaws.

The activity occurred within days of the vulnerabilities being disclosed, with threat actors sharing and selling exploit code and compromised access tied to CVE-2026-24423 and CVE-2026-23760, critical flaws that enable remote code execution and authentication bypass on exposed email servers.

These vulnerabilities have since been confirmed in real-world attacks, including ransomware campaigns, highlighting how attackers increasingly target email infrastructure as an initial access point into corporate networks, allowing them to move laterally and establish persistent footholds.

CVE-2026-24423 and CVE-2026-23760: Critical RCE and Auth Bypass Flaws

Multiple recently disclosed SmarterMail vulnerabilities created a perfect storm that made the platform highly attractive to attackers. Among them, CVE-2026-24423 stands out as a critical unauthenticated remote code execution flaw affecting versions prior to Build 9511.

With a CVSS score of 9.3 and no user interaction required, the flaw is particularly suited for automation, large-scale scanning, and mass exploitation campaigns.

In parallel, additional vulnerabilities CVE-2026-23760 (CVSS 9.3) include authentication bypass and password reset logic flaws. It allows attackers to reset administrator credentials or gain privileged access to the platform. Research also shows that attackers were quickly reverse-engineering patches to identify and weaponize these weaknesses within days of release.

When combined, these issues enabled full server takeover scenarios, where attackers could move from application-level access to operating system control and potentially domain-level compromise in connected environments.

From an attacker’s perspective, this combination is ideal: SmarterMail is a network-exposed service, often holds a high trust position inside enterprise environments, and in many cases is monitored less aggressively than endpoint systems protected by EDR.

Once proof-of-concept exploit code becomes available, exploitation can be rapidly operationalized - meaning the timeline from vulnerability disclosure to ransomware deployment can shrink to days.

SmarterTools Breached by Own Product Flaw, Ransomware Groups Follow

Recent incidents demonstrate exactly how this pipeline plays out.

According to a SmarterTools report, SmarterTools was breached in January 2026 after attackers exploited an unpatched SmarterMail server running on an internal VM that was exposed inside their network.

The compromised environment included office and lab networks and a data-center segment connected through Active Directory, where attackers moved laterally and impacted around a dozen Windows servers.

The company shut down the affected infrastructure, restored systems from backup, rotated credentials, and removed some Windows/AD dependencies. Having said that, it was reported that core customer services and data were unaffected. Attackers gained an internal network foothold and attempted typical ransomware-style post-exploitation actions; it wasn't successful, thanks to network segmentation.

In another investigation published by Bleeping Computer, ransomware operators gained initial access through SmarterMail vulnerabilities and waited before triggering encryption payloads, a classic affiliate behavior pattern.

This pattern is important:

Initial access via email server vulnerability

Credential harvesting or token extraction

Lateral movement via Active Directory

Persistence via scheduled tasks or DFIR tool abuse

Ransomware deployment after staging period

Some campaigns have been linked to the Warlock ransomware group, with overlaps observed with nation-state-aligned activity clusters.

Detect Exploits Before Ransomware Groups Strike

Flare monitors underground forums and Telegram channels where threat actors share PoCs, exploits, and compromised credentials within hours of disclosure.

Get early warning when your infrastructure is discussed or targeted by ransomware operators.

Email Servers: Identity Infrastructure Attackers Target First

Email servers sit at a unique intersection of trust and visibility.

Domain authentication tokens

Password reset capabilities

External communication channels

Access to internal contact graphs

Integration with identity and directory services

Attackers understand that email ecosystems rely on multi-component authentication chains where a single weak link can break overall trust. Compromise the email infrastructure and you effectively compromise identity.

1,200+ Vulnerable Servers Identified on Shodan

We found ~34,000 servers on Shodan with indications of running SmarterMail. Out of the 34,000, there were 17,754 unique servers.

A further inspection of these servers shows that 1,185 are vulnerable to authentication bypass or RCE flaws. Other publications talk about ~6,000 vulnerable servers.

A geo-location analysis of these 1,185 servers shows US dominance:

A further analysis of the ISPs and Organizations shows a very diverse distribution of open SmarterMail servers, many self-hosted admin panels, shared hosting, VPS providers, and general-purpose cloud networks, typical of deployment by individuals rather than organizations.

This may indicate that after the strong security hype over the past weeks, organizations were quick to react and block this attack surface.

Underground Forums Share Exploits Within Days of Disclosure

The underground ecosystems are fast to react to such publications. The CVEs were published around the beginning of January, and on the same day, there were mentions and references to these vulnerabilities. To date, we’ve seen dozens of publications and references to these vulnerabilities.

This is normal underground behavior when it comes to critical vulnerabilities.

We have also seen some more malicious references. A few days after the first publication, there were references to Proof of Concept or exploit of the vulnerabilities. For instance, an Arabic-speaking Telegram channel shows PoC.

You can also see how the threat actor is showing proof of concept:

And another threat actor is showing a proof of concept to this vulnerability:

In a Spanish-speaking Telegram group, we saw references to an Offensive Security Tool:

On another Telegram group, we saw a data dump of admin credentials highlighted as it comes from a compromised SmarterMail server:

When accessing one of the links, you can indeed see a long list of admin credentials and the domains (or login) to which they belong.

CISA Confirms Active Exploitation in Ransomware Campaigns

These vulnerabilities were published in the beginning of 2026, CISA added CVE-2026-24423 to the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog in the beginning of February 2026, after confirming active ransomware exploitation.

This confirms that attackers are quick to exploit newly discovered critical RCE- related vulnerabilities:

Vulnerability disclosure

PoC written and released

Mass scanning operation

Weaponization: Data exfiltration, Ransomware etc.

Timeline shrinking from months/weeks to days.

How to Protect Email Infrastructure From Ransomware Access

Many organizations still treat email servers as “ONLY application infrastructure”. Well, they are not!

They are identity infrastructures that enable many follow-up attack vectors, as well as containing secrets and business logic. Defensive priorities should include:

Patch Urgency: Critical email server vulnerabilities should be treated like domain controller vulnerabilities.

Identity Telemetry: Organizations should monitor these environments for:
	Admin password resets
API calls to external hosts
Unexpected outbound HTTP from mail servers

Admin password resets

API calls to external hosts

Unexpected outbound HTTP from mail servers

Network Segmentation: Email infrastructure should never have unrestricted access to internal networks.

Threat Hunting Practice:
	API abuse patterns
Scheduled task persistence
Unexpected tooling like DFIR frameworks or remote admin tools

Scheduled task persistence

Unexpected tooling like DFIR frameworks or remote admin tools

Email Servers Are Identity Infrastructure—Secure Them Accordingly

The SmarterMail cases show once again how modern cybercrime operations are quick to add newly discovered initial access to their ongoing operation.

It also re-emphasizes the critical role email servers take in the modern organization:

Invaluable reconnaissance data for follow-up cybercrime

Organizations that continue treating them as just “messaging systems” will remain vulnerable to this new generation of intrusion pipelines.

[13] BleepingComputer - Microsoft: Anti-phishing rules mistakenly blocked emails, Teams messages
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Wed, 18 Feb 2026 11:26:53 -0500
Link: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-anti-phishing-rules-mistakenly-blocked-emails-teams-messages/

[TAM METİN - 553 kelime]
Microsoft says an Exchange Online issue that mistakenly quarantined legitimate emails last week was triggered by faulty heuristic detection rules designed to block credential phishing campaigns.

As Microsoft explains in a preliminary post-incident report published this week, a software error in its email security system incorrectly flagged thousands of legitimate URLs as phishing links for nearly a week, blocking users from opening emails and Teams messages.

The incident, tracked by Microsoft under EX1227432, began on February 5 and was not fully resolved until February 12. During that period, users across Exchange Online and Microsoft Teams were unable to open links in messages, with some of their emails quarantined entirely.

Administrators also received warnings that a "potentially malicious URL click was detected," alerts that Microsoft later confirmed were false positives.

The root cause was a logic error in a detection system designed to identify new credential phishing attacks. Shortly after the system was updated, it began flagging legitimate URLs at a far higher rate than intended, triggering a cascade of automated responses that aggravated the problem.

Other security tools within Microsoft's detection infrastructure also amplified the incident's impact, and a separate bug in the company's security signature systems further delayed efforts to roll back the flawed detection rules.

"This issue occurred due to a logic error in a heuristic detection aimed at novel credential phishing campaigns that spiked several hours after release," Microsoft explained.

"This spike in detection resulted in thousands of URL's being incorrectly identified as phishing, triggering blocks for newly delivered emails containing those URL's, ZAP events to remove email and Teams messages with those URL's in them, and also generating XDR alerts for click events related to these alerts."

Microsoft said that any user who received emails or Teams messages containing specific URLs may have been affected, but the company has yet to disclose the total number of impacted users. However, as BleepingComputer previously reported, Microsoft classified the issue as an "incident," which usually involves noticeable user impact.

While this preliminary report was published on Monday, Microsoft said that it will issue a final report within five business days of full resolution.

Microsoft has addressed other issues over the last several years that resulted in emails being quarantined or incorrectly tagged as spam or malicious. For instance, an Exchange Online bug caused a machine learning model to incorrectly flag emails from Gmail accounts as spam, while another one caused anti-spam systems to mistakenly quarantine some users' emails.

More recently, in September, an anti-spam service issue blocked Exchange Online and Microsoft Teams users from opening URLs and mistakenly quarantined some of their emails.

Microsoft is also working to fix a bug that allowed its AI-powered Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat to summarize confidential emails since late January.

[TAM METİN - 500 kelime]
Hackers have stolen the personal and contact information of nearly 1 million accounts after breaching the systems of Figure Technology Solutions, a self-described blockchain-native financial technology company.

Founded in 2018, Figure uses the Provenance blockchain for lending, borrowing, and securities trading, and has unlocked over $22 billion in home equity with over 250 partners, including banks, credit unions, fintechs, and home improvement companies.

While the blockchain lender didn't publicly disclose the incident, a Figure spokesperson told TechCrunch on Friday that the attackers stole "a limited number of files" in a social engineering attack.

BleepingComputer has also reached out to Figure with further questions about the breach, but a response was not immediately available.

Although the company has yet to share how many individuals were affected by the data breach, notification service Have I Been Pwned has now revealed the extent of the incident, reporting that data from 967,200 accounts was stolen in the attack.

"In February 2026, data obtained from the fintech lending platform Figure was publicly posted online," Have I Been Pwned said on Wednesday.

"The exposed data, dating back to January 2026, contained over 900k unique email addresses along with names, phone numbers, physical addresses and dates of birth. Figure confirmed the incident and attributed it to a social engineering attack in which an employee was tricked into providing access."

The ShinyHunters extortion group claimed responsibility for the breach and added the company to its dark web leak site, leaking 2.5GB of data allegedly stolen from thousands of loan applicants.

In recent weeks, ShinyHunters claimed similar breaches at Canada Goose, Panera Bread, Betterment, SoundCloud, PornHub, and CrowdStrike.

While not all of them are part of the same campaign, some of these victims were breached in a voice phishing (vishing) campaign targeting single sign-on (SSO) accounts at Okta, Microsoft, and Google across more than 100 high-profile organizations.

The attackers are impersonating IT support, calling their targets' employees and tricking them into entering credentials and multi-factor authentication (MFA) codes on phishing sites that impersonate their companies' login portals.

Once in, they gain access to the victim's SSO account, which provides them with access to other connected enterprise applications and services, including Salesforce, Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, SAP, Slack, Zendesk, Dropbox, Adobe, Atlassian, and many others.

As part of this campaign, ShinyHunters also breached online dating giant Match Group, which owns multiple popular dating services, including Tinder, Hinge, Meetic, Match.com, and OkCupid.

[15] BleepingComputer - Microsoft says bug causes Copilot to summarize confidential emails
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Wed, 18 Feb 2026 07:03:05 -0500
Link: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-says-bug-causes-copilot-to-summarize-confidential-emails/

[TAM METİN - 414 kelime]
Microsoft says a Microsoft 365 Copilot bug has been causing the AI assistant to summarize confidential emails since late January, bypassing data loss prevention (DLP) policies that organizations rely on to protect sensitive information.

According to a service alert seen by BleepingComputer, this bug (tracked under CW1226324 and first detected on January 21) affects the Copilot "work tab" chat feature, which incorrectly reads and summarizes emails stored in users' Sent Items and Drafts folders, including messages that carry confidentiality labels explicitly designed to restrict access by automated tools.

Copilot Chat (short for Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat) is the company's AI-powered, content-aware chat that lets users interact with AI agents. ​Microsoft began rolling out Copilot Chat to Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and OneNote for paying Microsoft 365 business customers in September 2025.

"Users' email messages with a confidential label applied are being incorrectly processed by Microsoft 365 Copilot chat," Microsoft said when it confirmed this issue.

"The Microsoft 365 Copilot 'work tab' Chat is summarizing email messages even though these email messages have a sensitivity label applied and a DLP policy is configured."

Microsoft has since confirmed that an unspecified code error is responsible and said it began rolling out a fix in early February. As of Wednesday, the company said it was continuing to monitor the deployment and is reaching out to a subset of affected users to verify that the fix is working.

"A code issue is allowing items in the sent items and draft folders to be picked up by Copilot even though confidential labels are set in place," Microsoft added.

Microsoft has not provided a final timeline for full remediation and has not disclosed how many users or organizations were affected, saying only that the scope of impact may change as the investigation continues.

However, this ongoing incident has been tagged as an advisory, a flag commonly used to describe service issues typically involving limited scope or impact.

[16] Krebs on Security - Kimwolf Botnet Swamps Anonymity Network I2P
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Wed, 11 Feb 2026 16:08:11 +0000
Link: https://krebsonsecurity.com/2026/02/kimwolf-botnet-swamps-anonymity-network-i2p/

[TAM METİN - 831 kelime]
For the past week, the massive “Internet of Things” (IoT) botnet known as Kimwolf has been disrupting The Invisible Internet Project (I2P), a decentralized, encrypted communications network designed to anonymize and secure online communications. I2P users started reporting disruptions in the network around the same time the Kimwolf botmasters began relying on it to evade takedown attempts against the botnet’s control servers.

Kimwolf is a botnet that surfaced in late 2025 and quickly infected millions of systems, turning poorly secured IoT devices like TV streaming boxes, digital picture frames and routers into relays for malicious traffic and abnormally large distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.

I2P is a decentralized, privacy-focused network that allows people to communicate and share information anonymously.

“It works by routing data through multiple encrypted layers across volunteer-operated nodes, hiding both the sender’s and receiver’s locations,” the I2P website explains. “The result is a secure, censorship-resistant network designed for private websites, messaging, and data sharing.”

On February 3, I2P users began complaining on the organization’s GitHub page about tens of thousands of routers suddenly overwhelming the network, preventing existing users from communicating with legitimate nodes. Users reported a rapidly increasing number of new routers joining the network that were unable to transmit data, and that the mass influx of new systems had overwhelmed the network to the point where users could no longer connect.

I2P users complaining about service disruptions from a rapidly increasing number of routers suddenly swamping the network.

When one I2P user asked whether the network was under attack, another user replied, “Looks like it. My physical router freezes when the number of connections exceeds 60,000.”

A graph shared by I2P developers showing a marked drop in successful connections on the I2P network around the time the Kimwolf botnet started trying to use the network for fallback communications.

The same day that I2P users began noticing the outages, the individuals in control of Kimwolf posted to their Discord channel that they had accidentally disrupted I2P after attempting to join 700,000 Kimwolf-infected bots as nodes on the network.

The Kimwolf botmaster openly discusses what they are doing with the botnet in a Discord channel with my name on it.

Although Kimwolf is known as a potent weapon for launching DDoS attacks, the outages caused this week by some portion of the botnet attempting to join I2P are what’s known as a “Sybil attack,” a threat in peer-to-peer networks where a single entity can disrupt the system by creating, controlling, and operating a large number of fake, pseudonymous identities.

Indeed, the number of Kimwolf-infected routers that tried to join I2P this past week was many times the network’s normal size. I2P’s Wikipedia page says the network consists of roughly 55,000 computers distributed throughout the world, with each participant acting as both a router (to relay traffic) and a client.

However, Lance James, founder of the New York City based cybersecurity consultancy Unit 221B and the original founder of I2P, told KrebsOnSecurity the entire I2P network now consists of between 15,000 and 20,000 devices on any given day.

An I2P user posted this graph on Feb. 10, showing tens of thousands of routers — mostly from the United States — suddenly attempting to join the network.

Benjamin Brundage is founder of Synthient, a startup that tracks proxy services and was the first to document Kimwolf’s unique spreading techniques. Brundage said the Kimwolf operator(s) have been trying to build a command and control network that can’t easily be taken down by security companies and network operators that are working together to combat the spread of the botnet.

Brundage said the people in control of Kimwolf have been experimenting with using I2P and a similar anonymity network — Tor — as a backup command and control network, although there have been no reports of widespread disruptions in the Tor network recently.

“I don’t think their goal is to take I2P down,” he said. “It’s more they’re looking for an alternative to keep the botnet stable in the face of takedown attempts.”

The Kimwolf botnet created challenges for Cloudflare late last year when it began instructing millions of infected devices to use Cloudflare’s domain name system (DNS) settings, causing control domains associated with Kimwolf to repeatedly usurp Amazon, Apple, Google and Microsoft in Cloudflare’s public ranking of the most frequently requested websites.

James said the I2P network is still operating at about half of its normal capacity, and that a new release is rolling out which should bring some stability improvements over the next week for users.

Meanwhile, Brundage said the good news is Kimwolf’s overlords appear to have quite recently alienated some of their more competent developers and operators, leading to a rookie mistake this past week that caused the botnet’s overall numbers to drop by more than 600,000 infected systems.

“It seems like they’re just testing stuff, like running experiments in production,” he said. “But the botnet’s numbers are dropping significantly now, and they don’t seem to know what they’re doing.”

[17] Krebs on Security - Please Don’t Feed the Scattered Lapsus ShinyHunters

[TAM METİN - 1200 kelime]
A prolific data ransom gang that calls itself Scattered Lapsus ShinyHunters (SLSH) has a distinctive playbook when it seeks to extort payment from victim firms: Harassing, threatening and even swatting executives and their families, all while notifying journalists and regulators about the extent of the intrusion. Some victims reportedly are paying — perhaps as much to contain the stolen data as to stop the escalating personal attacks. But a top SLSH expert warns that engaging at all beyond a “We’re not paying” response only encourages further harassment, noting that the group’s fractious and unreliable history means the only winning move is not to pay.

Unlike traditional, highly regimented Russia-based ransomware affiliate groups, SLSH is an unruly and somewhat fluid English-language extortion gang that appears uninterested in building a reputation of consistent behavior whereby victims might have some measure of confidence that the criminals will keep their word if paid.

That’s according to Allison Nixon, director of research at the New York City based security consultancy Unit 221B. Nixon has been closely tracking the criminal group and individual members as they bounce between various Telegram channels used to extort and harass victims, and she said SLSH differs from traditional data ransom groups in other important ways that argue against trusting them to do anything they say they’ll do — such as destroying stolen data.

Like SLSH, many traditional Russian ransomware groups have employed high-pressure tactics to force payment in exchange for a decryption key and/or a promise to delete stolen data, such as publishing a dark web shaming blog with samples of stolen data next to a countdown clock, or notifying journalists and board members of the victim company. But Nixon said the extortion from SLSH quickly escalates way beyond that — to threats of physical violence against executives and their families, DDoS attacks on the victim’s website, and repeated email-flooding campaigns.

SLSH is known for breaking into companies by phishing employees over the phone, and using the purloined access to steal sensitive internal data. In a January 30 blog post, Google’s security forensics firm Mandiant said SLSH’s most recent extortion attacks stem from incidents spanning early to mid-January 2026, when SLSH members pretended to be IT staff and called employees at targeted victim organizations claiming that the company was updating MFA settings.

“The threat actor directed the employees to victim-branded credential harvesting sites to capture their SSO credentials and MFA codes, and then registered their own device for MFA,” the blog post explained.

Victims often first learn of the breach when their brand name is uttered on whatever ephemeral new public Telegram group chat SLSH is using to threaten, extort and harass their prey. According to Nixon, the coordinated harassment on the SLSH Telegram channels is part of a well-orchestrated strategy to overwhelm the victim organization by manufacturing humiliation that pushes them over the threshold to pay.

Nixon said multiple executives at targeted organizations have been subject to “swatting” attacks, wherein SLSH communicated a phony bomb threat or hostage situation at the target’s address in the hopes of eliciting a heavily armed police response at their home or place of work.

“A big part of what they’re doing to victims is the psychological aspect of it, like harassing executives’ kids and threatening the board of the company,” Nixon told KrebsOnSecurity. “And while these victims are getting extortion demands, they’re simultaneously getting outreach from media outlets saying, ‘Hey, do you have any comments on the bad things we’re going to write about you.”

In a blog post today, Unit 221B argues that no one should negotiate with SLSH because the group has demonstrated a willingness to extort victims based on promises that it has no intention to keep. Nixon points out that all of SLSH’s known members hail from The Com, shorthand for a constellation of cybercrime-focused Discord and Telegram communities which serve as a kind of distributed social network that facilitates instant collaboration.

Nixon said Com-based extortion groups tend to instigate feuds and drama between group members, leading to lying, betrayals, credibility destroying behavior, backstabbing, and sabotaging each other.

“With this type of ongoing dysfunction, often compounding by substance abuse, these threat actors often aren’t able to act with the core goal in mind of completing a successful, strategic ransom operation,” Nixon wrote. “They continually lose control with outbursts that put their strategy and operational security at risk, which severely limits their ability to build a professional, scalable, and sophisticated criminal organization network for continued successful ransoms – unlike other, more tenured and professional criminal organizations focused on ransomware alone.”

Intrusions from established ransomware groups typically center around encryption/decryption malware that mostly stays on the affected machine. In contrast, Nixon said, ransom from a Com group is often structured the same as violent sextortion schemes against minors, wherein members of The Com will steal damaging information, threaten to release it, and “promise” to delete it if the victim complies without any guarantee or technical proof point that they will keep their word. She writes:

A key component of SLSH’s efforts to convince victims to pay, Nixon said, involves manipulating the media into hyping the threat posed by this group. This approach also borrows a page from the playbook of sextortion attacks, she said, which encourages predators to keep targets continuously engaged and worrying about the consequences of non-compliance.

“On days where SLSH had no substantial criminal ‘win’ to announce, they focused on announcing death threats and harassment to keep law enforcement, journalists, and cybercrime industry professionals focused on this group,” she said.

Nixon knows a thing or two about being threatened by SLSH: For the past several months, the group’s Telegram channels have been replete with threats of physical violence against her, against Yours Truly, and against other security researchers. These threats, she said, are just another way the group seeks to generate media attention and achieve a veneer of credibility, but they are useful as indicators of compromise because SLSH members tend to name drop and malign security researchers even in their communications with victims.

“Watch for the following behaviors in their communications to you or their public statements,” Unit 221B’s advisory reads. “Repeated abusive mentions of Allison Nixon (or “A.N”), Unit 221B, or cybersecurity journalists—especially Brian Krebs—or any other cybersecurity employee, or cybersecurity company. Any threats to kill, or commit terrorism, or violence against internal employees, cybersecurity employees, investigators, and journalists.”

Unit 221B says that while the pressure campaign during an extortion attempt may be traumatizing to employees, executives, and their family members, entering into drawn-out negotiations with SLSH incentivizes the group to increase the level of harm and risk, which could include the physical safety of employees and their families.

“The breached data will never go back to the way it was, but we can assure you that the harassment will end,” Nixon said. “So, your decision to pay should be a separate issue from the harassment. We believe that when you separate these issues, you will objectively see that the best course of action to protect your interests, in both the short and long term, is to refuse payment.”

[18] Krebs on Security - Who Operates the Badbox 2.0 Botnet?
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Mon, 26 Jan 2026 16:11:38 +0000
Link: https://krebsonsecurity.com/2026/01/who-operates-the-badbox-2-0-botnet/

[TAM METİN - 1452 kelime]
The cybercriminals in control of Kimwolf — a disruptive botnet that has infected more than 2 million devices — recently shared a screenshot indicating they’d compromised the control panel for Badbox 2.0, a vast China-based botnet powered by malicious software that comes pre-installed on many Android TV streaming boxes. Both the FBI and Google say they are hunting for the people behind Badbox 2.0, and thanks to bragging by the Kimwolf botmasters we may now have a much clearer idea about that.

Our first story of 2026, The Kimwolf Botnet is Stalking Your Local Network, detailed the unique and highly invasive methods Kimwolf uses to spread. The story warned that the vast majority of Kimwolf infected systems were unofficial Android TV boxes that are typically marketed as a way to watch unlimited (pirated) movie and TV streaming services for a one-time fee.

Our January 8 story, Who Benefitted from the Aisuru and Kimwolf Botnets?, cited multiple sources saying the current administrators of Kimwolf went by the nicknames “Dort” and “Snow.” Earlier this month, a close former associate of Dort and Snow shared what they said was a screenshot the Kimwolf botmasters had taken while logged in to the Badbox 2.0 botnet control panel.

That screenshot, a portion of which is shown below, shows seven authorized users of the control panel, including one that doesn’t quite match the others: According to my source, the account “ABCD” (the one that is logged in and listed in the top right of the screenshot) belongs to Dort, who somehow figured out how to add their email address as a valid user of the Badbox 2.0 botnet.

The control panel for the Badbox 2.0 botnet lists seven authorized users and their email addresses. Click to enlarge.

Badbox has a storied history that well predates Kimwolf’s rise in October 2025. In July 2025, Google filed a “John Doe” lawsuit (PDF) against 25 unidentified defendants accused of operating Badbox 2.0, which Google described as a botnet of over ten million unsanctioned Android streaming devices engaged in advertising fraud. Google said Badbox 2.0, in addition to compromising multiple types of devices prior to purchase, also can infect devices by requiring the download of malicious apps from unofficial marketplaces.

Google’s lawsuit came on the heels of a June 2025 advisory from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), which warned that cyber criminals were gaining unauthorized access to home networks by either configuring the products with malware prior to the user’s purchase, or infecting the device as it downloads required applications that contain backdoors — usually during the set-up process.

The FBI said Badbox 2.0 was discovered after the original Badbox campaign was disrupted in 2024. The original Badbox was identified in 2023, and primarily consisted of Android operating system devices (TV boxes) that were compromised with backdoor malware prior to purchase.

KrebsOnSecurity was initially skeptical of the claim that the Kimwolf botmasters had hacked the Badbox 2.0 botnet. That is, until we began digging into the history of the qq.com email addresses in the screenshot above.

An online search for the address 34557257@qq.com (pictured in the screenshot above as the user “Chen“) shows it is listed as a point of contact for a number of China-based technology companies, including:

–Beijing Hong Dake Wang Science & Technology Co Ltd.
–Beijing Hengchuang Vision Mobile Media Technology Co. Ltd.
–Moxin Beijing Science and Technology Co. Ltd.

The website for Beijing Hong Dake Wang Science is asmeisvip[.]net, a domain that was flagged in a March 2025 report by HUMAN Security as one of several dozen sites tied to the distribution and management of the Badbox 2.0 botnet. Ditto for moyix[.]com, a domain associated with Beijing Hengchuang Vision Mobile.

A search at the breach tracking service Constella Intelligence finds 34557257@qq.com at one point used the password “cdh76111.” Pivoting on that password in Constella shows it is known to have been used by just two other email accounts: daihaic@gmail.com and cathead@gmail.com.

Constella found cathead@gmail.com registered an account at jd.com (China’s largest online retailer) in 2021 under the name “陈代海,” which translates to “Chen Daihai.” According to DomainTools.com, the name Chen Daihai is present in the original registration records (2008) for moyix[.]com, along with the email address cathead@astrolink[.]cn.

Incidentally, astrolink[.]cn also is among the Badbox 2.0 domains identified in HUMAN Security’s 2025 report. DomainTools finds cathead@astrolink[.]cn was used to register more than a dozen domains, including vmud[.]net, yet another Badbox 2.0 domain tagged by HUMAN Security.

A cached copy of astrolink[.]cn preserved at archive.org shows the website belongs to a mobile app development company whose full name is Beijing Astrolink Wireless Digital Technology Co. Ltd. The archived website reveals a “Contact Us” page that lists a Chen Daihai as part of the company’s technology department. The other person featured on that contact page is Zhu Zhiyu, and their email address is listed as xavier@astrolink[.]cn.

A Google-translated version of Astrolink’s website, circa 2009. Image: archive.org.

Astute readers will notice that the user Mr.Zhu in the Badbox 2.0 panel used the email address xavierzhu@qq.com. Searching this address in Constella reveals a jd.com account registered in the name of Zhu Zhiyu. A rather unique password used by this account matches the password used by the address xavierzhu@gmail.com, which DomainTools finds was the original registrant of astrolink[.]cn.

The very first account listed in the Badbox 2.0 panel — “admin,” registered in November 2020 — used the email address 189308024@qq.com. DomainTools shows this email is found in the 2022 registration records for the domain guilincloud[.]cn, which includes the registrant name “Huang Guilin.”

Constella finds 189308024@qq.com is associated with the China phone number 18681627767. The open-source intelligence platform osint.industries reveals this phone number is connected to a Microsoft profile created in 2014 under the name Guilin Huang (桂林 黄). The cyber intelligence platform Spycloud says that phone number was used in 2017 to create an account at the Chinese social media platform Weibo under the username “h_guilin.”

The public information attached to Guilin Huang’s Microsoft account, according to the breach tracking service osintindustries.com.

The remaining three users and corresponding qq.com email addresses were all connected to individuals in China. However, none of them (nor Mr. Huang) had any apparent connection to the entities created and operated by Chen Daihai and Zhu Zhiyu — or to any corporate entities for that matter. Also, none of these individuals responded to requests for comment.

The mind map below includes search pivots on the email addresses, company names and phone numbers that suggest a connection between Chen Daihai, Zhu Zhiyu, and Badbox 2.0.

This mind map includes search pivots on the email addresses, company names and phone numbers that appear to connect Chen Daihai and Zhu Zhiyu to Badbox 2.0. Click to enlarge.

The idea that the Kimwolf botmasters could have direct access to the Badbox 2.0 botnet is a big deal, but explaining exactly why that is requires some background on how Kimwolf spreads to new devices. The botmasters figured out they could trick residential proxy services into relaying malicious commands to vulnerable devices behind the firewall on the unsuspecting user’s local network.

The vulnerable systems sought out by Kimwolf are primarily Internet of Things (IoT) devices like unsanctioned Android TV boxes and digital photo frames that have no discernible security or authentication built-in. Put simply, if you can communicate with these devices, you can compromise them with a single command.

Our January 2 story featured research from the proxy-tracking firm Synthient, which alerted 11 different residential proxy providers that their proxy endpoints were vulnerable to being abused for this kind of local network probing and exploitation.

Most of those vulnerable proxy providers have since taken steps to prevent customers from going upstream into the local networks of residential proxy endpoints, and it appeared that Kimwolf would no longer be able to quickly spread to millions of devices simply by exploiting some residential proxy provider.

However, the source of that Badbox 2.0 screenshot said the Kimwolf botmasters had an ace up their sleeve the whole time: Secret access to the Badbox 2.0 botnet control panel.

“Dort has gotten unauthorized access,” the source said. “So, what happened is normal proxy providers patched this. But Badbox doesn’t sell proxies by itself, so it’s not patched. And as long as Dort has access to Badbox, they would be able to load” the Kimwolf malware directly onto TV boxes associated with Badbox 2.0.

The source said it isn’t clear how Dort gained access to the Badbox botnet panel. But it’s unlikely that Dort’s existing account will persist for much longer: All of our notifications to the qq.com email addresses listed in the control panel screenshot received a copy of that image, as well as questions about the apparently rogue ABCD account.

[19] Security Affairs - Irish regulator probes X after Grok allegedly generated sexual images of children
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[TAM METİN - 622 kelime]
Ireland’s Data Protection Commission has launched another investigation into X over Grok’s AI image generator. The probe focuses on reports that the tool created large volumes of non-consensual and sexualized images, including content involving children, potentially violating EU data protection laws.

“The Data Protection Commission (DPC) has today announced that it has opened an inquiry into X Internet Unlimited Company (XIUC) under section 110 of the Data Protection Act 2018.” reads the Ireland’s DPC’s press release. “The inquiry concerns the apparent creation, and publication on the X platform, of potentially harmful, non-consensual intimate and/or sexualised images, containing or otherwise involving the processing of personal data of EU/EEA data subjects, including children, using generative artificial intelligence functionality associated with the Grok large language model within the X platform.”

In January, X’s safety team blocked the @Grok account from editing images of real people to add revealing clothing, such as bikinis, for all users. Image creation and editing features now remain available only to paid subscribers, adding an accountability layer to deter abuse and policy violations.

“We have implemented technological measures to prevent the [@]Grok account on X globally from allowing the editing of images of real people in revealing clothing such as bikinis. This restriction applies to all users, including paid subscribers.” reads the X announcement. “Image creation and the ability to edit images via the [@]Grok account on X are now only available to paid subscribers globally. This adds an extra layer of protection by helping to ensure that individuals who attempt to abuse the [@]Grok account to violate the law or our policies can be held accountable.”

Ireland’s Data Protection Commission’s probe will assess whether X breached key GDPR provisions on lawful data processing, privacy by design, and impact assessments. As X’s lead EU regulator, the DPC said it had already engaged with the company and will now conduct a large-scale investigation into its compliance with fundamental data protection obligations.

“The decision to commence the inquiry was notified to XIUC on Monday 16 February.” Ireland’s DPC  continues. “The purpose of the inquiry is to determine whether XIUC has complied with its obligations under the GDPR, including its obligations under Article 5 (principles of processing), Article 6 (lawfulness of processing), Article 25 (Data Protection by Design and by Default) and Article 35 (requirement to carry out a Data Protection Impact Assessment) with regard to the personal data processed of EU/EEA data subjects.”

The Irish DPC joins a growing list of regulators investigating X, including the European Commission, the UK’s ICO and Ofcom, and authorities in Australia, Canada, India, Indonesia, and Malaysia. France has also been conducting a broad investigation since January, expanding its scope as new concerns arise.

“The DPC has been engaging with XIUC since media reports first emerged a number of weeks ago concerning the alleged ability of X users to prompt the @Grok account on X to generate sexualised images of real people, including children. As the Lead Supervisory Authority for XIUC across the EU/EEA, the DPC has commenced a large-scale inquiry which will examine XIUC’s compliance with some of their fundamental obligations under the GDPR in relation to the matters at hand.” said Deputy Commissioner Graham Doyle.

An interesting report published by the nonprofit watch group Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) estimates that Grok generated around 3 million sexualized images in just 11 days after X launched its image-editing feature, an average of about 190 per minute. Among them, roughly 23,000 appeared to depict children, or one every 41 seconds, plus another 9,900 cartoon sexualized images of minors. Researchers found that 29% of identified child images remained publicly accessible, highlighting the scale and speed of the content spread.

Amnesty International reports that in May 2024, Intellexa’s Predator spyware infected the iPhone of Teixeira Cândido, an Angolan journalist and press freedom advocate, after he opened a malicious link sent via WhatsApp. This incident highlights how attackers actively target journalists for surveillance.

Predator is a powerful mobile spyware by Intellexa, sold to governments for surveillance. Investigations over five years documented abuses worldwide, despite Intellexa rebranding and shifting its corporate structure. The Angola case marks the first confirmed Predator attack there, showing the spyware remained active through 2025. Amnesty International and partners exposed Intellexa’s operations, but the responsible customers remain unknown.

Since 2022, Angolan journalist Teixeira Cândido faced multiple attacks and break-ins, raising suspicions of surveillance. From April to June 2024, an attacker posing as students sent him WhatsApp messages to gain his trust, eventually sending malicious links. On 4 May 2024, he clicked one link, infecting his iPhone with Intellexa’s Predator spyware. Once installed, the spyware gave attackers full access to his device, including messages, calls, emails, location, camera, microphone, passwords, and other sensitive data, illustrating a targeted and highly invasive surveillance operation.

“Through forensic analysis of the links and associated domain names, Amnesty International’s Security Lab determined with high confidence that all the links sent to Teixeira Cândido to this WhatsApp number were attempts to infect his phone with the Predator spyware. All infection domains matched a network fingerprint used to track Intellexa infection servers.” reads the report published by Amnesty International. “On 4 May 2024, one day after the first Predator infection link was received (Figure 4), Teixeira Cândido appears to have opened the infection link received, which would have resulted in the successful infection of the journalist’s phone with the Predator spyware.

On 4 May 2024, Amnesty International confirmed Predator spyware ran on Teixeira Cândido’s iPhone, executing from the directory /private/var/containers/Bundle/ under the name “iconservicesagent” to impersonate a system process.

His device ran the outdated iOS 16.2, potentially exposing it to known exploits, though Intellexa could also use zero-day vulnerabilities. The spyware remained active less than a day, but attackers sent 11 further malicious WhatsApp links through mid-June 2024. Forensic traces, network activity, and infection domains confirm this attack as Predator.

Amnesty International’s research shows Intellexa’s Predator spyware has targeted Angola since at least early 2023, with the attack on journalist Teixeira Cândido representing just part of broader activity. Predator communicates with spyware servers via domain names, many in Portuguese, revealing a regional focus. Technical analysis linked the domains used against Cândido to Predator, with earlier Angola-linked domains dating back to March 2023. Predator grants total access to devices, making independent audits nearly impossible.

Amnesty considers such spyware fundamentally incompatible with human rights. The Angola attack violates journalists’ rights to privacy and free expression, chilling civil society in a context of growing authoritarianism under President João Lourenço. Amnesty’s inquiries to Intellexa about its role and access to customer systems remain unanswered, raising concerns over the company’s legal and ethical responsibility in these abuses.

“While it remains unclear if Intellexa could access the specific Angolan deployment in 2024, the finding from Intellexa Leaks that the company had potential visibility into active surveillance operations of their customers, including seeing technical information about the targets, raises new legal questions about Intellexa’s role in relation to the spyware and the company’s potential legal or criminal responsibility for unlawful surveillance operations carried out using their products.” concludes the report. “This new case of spyware use against a journalist in Angola makes clear – yet again – that the unchecked sale and use of surveillance technologies continue to facilitate human rights abuses at a global scale. “

[21] Security Affairs - French Ministry confirms data access to 1.2 Million bank accounts
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Link: https://securityaffairs.com/188200/hacking/french-ministry-confirms-data-access-to-1-2-million-bank-accounts.html

[TAM METİN - 318 kelime]
A hacker gained access to data from 1.2 million French bank accounts using stolen credentials belonging to a government official, according to the French Economy Ministry. French authorities said affected account holders will be notified in the coming days.

“The French Economy Ministry said on Wednesday, February 18, that a hacker gained access to a national bank account database and consulted information on 1.2 million accounts.” reports French daily newspaper LeMonde. “Since the end of January, the hacker used the stolen credentials of an official to access and consult “parts of the file of all of the accounts open in French banks and which contains personal data such as bank account numbers, name of the account holder, address and in certain cases the account owner’s tax number,” the ministry said in a statement.”

France’s Public Finances chief said the security breach did not allow access to account balances or transactions. After detecting the intrusion, the ministry immediately blocked the threat actor and acted to prevent any data from being removed.

Authorities filed a criminal complaint and notified the CNIL, France’s data protection authority, about the incident.

The Economy Ministry has not yet disclosed the hacker’s motivation. It remains unclear whether the attacker is a nation-state actor or a cybercriminal.

In December, a major cyber incident knocked offline the information systems at the French national postal service La Poste. The attack disrupted digital banking and online services for millions of customers.

The outage followed another cyberattack on France’s Interior Ministry, where a suspected hacker accessed sensitive police data; a 22-year-old was detained. The French Interior Minister Laurent Nunez announced that threat actors compromised email servers at the Ministry of the Interior.

The attack was detected overnight between December 11 and 12, and according to the French interior minister, attackers gained access to some document files, though data theft remains unconfirmed.

[22] Security Affairs - Notepad++ patches flaw used to hijack update system
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Wed, 18 Feb 2026 19:28:02 +0000
Link: https://securityaffairs.com/188192/hacking/notepad-patches-flaw-used-to-hijack-update-system.html

[TAM METİN - 822 kelime]
Notepad++ fixed a vulnerability that allowed a China-linked APT group to hijack its update mechanism and selectively push malware to chosen targets.

In early February, the Notepad++ maintainer revealed that nation-state hackers compromised the hosting provider’s infrastructure, redirecting update traffic to malicious servers. The attack did not exploit flaws in Notepad++ code but intercepted updates before they reached users.

“According to the analysis provided by the security experts, the attack involved infrastructure-level compromise that allowed malicious actors to intercept and redirect update traffic destined for notepad-plus-plus.org.” reads the advisory published by the software maintainers. “The exact technical mechanism remains under investigation, though the compromise occured at the hosting provider level rather than through vulnerabilities in Notepad++ code itself. Traffic from certain targeted users was selectively redirected to attacker-controlled served malicious update manifests.”

The incident began in June 2025 and was linked by multiple researchers to a likely Chinese state-sponsored group, based on its highly selective targeting. Attackers compromised a shared hosting server until September 2, 2025, and later used stolen internal credentials to redirect Notepad++ update traffic to malicious servers until December 2.

The hosting provider moved all affected customers to a new server, fixed the vulnerabilities that were abused, and rotated all credentials that may have been exposed.

After completing these actions, the provider reviewed system logs and confirmed there was no evidence of continued attacker access or malicious activity.

The security expert found the attack ended on November 10, 2025, while the hosting provider reported possible attacker access until December 2. Combining both assessments, the compromise likely lasted from June to December 2, 2025.

Rapid7 Labs and its MDR team uncovered a sophisticated campaign tied to the China-linked APT Lotus Blossom. Active since 2009, the group runs targeted espionage against government, telecom, aviation, critical infrastructure, and media organizations, mainly in Southeast Asia and Central America. The investigation traced a compromise of Notepad++ hosting infrastructure used to deploy a new custom backdoor, dubbed Chrysalis, along with stealthy loaders that abuse Microsoft Warbird to conceal malicious code execution.

“Our investigation identified a security incident stemming from a sophisticated compromise of the infrastructure hosting Notepad++, which was subsequently used to deliver a previously undocumented custom backdoor, which we have dubbed Chrysalis.” reads the report published by Rapid7.

Rapid7’s MDR team traced the initial access to the abuse of Notepad++ distribution infrastructure. Investigators saw notepad++.exe and GUP.exe run first, followed by a suspicious update.exe downloaded from an external IP. That file turned out to be an NSIS installer, a delivery method often used by Chinese APT groups. It dropped files into a hidden AppData folder and abused DLL sideloading through a renamed Bitdefender binary to decrypt and launch a custom backdoor called Chrysalis.

“Shortly after the execution of BluetoothService.exe, which is actually a renamed legitimate Bitdefender Submission Wizard abused for DLL sideloading, a malicious log.dll was placed alongside the executable, causing it to be loaded instead of the legitimate library.” continues the report. “Two exported functions from log.dll are called by Bitdefender Submission Wizard: LogInit and LogWrite.”

The malware relied on multiple layers of obfuscation to conceal its code and make analysis harder. It used custom API hashing to avoid calling Windows functions directly and encrypted its configuration to hide key settings. After running, it set up persistence to survive reboots, collected detailed information about the infected system, and connected to a remote command-and-control server. Through this connection, attackers could run commands, move files, and take full control of compromised machines.

Chrysalis supports full remote control, including command execution, file transfer, and interactive shells. Investigators also uncovered related loaders abusing Metasploit shellcode, Cobalt Strike beacons, and even Microsoft Warbird protections, showing long-term development and a complex, multi-stage attack chain.

Researchers attribute the campaign to Lotus Blossom based on strong overlaps with prior Symantec research, including a renamed Bitdefender tool used to sideload log.dll, similar loader chains, and shared Cobalt Strike public keys across multiple samples.

Notepad++ version 8.9.2 addressed the issue by introducing a “double lock” update system that verifies both the signed installer from GitHub and the signed XML from its update server to prevent abuse.

“This “double lock” design makes the Notepad++ update process robust and effectively unexploitable.” wrote the maintainer.

The release also strengthens the WinGUp auto-updater by removing libcurl.dll to block DLL side-loading, disabling insecure SSL options, and restricting plugin execution to programs signed with the same certificate.

Version 8.9.2 also addressed an Unsafe Search Path vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2026-25926 (CVSS score of 7.3), that could result in arbitrary code execution in the context of the running application.

“An Unsafe Search Path vulnerability (CWE-426) exists when launching Windows Explorer without an absolute executable path.” reads the advisory. “This may allow execution of a malicious explorer.exe if an attacker can control the process working directory. Under certain conditions, this could lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the running application.”

[23] Security Affairs - VS Code extensions with 125M+ installs expose users to cyberattacks
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Link: https://securityaffairs.com/188185/security/vs-code-extensions-with-125m-installs-expose-users-to-cyberattacks.html

[TAM METİN - 394 kelime]
OX Security researchers warn that security flaws in four widely used VS Code extensions (Live Server, Code Runner, Markdown Preview Enhanced, and Microsoft Live Preview) could allow attackers to steal local files and execute code remotely. These extensions have been installed over 125 million times, putting many users at risk.

“The OX Security Research team found vulnerabilities in four popular VS Code extensions (later confirmed on Cursor and Windsurf). Three were assigned CVEs – CVE-2025-65715, CVE-2025-65716, and CVE-2025-65717 – totaling over 120 million downloads and posing a significant threat to developers worldwide.” reads the report published by OX Security. “Our research demonstrates that a hacker needs only one malicious extension, or a single vulnerability within one extension, to perform lateral movement and compromise entire organizations.“

IDE extensions act like mini-admins with broad access to users’ systems. If users install poorly designed or malicious extensions, attackers can run code, modify files, and take over their machines. Opening a project or clicking a file can let attackers move laterally, steal data, and gain full control, putting sensitive information at high risk.

Researchers disclosed three vulnerabilities in July–August 2025 but received no response from the maintainers, despite reaching out via email, GitHub, and social media. Months of disclosure attempts went unanswered, highlighting a systemic issue: extension security lacks accountability and incentives for timely fixes.

The experts remark that current “install at your own risk” model is no longer safe. Solutions include mandatory security reviews before publishing, AI-powered vulnerability scanning, and enforceable maintainer response rules. As AI coding assistants speed development and reliance on extensions grows, securing developer tools must start at the source.

The experts recommend users should avoid opening untrusted HTML while localhost servers run and avoid running unnecessary servers. They should never paste or run unverified snippets in global settings.json. Users must install only trusted extensions, monitor or back up settings.json, disable or remove non-essential extensions, harden local networks with firewalls, and promptly apply security updates to IDEs, extensions, OS, and development dependencies.

“The vulnerabilities discovered in these widely adopted VS Code extensions – collectively downloaded over 128 million times – expose a critical blind spot in modern development security.” concludes the report. “While organizations invest heavily in securing production environments, the developer’s local machine remains a largely unprotected gateway to an organization’s most sensitive assets.”

[24] Security Affairs - China-linked APT weaponized Dell RecoverPoint zero-day since 2024
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Wed, 18 Feb 2026 12:15:46 +0000

[TAM METİN - 478 kelime]
Mandiant and Google’s Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) reported that a suspected China-linked APT group quietly exploited a critical zero-day flaw in Dell RecoverPoint for Virtual Machines starting in mid-2024.

“Mandiant and Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) have identified the zero-day exploitation of a high-risk vulnerability in Dell RecoverPoint for Virtual Machines, tracked as CVE-2026-22769, with a CVSSv3.1 score of 10.0.” reads the report published by Google. “Analysis of incident response engagements revealed that UNC6201, a suspected PRC-nexus threat cluster, has exploited this flaw since at least mid-2024 to move laterally, maintain persistent access, and deploy malware including SLAYSTYLE, BRICKSTORM, and a novel backdoor tracked as GRIMBOLT.”

The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2026-22769, involves hardcoded credentials and was abused to gain access to VMware backup systems.

“Dell RecoverPoint for Virtual Machines, versions prior to 6.0.3.1 HF1, contain a hardcoded credential vulnerability. This is considered critical as an unauthenticated remote attacker with knowledge of the hardcoded credential could potentially exploit this vulnerability leading to unauthorized access to the underlying operating system and root-level persistence. Dell recommends that customers upgrade or apply one of the remediations as soon as possible.” reads the advisory published by Dell.”Dell has received a report from Google/Mandiant of limited active exploitation of this vulnerability. Dell strongly recommends that customers apply one of the remediations below to address this vulnerability as soon as possible.”

The China-nexus group exploited the bug to move laterally, maintain persistence, and deploy malware such as SLAYSTYLE, BRICKSTORM, and a new C# backdoor, GRIMBOLT. Researchers observed advanced tactics, including stealthy VMware pivoting via “Ghost NICs” and Single Packet Authorization with iptables. Dell has released patches and mitigation guidance.

During investigations into compromised Dell RecoverPoint appliances, Mandiant researchers discovered that attackers replaced BRICKSTORM with a new C# backdoor, GRIMBOLT, in September 2025. GRIMBOLT is compiled using Native AOT and packed with UPX. The malware provides remote shell access and reuses BRICKSTORM’s command-and-control channels.

“It provides a remote shell capability and uses the same command and control as previously deployed BRICKSTORM payload.” continues the report. “It’s unclear if the threat actor’s replacement of BRICKSTORM with GRIMBOLT was part of a pre-planned life cycle iteration by the threat actor or a reaction to incident response efforts led by Mandiant and other industry partners.”

The attackers ensured persistence by modifying a legitimate startup script so the backdoor runs automatically at boot.

While investigating compromised Dell RecoverPoint systems, Mandiant uncovered CVE-2026-22769 after spotting Tomcat Manager access using hardcoded admin credentials. Attackers uploaded a malicious WAR file containing the SLAYSTYLE web shell, gaining root command execution as early as mid-2024. The group also expanded into VMware environments, creating “Ghost NICs” for stealthy lateral movement and using iptables-based Single Packet Authorization to covertly redirect and control traffic on vCenter appliances.

Google released Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) and Yara rules for this campaign.

[TAM METİN - 506 kelime]
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) added Google Chromium CSS, Microsoft Windows, TeamT5 ThreatSonar Anti-Ransomware, and Zimbra flaws to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog.

The first flaw added to the catalog is CVE-2026-2441, which is a Use after free in CSS component in Google Chrome prior to 145.0.7632.75. This week, Google released urgent security updates to address this high-severity zero-day vulnerability. This is the first actively exploited Chrome zero-day fixed in 2026, after eight similar flaws were patched in 2025.

An attacker could exploit the flaw to compromise affected systems. The issue was discovered and responsibly reported by security researcher Shaheen Fazim on February 11, 2026.

“CVE-2026-2441: Use after free in CSS. Reported by Shaheen Fazim on 2026-02-11.” reads the Google’s advisory. “Google is aware that an exploit for CVE-2026-2441 exists in the wild.”

Google has confirmed that an exploit for CVE-2026-2441 exists in the wild, but has not shared details about how it is being used or which threat actor is behind the exploitation of the flaw.

The second flaw, tracked as CVE-2024-7694, impacts TeamT5 ThreatSonar Anti-Ransomware. The issue is an arbitrary file upload vulnerability due to improper validation of uploaded content. An authenticated attacker with administrator privileges can upload crafted malicious files to the platform. This may allow arbitrary system command execution on the server, potentially leading to full system compromise, data exposure, and disruption of security functions.

The third flaw added to the catalog, tracked as CVE-2020-7796, impacts Zimbra Collaboration Suite (ZCS) before 8.8.15 Patch 7. The issue is an SSRF that can be exploited if the WebEx Zimlet is installed and its JSP component is enabled. An attacker can trick the server into making unauthorized outbound requests, potentially accessing internal services or sensitive resources. In March 2025, Threat intelligence firm GreyNoise observed Grafana path traversal exploitation attempts before the Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) surge on March 9, suggesting that attackers may be leveraging Grafana as an initial entry point for deeper exploitation. One of the vulnerabilities exploited in the attacks observed by the experts is CVE-2020-7796. Most Server-Side Request Forgery exploitation attempts targeted entities in the United States, Germany, Singapore, India, Lithuania, Japan, and Israel.

The experts warned that attackers leverage SSRF for pivoting and reconnaissance and cloud exploitation.

The last flaw added to the catalog, tracked as CVE-2008-0015, is a stack-based buffer overflow in the in CComVariant::ReadFromStream within ATL, used by the MPEG2TuneRequest ActiveX control (msvidctl.dll) in DirectShow, affects multiple legacy Windows versions. A crafted web page can trigger remote code execution. The flaw was exploited in the wild in July 2009.

According to Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities, FCEB agencies have to address the identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect their networks against attacks exploiting the flaws in the catalog.

Experts also recommend that private organizations review the Catalog and address the vulnerabilities in their infrastructure.

CISA orders federal agencies to fix the vulnerabilities by March 10, 2026.

Could America turn off Europe’s internet?

That’s one of the questions that Graham and special guest James Ball will be exploring as they discuss tech sovereignty.  Could Gmail, cloud services, and critical infrastructure really become geopolitical leverage? And is anyone actually building a Plan B?

Plus we explore if Meta is quietly plotting to turn its smart glasses into face-recognising surveillance specs? With reports of internal memos suggesting they plan to launch controversial features while everyone’s distracted by political chaos, we ask: is this innovation really wanted by the public… or something far creepier?

All of this, and much more, in episode 455 of the award-winning “Smashing Security” podcast with cybersecurity veteran Graham Cluley, joined this week by journalist and author James Ball.

[27] Recorded Future - GrayCharlie Hijacks Law Firm Sites in Suspected Supply-Chain Attack

GrayCharlie Hijacks Law Firm Sites in Suspected Supply-Chain Attack

Insikt Group has been monitoring GrayCharlie, a threat actor overlapping with SmartApeSG and active since mid-2023, for some time, and is now publishing its first report on the group. GrayCharlie compromises WordPress sites and injects them with links to externally hosted JavaScript that redirects visitors to NetSupport RAT payloads delivered via fake browser update pages or ClickFix mechanisms. These infections often progress to the deployment of Stealc and SectopRAT. Insikt Group identified a large amount of infrastructure linked to GrayCharlie, primarily tied to MivoCloud and HZ Hosting Ltd. This includes NetSupport RAT command-and-control (C2) servers, both actor-controlled and compromised staging infrastructure, and higher-tier infrastructure used to administer operations. While most compromised websites appear to be opportunistic and span numerous industries, Insikt Group identified a cluster of United States (US) law firm sites that were likely compromised around November 2025, possibly through a supply-chain compromise involving a shared IT provider.

To protect against GrayCharlie, security defenders should block IP addresses and domains tied to associated remote access trojans (RATs) and infostealers, flag and potentially block connections to compromised websites, and deploy updated detection rules (YARA, Snort, Sigma) for current and historical infections. Other controls include implementing email filtering and data exfiltration monitoring. See the Mitigations section of this report for implementation guidance and Appendix A for a complete list of indicators of compromise (IoCs).

GrayCharlie, which overlaps with SmartApeSG and first emerged in mid-2023, is a threat actor that injects links to externally hosted JavaScript into compromised WordPress sites. These links redirect victims to NetSupport RAT infections delivered via fake browser update pages or ClickFix techniques, ultimately resulting in Stealc and SectopRAT infections.

Insikt Group identified a wide range of GrayCharlie infrastructure, largely associated with MivoCloud and HZ Hosting Ltd. This includes NetSupport RAT command-and-control (C2) servers, staging infrastructure made up of both actor-controlled and compromised infrastructure, as well as components of GrayCharlie’s higher-tier infrastructure used to manage its operations.

Insikt Group identified two primary attack chains associated with GrayCharlie: one in which victims encounter fake browser update pages after visiting compromised websites, and another in which they are presented with a ClickFix pop-up, a technique that has become increasingly common in 2025.

GrayCharlie is Insikt Group’s designation for a threat activity group that first appeared in mid-2023 and is behind SmartApeSG, also referred to as ZPHP or HANEYMANEY. The group’s operations typically involve injecting malicious JavaScript into legitimate but compromised WordPress sites. Visitors to these sites are shown convincing, browser-specific fake update prompts (such as for Chrome, Edge, or Firefox) that encourage them to download what appears to be an update but is actually malware.

In late March or early April 2025, SmartApeSG shifted from using fake browser updates to deploying ClickFix lures, mirroring a broader trend among threat actors of increasingly adopting ClickFix.

GrayCharlie predominantly delivers NetSupport RAT; however, deployments of Stealc and, more recently, SectopRAT, have been observed in rare instances. The group’s ultimate objectives remain uncertain. Current evidence suggests a focus on data theft and financial gain, with a theoretical, but unsubstantiated, possibility that it may sell or transfer access to other threat actors.

Insikt Group has been tracking GrayCharlie for an extended period and has observed the actor’s persistent behavior since its emergence in 2023. GrayCharlie continues to conduct the same types of operations, regularly deploying large volumes of new infrastructure and adhering to consistent tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), including continued use of the same infection chains and NetSupport RAT payloads. The group targets organizations worldwide, with a particular focus on the US. The following sections provide a detailed examination of GrayCharlie’s operational infrastructure and its two primary attack chains.

Infrastructure Analysis

Insikt Group identified two main NetSupport RAT clusters linked to GrayCharlie based on factors such as TLS certificates, NetSupport serial numbers and license keys, and the timing of the activity (see Figure 1). In addition, Insikt Group identified a range of other NetSupport RAT C2 servers linked to GrayCharlie activity, but which are not currently attributed to either of the two main clusters. Insikt Group assesses that these clusters may correspond either to different individuals associated with GrayCharlie or to distinct GrayCharlie campaigns. The clusters are further described below.

Cluster 1 comprises NetSupport RAT C2 servers whose TLS certificates display a recurring monthly naming pattern. All servers in this cluster are hosted by MivoCloud and were deployed between March and August 2025. Notably, NetSupport RAT samples associated with the cluster’s March and April infrastructure used the license key DCVTTTUUEEW23 and serial number NSM896597, before shifting to the license key EVALUSION and serial number NSM165348 in subsequent deployments. The C2 servers associated with this cluster are listed in Table 1.

Table 1: NetSupport RAT C2 servers linked to Cluster 1 (Source: Recorded Future)

Notably, the NetSupport RAT C2 servers in Cluster 1 are connected not only through the characteristics previously described, but also by the near-simultaneous creation of their TLS certificates. For example, the TLS certificate with the common name june5ebatquot associated with IP address 94[.]158[.]245[.]135 was generated on June 30, 2025 at 4:55:20 PM, while the certificate with the common name june6 linked to 94[.]158[.]245[.]174 was created only 20 seconds later.

Cluster 2 comprises NetSupport RAT command-and-control servers whose TLS certificates typically start with two or more repetitions of “s”, followed by an “i” and a number (so “sssi3”, for example). NetSupport RAT samples linked to Cluster 2 used the license key XMLCTL and serial number NSM303008. The NetSupport RAT C2 servers typically also host an instance of the vulnerability scanner Acunetix. The C2 servers associated with this cluster are listed in Table 2. Notably, all TLS certificates associated with this cluster were created in a single batch on June 17, 2025.

Table 2: NetSupport RAT C2 servers linked to Cluster 2 (Source: Recorded Future)

Of note, one NetSupport RAT C2 server (94[.]158[.]245[.]56) used a TLS certificate with the common name 23sss, created in May 2025, and was linked to a NetSupport RAT sample that carried the same license key (EVALUSION) and serial number (NSM165348) previously observed in Cluster 1.

Insikt Group identified an additional set of NetSupport RAT C2 servers linked to GrayCharlie that did not form a distinct cluster (see Table 3). However, all the servers were hosted by MivoCloud and were associated with NetSupport RAT samples using license key and serial number combinations observed in Clusters 1 and 2.

Once GrayCharlie victims land on the compromised WordPress sites, thereby satisfying the conditional logic, the payload is typically fetched from the attacker-controlled infrastructure and injected into the compromised WordPress sites. Insikt Group has identified two distinct types of staging infrastructure, each characterized by different website templates. Type 1 is modeled after “Wiser University,” and Type 2 is modeled after “Activitar.”

The IP addresses associated with the Type 1 staging infrastructure are linked to websites impersonating “Wiser University” (see Figure 2), a fictional entity used to demonstrate Wiser, a free Bootstrap HTML5 education website template for school, college, and university websites. (As a sidenote, Oreshnik is the name of a Russian intermediate-range ballistic missile reportedly capable of speeds exceeding Mach 10.) Appendix B lists the IP addresses associated with the Type 1 staging infrastructure. All IP addresses, except for one, are announced by AS202015 (HZ Hosting Ltd).

Although most IP addresses associated with the Type 1 staging infrastructure are announced by AS202015, as shown in Appendix B, Insikt Group also identified a small subset announced by other ASNs that host the same websites (see Table 4). On average, approximately one such IP address appears to be established each month. Notably, most of these IP addresses appear to geolocate to Russia, and the same ASNs are consistently reused within the same timeframe.

Table 4: Additional infrastructure possibly linked to GrayCharlie (Source: Recorded Future)

Insikt Group identified an additional set of staging infrastructure, referred to as “Type 2.” The IP addresses in this cluster commonly host specific websites (see Figure 3). Insikt Group assesses that this template was sourced elsewhere and is not unique to GrayCharlie.

A subset of domains and IP addresses associated with Type 2 is presented in Table 5. Notably, most of the IP addresses are also announced by AS202015 (HZ Hosting Ltd), and one domain in Table 5, filmlerzltyazilimsx[.]shop, is linked to the email address oreshnik[@]mailum[.]com through its WHOIS record.

Table 5: Domains and IP addresses linked to Type 2 staging infrastructure (Source: Recorded Future)

GrayCharlie commonly injects malicious scripts into the Document Object Model (DOM) of compromised WordPress sites using script tags. Insikt Group has identified several recurring URL patterns tied to this activity: some URLs load externally hosted JavaScript files (such as hxxps://joiner[.]best/work/original[.]js), while others call a PHP file on specific endpoints using an ID parameter (such as hxxps://signaturepl[.]com/work/index[.]php?abje2LAw). Notably, these URLs are updated over time by the threat actor, complicating detection and indicating the threat actor maintains ongoing access to a large pool of compromised WordPress installations. Appendix A lists a subset of WordPress websites infected by GrayCharlie.

Although the exact initial access vector is unknown, it is likely that the actors either purchase access, such as via malware logs containing WordPress admin credentials, or exploit vulnerable WordPress plugins. The latter remains the most frequent cause of all WordPress compromises.

While the GrayCharlie-linked compromised WordPress sites span a wide range of industry verticals, in a few rare instances, the threat actors appear to have obtained, either through their own intrusions or via a third party, a more targeted set of WordPress domains. Specifically, at least fifteen websites belonging to US law firms were observed loading the external JavaScript hosted at hxxps://persistancejs[.]store/work/original[.]js (see Table 6).

Insikt Group assesses that GrayCharlie (or the third party GrayCharlie works with) likely compromised these websites through a supply-chain vector. One potential avenue is SMB Team, the self-described “fastest-growing law firm acceleration company,” which has supported thousands of firms across North America, according to its website, as its logo and other references appear across many of the websites listed in Table 6 (see Figure 4). Notably, credentials associated with an SMB Team email address used for a WordPress hosting platform surfaced around the same time that the domain persistancejs[.]store first began resolving. This temporal overlap suggests that the threat actors may have gained access to SMB Team-related infrastructure through the use of legitimate, compromised credentials.

Table 6: Compromised law firm websites linked to GrayCharlie (Source: Recorded Future)

Notably, while an SMB Team compromise is possible, Insikt Group also assesses that the actors may have exploited a specific version of WordPress or its plugins used by SMB Team, which could explain the simultaneous compromise of all affected websites.

In some instances, the same compromised WordPress sites are compromised by multiple threat actors simultaneously. For example, bianchilawgroup[.]com was also breached by TAG-124 (also known as LandUpdate808 or Kongtuke) since at least December 2025, which used the domain vimsltd[.]com.

GrayCharlie administers its staging infrastructure primarily over SSH, though other ports are used intermittently. The group manages its NetSupport RAT C2 servers over TCP port 443. Overall, Insikt Group assesses that GrayCharlie relies extensively on proxy services to administer its infrastructure. Additionally, based on presumed browsing activity from higher-tier servers, at least some individuals linked to GrayCharlie are assessed to be Russian-speaking.

Attack-Chain Analysis

GrayCharlie has been observed using two different attack chains to deliver NetSupport RAT. The first chain uses compromised websites to distribute a fake browser update that triggers the retrieval and installation of a script-based payload; the second chain uses compromised WordPress sites and a ClickFix-style lure that copies a command to fetch and install the RAT. Both culminate in NetSupport execution from %AppData%, Registry Run key persistence, and C2 connectivity; the technical details are expanded below.

According to public reporting, when GrayCharlie first became active in mid-2023, it relied on fake browser updates to deliver the NetSupport RAT. Although the group later shifted to the ClickFix technique, Insikt Group observed a return to fake browser updates as early as October 12, 2025. Figure 5 provides an overview of Attack Chain 1.

Website compromise and lure delivery. Threat actors modify legitimate sites to load malicious scripts that render a browser-specific “update” prompt. Selecting the prompt initiates download of a ZIP “update” package containing a primary JavaScript file alongside decoy .dat files.

User-executed JavaScript loader. The victim manually runs the .js script. The script mimics a benign browser component to reduce suspicion while silently initiating the next stage of the attack.

PowerShell staging via WScript. The JavaScript launches wscript.exe, which spawns powershell.exe. PowerShell reaches out to a remote host to fetch an obfuscated JavaScript containing encoded tasking.

Secondary payload retrieval. PowerShell decodes instructions and downloads the actual payload ZIP archive. This archive contains a complete NetSupport RAT client set, including client32.exe and required DLLs.

File deployment and execution. The archive is extracted under the user profile (for example, %AppData%\Roaming\...). client32.exe is started in the background to minimize visible indicators to the user.

Persistence establishment. A Windows Run registry key is created to automatically launch client32.exe at logon, ensuring the NetSupport RAT remains active after reboots without requiring further user interaction.

C2 readiness. With the NetSupport RAT client running on the infected host, the endpoint is prepared to establish command-and-control connectivity with the attacker's infrastructure.

As early as April 2025, GrayCharlie began using ClickFix as a secondary attack chain, consistent with industry reporting that many threat actors have adopted ClickFix techniques due to their effectiveness. Figure 6 provides an overview of Attack Chain 2.

Initial delivery and redirection. Phishing emails, malicious PDFs, or links on gaming sites direct users to compromised WordPress pages that embed attacker JavaScript.

Background script and profiling. A background script loads when the site is visited, injects an iframe, and profiles the environment (such as the operating system and browser) to deliver the next stage.

ClickFix fake CAPTCHA. The page presents a fake CAPTCHA that quietly copies a malicious command to the user’s clipboard and instructs them to paste it into the Windows Run dialog (Win+R), turning social engineering into user-assisted execution (see Figure 7).

Command-driven staging. The pasted command retrieves a batch file that downloads a ZIP containing NetSupport RAT and uses PowerShell to extract it into %AppData%\Roaming\ (see Figure 8).

Figure 8: PowerShell command (Source: Cybereason)

NetSupport RAT launch and persistence. The batch file starts client32.exe and sets a Run registry key to automatically relaunch the NetSupport RAT client at startup, establishing persistence on the endpoint.

Remote access and follow-on actions. Once connected to C2, operators can interact with the system, perform reconnaissance (for example, domain group membership queries), transfer files, execute additional commands, and potentially move laterally using access acquired from the host.

Observed Operator Activity

In October 2025, Insikt Group detonated a NetSupport RAT sample (SHA256: 31804c48f9294c9fa7c165c89e487bfbebeda6daf3244ad30b93122bf933c79c) with the C2 server 5[.]181[.]156[.]234[:]443 linked to GrayCharlie within a controlled environment. Later that day, approximately three hours later, the threat actor connected using NetSupport RAT, compressed and moved two files, and then executed group and account reconnaissance commands. The same actor returned three days later and repeated the previously observed reconnaissance commands (see Figure 9).

Figure 9: Reconnaissance commands (Source: Recorded Future)

When both files were compressed into a single ZIP archive and the executable was detonated, the process sideloaded a DLL identified as Sectop RAT (SHA256: 59e7e7698d77531bfbfea4739d29c14e188b5d3109f63881b9bcc87c72e9de78) with the C2 server 85[.]158[.]110[.]179[:]15847. The executable (SHA256: 5f1bd92ad6edea67762c7101cb810dc28fd861f7b8c62e6459226b7ea54e1428) was identified as “Merge XML Files”, version 1.2.0.0, developed by Vovsoft, and was signed with a digital certificate that expired on October 31, 2025.

[28] Cyberscoop - Nigerian man sentenced to 8 years in prison for running phony tax refund scheme

[TAM METİN - 529 kelime]
A 37-year-old Nigerian man was sentenced to eight years in prison for participating in a five-year cybercrime spree to steal money from the U.S. government through fraudulent tax returns, the Justice Department said Wednesday.

Matthew Abiodun Akande was living in Mexico when he and at least four co-conspirators broke into the networks of tax preparation firms, stole sensitive data on their clients and filed fraudulent tax returns, claiming tax refunds with victims’ personal data, according to court records.

Akande and his co-conspirators filed more than 1,000 fraudulent tax returns seeking more than $8.1 million in phony tax refunds during a five-year period ending in June 2021, prosecutors said. The crew collectively obtained more than $1.3 million in fraudulent tax refunds.

Officials said Akande also advanced the scheme by sending phishing emails to five Massachusetts-based tax preparation firms that were designed to trick employees into downloading remote access trojan malware, including Warzone RAT. Four of those firms were listed as victims in the indictment.

Akande has been in detention since he was arrested at Heathrow Airport in the United Kingdom in October 2024 and extradited to the United States in March 2025. A month later, Akande pleaded guilty to all 33 counts in the indictment prosecutors filed against him in July 2022.

His crimes include conspiracy to obtain unauthorized access to protected computers, wire fraud, unauthorized access to protected computers, theft of government money, and aggravated identity theft.

Akande and his alleged co-conspirators — Kehinde Hussein Oyetunji, a Nigerian national living in North Dakota, and two people that prosecutors declined to name — directed the fraudulent tax refunds to be deposited in U.S. bank accounts. Co-conspirators living in the United States withdrew some of the stolen money in cash then, at Akande’s direction, transferred a portion of the funds to third parties in Mexico, officials said.

In a sentencing memo submitted to the court, Akande’s lawyer insisted his client was not living an extravagant lifestyle in Mexico. Yet, he was ordered to pay almost $1.4 million in restitution as part of his sentencing.

[29] Cyberscoop - Fulton County lawsuit claims feds used ‘gross mischaracterizations’ to justify raid
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Wed, 18 Feb 2026 15:59:15 +0000
Link: https://cyberscoop.com/fulton-county-election-raid-expert-testimony-ryan-macias/

[TAM METİN - 784 kelime]
A former federal official who tested and certified voting machines used in Fulton County, Georgia for the 2020 presidential election told a court that the federal government misrepresented key facts and omitted exculpatory public evidence while seeking a warrant in last month’s law enforcement raid.

The raid, carried out by the FBI and overseen by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, saw agents seize ballots and other documentation from the Fulton County election offices. A public affidavit cited five core allegations related to the county’s recordkeeping, electronic ballot image storage,  and election night reporting. Authorities allege these issues point to a potential conspiracy to intentionally manipulate the vote count in favor of Democrat Joe Biden.

Fulton County officials sued the federal government in response, arguing that the affidavit used to obtain a warrant for the raid “does not identify facts that establish probable cause that anyone committed a crime.”

Another filing includes sworn testimony from Ryan Macias, an elections expert who tested and certified the county’s voting machines while at the Election Assistance Commission. In his testimony, Macias told the court that the government’s key claims have already been investigated and have been found to be baseless.

He said the FBI’s “many individual omissions and misstatements” in its affidavit reflect “gross mischaracterizations” of how elections work and directly contradict the conclusions of multiple prior investigations into the Nov. 2020 election in Fulton County.

“Once the statements and omissions in the Affidavit are corrected and based on my experience administering elections, the Affidavit does not have a substantial basis in reality,” Macias stated.

For instance, the FBI’s affidavit cites the absence of scanned images of all 527,925 ballots for the original count and recount. But Macias, who served as an adviser to Fulton County and witnessed pre and post-election operations in 2020, said this was standard practice.  Jurisdictions typically send only the vote count records from their machines on election night, because ballot images and audit logs are much larger files that can slow down the reporting process.

Macias also notes that the FBI affidavit omits that this issue was already investigated by Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who found Georgia election workers weren’t required by law to preserve such images until a state law passed in 2021.

An investigator from Raffensperger’s office later told the Board of Elections that “it was “important to note that ballots can be scanned and tabulated without capturing ballot images,” while general counsel Charlene McGowan testified that ballot images play no role in the vote tabulation process and Fulton County’s paper ballots – counted three times – were the “most important” documents to verify the count.

“These explanations about the storing of ballot images have been publicly available for some time,” Macias noted.

Similarly, the FBI cites instances where some Fulton County ballots were scanned multiple times, claiming it shows evidence of “an intentional tabulation of ballots in a false matter” to make the recount and original vote counts match. The bureau also pointed to small, non-determinative differences between the county’s machine recount and totals from a hand-counted risk-limiting audit.

But the federal government again failed to mention in its petition for a warrant that these claims were “exhaustively” investigated by the Secretary of State’s office, which found the errors were benign, the duplicates weren’t counted, and did not impact the final vote count in the state’s count of the 2020 presidential contest.

According to Macias, the government’s affidavit also contains errors about basic facts about Fulton County’s reporting process. This includes misreporting the correct official vote count and the date and time it was transmitted to state officials for tabulation.

Adidas investigates third-party data breach after criminals claim they pwned the sportswear giant

'Potential data protection incident' at an 'independent licensing partner,' we're told

Adidas has confirmed it is investigating a third-party breach at one of its partner companies after digital thieves claimed they stole information and technical data from the German sportswear giant.

"We have been made aware of a potential data protection incident at one of our independent licensing partners and distributor for martial arts products," an Adidas spokesperson told The Register. "This is an independent company with its own IT systems."

Adidas declined to answer our questions about when the compromise occurred, or what information the crooks pilfered during the intrusion. The spokesperson added that there's "no indication that the adidas IT infrastructure, our own e-commerce platforms, or any of our consumer data are affected by the incident."

Allegations of an incident at Adidas emerged on February 16, when someone claiming to be the Lapsus$ Group posted on BreachForums (screenshot shared here on Daily Dark Web) that they compromised the sportswear giant’s extranet. According to the crooks, the stolen files – 815,000 rows of information – allegedly include: first and last names, email addresses, passwords, birthdays, company names, and "a lot of technical data."

This latest breach follows a similar, third-party security incident last year affecting the sportswear multinational in May 2025. As we reported at the time, Adidas notified customers that some of their data was stolen after an "unauthorized" person swiped it from a "third-party customer service provider."

Oh, great. Three notorious cybercrime gangs appear to be collaborating

Fraudster hacked hotel system, paid 1 cent for luxury rooms, Spanish cops say

Lapsus$ is a chaotic crew of teens and young people that gained notoriety during a 2021-2022 crime spree. The gang broke into and attempted to extort telecoms giant BT, Nvidia, Microsoft, Samsung, Vodafone, fintech firm Revolut, and Okta, using a mix of phone-based social engineering, SIM swapping, and even paying employees of target organizations for access to credentials and multi-factor authentication (MFA) codes.

In March 2022, UK police arrested and then released seven people, aged 16 to 21, for their alleged role in Lapsus$ activities. Police re-arrested and charged two of the teens for their involvement with the cybercrime gang later that month.

More recently, in early August 2025, the crew – or at least some of its members – joined a cybercrime collective with Scattered Spider and ShinyHunters, operating under the name Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters. Two months later, in October 2025, the extortion collab listed Adidas on its leak site, and claimed to have stolen more than 20 million sensitive records back in February 2024. ®

ShinyHunters allegedly drove off with 1.7M CarGurus records

Latest in a rash of grab-and-leak data incidents

CarGurus allegedly suffered a data breach with 1.7 million corporate records stolen, according to a notorious cybercrime crew that posted the online vehicle marketplace on its leak site on Wednesday.

"This is a final warning to reach out by 20 Feb 2026 before we leak along with several annoying (digital) problems that'll come your way," ShinyHunters wrote in its announcement, seen by The Register and shared on social media. The digital crooks claimed the compromised files included personally identifiable information and "other internal corporate data."

CarGurus did not immediately respond to The Register's inquiries. We will update this story when we hear back from the company.

According to ShinyHunters, the breach occurred on February 13, and it was part of the gang’s code stealing spree in which they used voice phishing to obtain single-sign-on codes from users of Okta, Microsoft, and Google services.

The Wednesday posts cap a string of 15 breaches claimed by ShinyHunters and Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters since the beginning of the year, including penetrating two investment advisory firms, Mercer Advisors and Beacon Pointe Advisors, listed on Sunday.

The extortionists set a Wednesday deadline for both companies to negotiate and threatened to leak 5 million records from Mercer and 100,000 from Beacon Pointe. Neither firm has posted a breach notification, and they did not respond to The Register's requests for comment.

At least one of the companies allegedly breached by ShinyHunters and posted to its leak site in February has said the compromise is from an old raid. On Monday, Canada Goose told us that it was "aware that a historical dataset relating to past customer transactions has recently been published online."

The down-filled jacket purveyor, however, declined to say how old the data is or how it was originally stolen.

Blockchain lending firm Figure Technology Solutions was also listed on ShinyHunters' leak site last week, and according to Have I Been Pwned, the criminals stole nearly 1 million customers' records.

A Figure spokesperson told us that "an employee was socially engineered, and that allowed an actor to download a limited number of files through their account."

"We acted quickly to block the activity and retained a forensic firm to investigate what files were affected," the spokesperson's statement, sent via email, continued. "We understand the importance of these matters and are communicating with partners and those impacted as appropriate."

The company also said it is adding "safeguards and training" to boost its digital defenses, and offering free credit monitoring to all affected individuals.

Other recent victims include investment platform Betterment, Match Group (with dating sites Hinge, Match.com, and OkCupid compromised during the intrusion), Panera Bread, and car buying and review sites Carvana and Edmunds.

ShinyHunters previously told The Register that it gained access to Betterment's systems by voice phishing its Okta single sign-on (SSO) codes, and Panera via a Microsoft Entra SSO code. The criminals' spokesperson said the CarMax and Edmunds breaches were from earlier, unrelated intrusions. ®

Fraudster hacked hotel system, paid 1 cent for luxury rooms, Spanish cops say

'First time we have detected a crime using this method,' cops say

Spanish police arrested a hacker who allegedly manipulated a hotel booking website, allowing him to pay one cent for luxury hotel stays. He also raided the mini-bars and didn't settle some of those tabs, police say.

"This cyberattack was specifically designed to alter the payment validation system, and this is the first time we have detected a crime using this method," Spain's National Police told media outlets.

The man, a 20-year-old Spanish national, was arrested while staying at a Madrid hotel with a four-night reservation that carried a €4,000 ($4,716) price tag – unless you hacked the payment system, as this fraudster did.

According to the cops, he stayed at this hotel several times, costing the business more than €20,000 ($23,608) in losses.

Police began investigating the suspect earlier this month after an unnamed online booking website reported suspicious activity. The transactions appeared normal, indicating the man paid the full amount – at first.

Days later, however, when the site transferred the actual amount paid to the hotel, the payment-validation scam surfaced, indicating that the crook paid just one cent for rooms costing €1,000 ($1,179) per night.

Adding insult to injury, police said that the man also consumed mini-bar bottles and sometimes left those bills unpaid, too.

While he may be facing a free stay at a mini-bar free, unluxurious facility for his alleged crimes, we have an idea for his next big vacay, post-prison: an inflatable moon hotel.

The definitely-going-to-happen hotel, slated to open in 2032, requires a deposit of either $250,000 or $1 million. No word on whether GRU Space, the hotel's operators, have received any one cent deposits – yet. ®

Deutsche Bahn back on track after DDoS yanks the brakes

National rail bookings and timetables disrupted for nearly 24 hours

If you wanted to book a train trip in Germany recently, you would have been out of luck. The country's national rail company says that its services were disrupted for hours because of a cyberattack.

Deutsche Bahn, which provides rail services across different subsidiaries, said its website, including booking and timetable systems, were knocked offline by a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack.

The effects of the attack were first felt on the afternoon of February 17 (1545 UTC), with both its travel app, DB Navigator, and website, bahn.de, experiencing issues affecting countless travelers.

Both of these services were restored as of 1300 UTC on Wednesday, although the company imposed temporary limitations on these systems.

"Our countermeasures were effective in minimizing the impact on our customers," DB said in a blog post.

Despite The Register'squestions, the company did not elaborate on who was behind the attack, whether the perpetrators made contact with DB, or whether customer data was compromised.

"Deutsche Bahn has been and continues to be subject to attacks on its IT systems," the company said in an update posted hours after the initial service restoration. "The current attack is specifically targeted at DB and has occurred in waves.

"The scale of the attack is considerable. Our defense mechanisms are working. We will not comment on speculation regarding the background of the attack. We are in close contact with the federal authorities.

"Our top priority remains the protection of customer data and the availability of our information and booking systems, which are accessed via IT interfaces on other platforms in addition to bahn.de and the DB Navigator app by hundreds of thousands of travelers in Germany."

DDoS attacks tend not to be used by sophisticated cybercriminals. State-backed crews will often opt for malware that leads to destruction or data theft – depending on the motive – or simply exploit vulnerabilities and zero-days for persistent access.

Financially motivated crooks often opt for some kind of extortion, which involves ransomware or data theft, or a combination of the two.

While DDoS attacks can be carried out by cybercriminals of all stripes, they are most often deployed by hacktivists – digital nuisance-makers – and typically only last for a few hours before traffic tails off, as was the case with Deutsche Bahn. ®

[TAM METİN - 962 kelime]
Def Con, one of the largest and longest-running hacking conferences in the world, announced on Wednesday that three people linked to Jeffrey Epstein are no longer allowed to attend.

The conference justified adding Pablos Holman, Vincenzo Iozzo, and Joichi Ito to its public list of banned individuals, citing the three as appearing in the Department of Justice’s latest release of files related to its investigation of the late investor and convicted sex offender. Def Con also cited an article in Politico based on emails that the three exchanged with Epstein.

Joan Vollero, a spokesperson for Iozzo, told TechCrunch in a statement that Def Con’s actions are “entirely performative, given that Mr. Iozzo has barely attended the conference in the past twenty years.”

“It was a rush to judgment not based on any investigation or wrongdoing by Mr. Iozzo,” the spokesperson said.

Representatives for Def Con, Holman, and Ito did not immediately respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment.

The move to ban the three comes days after TechCrunch reported that cybersecurity conferences Black Hat and Code Blue removed Iozzo from their official review board pages, amid new and emerging revelations linking the prominent hacker, among others, to Epstein.

Iozzo is a veteran of the cybersecurity industry who is currently the founder and chief executive of identity startup SlashID. He previously served as a director at CrowdStrike after the security giant acquired his cybersecurity startup IperLane in 2017. As TechCrunch previously reported, Iozzo interacted with Epstein between 2014 and 2018, including after the Miami Herald reported new allegations that Epstein had abused dozens of women and children.

Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to soliciting sex from girls and registered as a sex offender in New York and Florida. In 2019, the Department of Justice accused Epstein of trafficking, exploiting, and abusing dozens of underage girls. Epstein died in jail.

Iozzo previously told TechCrunch that his interactions with Epstein were “limited to business opportunities that never materialized, as well as discussion of the markets and emerging technologies,” and that he “never observed nor participated in any illegal activity or behavior.”

Prior to his startups, Iozzo was a research affiliate at MIT Media Lab, which was overseen by Ito at the time. The two appear in several Epstein emails together.

Joichi Ito was the director of the MIT Media Lab until 2019, when he resigned after it was reported that he was aware that Epstein was a convicted sex offender and that he and the university had extensive personal and financial relationships with Epstein.

Holman, meanwhile, is the general partner at venture capital firm Deep Future and describes himself on his website as “a hacker, inventor & technology futurist.”

Holman was in contact with Epstein since 2010, planned to stay at one of his apartments in New York City in 2013, and tried to help Epstein hide negative online news stories about himself.

According to an email, Epstein made plans to attend Def Con along with Holman in 2013, but it’s unclear if they attended. Def Con founder Jeff Moss said that as far as he knows, “Epstein never attended.”

Data breach at fintech giant Figure affects close to a million customers

The data breach that hit blockchain-based lending giant Figure affected nearly a million customers, according to a security researcher.

Last week, Figure confirmed a data breach allowed hackers to steal “a limited number of files” from its systems. The company did not provide specifics on what kind of data was stolen nor say how many customers were affected.

On Wednesday, Troy Hunt, a security researcher and creator of the data breach notification site Have I Been Pwned, analyzed the data allegedly taken from Figure and found it contained 967,200 unique email addresses associated with Figure customers.

The data also included customer names, dates of birth, physical addresses, and phone numbers.

Figure did not respond to a request for comment and did not respond to whether the company disputes Hunt’s findings.

The cybercrime group ShinyHunters told TechCrunch last week that it was to blame for the cyberattack targeting Figure. The group published 2.5 gigabytes of data allegedly stolen from Figure on its leak website, where the hackers shame their victims and publish stolen data if they fail to extort the hacked companies.

[TAM METİN - 1352 kelime]
The internet today has a permissions problem. As non-humans — chatbots, AI agents, and automated systems — have proliferated on the web, so has the need to provide them with credentials, permissions, and identities. That’s one major reason identity and access management startups that help manage this new kind of digital workforce are raking in venture capital.

Now, a 35-person Israeli-American startup called Venice is emerging from stealth with fresh cash and a plucky claim: that it’s already replacing industry stalwarts like CyberArk and Okta at Fortune 500 companies.

Venice, founded just over two years ago, says it raised $20 million in Series A funding in December, led by IVP, with participation from Index Ventures, which led its earlier seed round.

Unlike many of its well-funded rivals — which include Persona (raised a $200 million Series D last April), Veza (closed a $108 million Series D last May), and GitGuardian SAS (raised $50 million last week) — Venice is tackling both cloud-based and on-premises environments, a technical choice that has made the product harder to build but positioned it to win over the large enterprises still running legacy systems alongside modern cloud infrastructure.

At its helm sits 31-year-old Rotem Lurie, whose path to entrepreneurship pretty much ticks every box on VCs’ checklists. The daughter of two programmer parents in Israel (her mother was one of the country’s first female software engineers), Lurie spent four-and-a-half years as a lieutenant in Unit 8200, Israel’s elite intelligence corps, before joining Microsoft as a product manager working on what would become Defender for Identity.

She later became the first product hire at Axis Security, an access management startup that sold to Hewlett Packard Enterprise for $500 million in 2022. Just before that acquisition closed, Lurie left to join YL Ventures, a cybersecurity-focused venture firm.

That brief stint at YL Ventures proved particularly instructive. “Every day, I used to meet a team of three 23-year-old boys,” Lurie says straightforwardly over a Zoom call. “Most of those companies build their technology to be acquired. The entire strategy around what problem you’re solving and how you penetrate the market — it’s a completely different approach.”

To replace incumbents like CyberArk, which has long dominated the privileged access management market, Lurie realized she’d need to play a longer game. That meant building technology that’s both deep and comprehensive enough to support the complex, hybrid IT environments of most large enterprises.

The technical challenge ahead of Lurie went thus: Most identity and access management teams juggle roughly 10 different tools to manage who and what has access to corporate systems. Venice’s platform consolidates that sprawl into a single system that handles privileged access across on-premises servers, SaaS applications, and cloud infrastructure for humans and non-human entities alike.

“Tying everything together was what mattered to customers the most,” Lurie says. Indeed, Venice operates a SaaS subscription model, but Lurie insists it isn’t competing on price. “We reduce the cost, but it’s not because we go cheap on pricing,” she explains.

“It’s because we spare all the overhead [associated with many of today’s offerings], especially the professional services” — the consultant fees and lengthy implementations that have become an almost unavoidable tax for enterprise security deployments.

The bet appears to be paying off. Lurie says Venice is now “completely replacing” legacy vendors at Fortune 500 and Fortune 1000 customers, and cutting implementation time to just a week-and-a-half, from the typical six months to two years, thanks to AI-powered automation. While she declined to name customers on the record, she told TechCrunch off the record that they include a 170-year-old, publicly traded manufacturing giant as well as a global music conglomerate.

Cack Wilhelm, the partner at IVP who led Venice’s Series A, says Lurie stood out. “The problem with most cybersecurity pitches is everyone’s tackling something too small to ever be material,” Wilhelm says. “When you look at the massive exits — CrowdStrike, Palo Alto Networks — they were doing audacious things from the beginning. Rotem is the same.”

Wilhelm points to the urgency created by AI agents as a key factor driving IVP’s investment thesis. “If every individual is going to have tens of agents working on their behalf, and privileged access tools were built for a static world of IT professionals, we need our identity concept to adjust to that,” Wilhelm said. “Very often, when [companies] are breached, they’re breached by people simply logging in with someone else’s credentials. You solve that with just-in-time permissions that are scoped to the individual and the moment.”

Though crowded, the market seems eager for new solutions. Identity and access management spending was expected to exceed $24 billion in 2025, increasing by 13% from a year earlier, according to an industry group called Identity Management Institute.

Venice’s team is split between Israel, where R&D is based, and North America, where the go-to-market team operates. Notably, nearly half of the cybersecurity company is women, a rarity in one of tech’s most stubbornly male-dominated sectors.

Lurie’s co-founder, Or Vaknin, serves as CTO (he’s pictured with Lurie, above). The company’s investors include Assaf Rappaport, co-founder and CEO of Wiz, and Raaz Herzberg, CMO at Wiz and Lurie’s former colleague from their days as interns at Microsoft.

For Lurie, who says she has spent much of her career as “the only woman in the room,” creating a more balanced team wasn’t a calculated act. “You can never see yourself doing something if you didn’t see someone like you doing it,” she says. “This is something that attracts other women — to feel like they can be part of it.”

The question now is whether Venice’s two-year head start and early Fortune 500 wins will be enough to fend off deep-pocketed competitors as they chase the same enterprise buyers. Can the market support multiple winners? Or, will identity management follow the path of other security categories and consolidate around one or two dominant players?

[37] TechCrunch Security - Microsoft says Office bug exposed customers’ confidential emails to Copilot AI

Microsoft says Office bug exposed customers’ confidential emails to Copilot AI

Microsoft has confirmed that a bug allowed its Copilot AI to summarize customers’ confidential emails for weeks without permission.

The bug, first reported by Bleeping Computer, allowed Copilot Chat to read and outline the contents of emails since January, even if customers had data loss prevention policies to prevent ingesting their sensitive information into Microsoft’s large language model.

Copilot Chat allows paying Microsoft 365 customers to use the AI-powered chat feature in its Office software products, including Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.

Microsoft said the bug, trackable by admins as CW1226324, means that draft and sent email messages “with a confidential label applied are being incorrectly processed by Microsoft 365 Copilot chat.”

The tech giant said it began rolling out a fix for the bug earlier in February. A spokesperson for Microsoft did not respond to a request for comment, including a question about how many customers are affected by the bug.

Earlier this week, the European Parliament’s IT department told lawmakers that it blocked the built-in AI features on their work-issued devices, citing concerns that the AI tools could upload potentially confidential correspondence to the cloud.

[38] CSO Online - Hackers can turn Grok, Copilot into covert command-and-control channels, researchers warn

Hackers can turn Grok, Copilot into covert command-and-control channels, researchers warn

Permissive AI access and limited monitoring could allow malware to hide within trusted enterprise traffic, thereby accelerating adaptive, AI-driven attacks.

Enterprise security teams racing to enable generative AI tools may be overlooking a new risk: attackers can abuse web-based AI assistants such as Grok and Microsoft Copilot to quietly relay malware communications through domains that are often exempt from deeper inspection.

The technique, outlined by Check Point Research (CPR), exploits the web-browsing and URL-fetch capabilities of these platforms to create a bidirectional command-and-control channel that blends into routine AI traffic and requires neither an API key nor an authenticated account.

“Our proposed attack scenario is quite simple: an attacker infects a machine and installs a piece of malware,” CPR said. The malware then communicates with the AI assistant through the web interface, prompting it to fetch content from an attacker-controlled URL and return embedded instructions to the implant.

Because many organizations allow outbound access to AI services by default and apply limited inspection to that traffic, the approach effectively turns trusted AI domains into covert egress infrastructure.

Security analysts said the findings expose a growing blind spot in enterprise AI governance.

“Enterprises that allow unrestricted outbound access to public AI web services without inspection, identity controls, or strong logging are more exposed than many realize,” said Sakshi Grover, senior research manager for IDC Asia Pacific Cybersecurity Services.

“These platforms can effectively function as trusted external endpoints, meaning malicious activity can be concealed within normal network traffic, including routine HTTPS sessions to widely used AI domains,” she added.

Sunil Varkey, a cybersecurity analyst, said the technique echoes past evasion strategies such as steganography and “living off the land” attacks, where adversaries abuse legitimate tools and trusted infrastructure to avoid detection.

CPR said using AI platforms as C2 relays is only one potential abuse case. The same interfaces could be prompted to generate operational commands on demand, from locating files and enumerating systems to producing PowerShell scripts for lateral movement, allowing malware to determine its next steps without direct human control.

In a more advanced scenario, an implant could transmit a brief profile of the infected host and rely on the model to determine how the attack should progress.

A structural shift in detection

The research also points to a broader shift in how malware may evolve as AI becomes embedded in runtime operations rather than just development workflows.

“When AI moves from assisting development to actively guiding malware behavior at runtime, detection can no longer rely solely on static signatures or known infrastructure indicators,” said Krutik Poojara, a cybersecurity practitioner. “Instead of hardcoded logic, you are dealing with adaptive, polymorphic, context-aware behavior that can change without modifying the malware itself.”

Grover said this makes attacks harder to fingerprint, forcing defenders to rely more on behavioral detection and tighter correlation across endpoint, network, identity, and SaaS telemetry.

More significantly, this changes the tempo of defense. If attackers can dynamically adjust commands and execution paths based on the environment they encounter, security teams are no longer responding to a fixed playbook but to a continuously evolving interaction.

“This compresses the window between intrusion and impact and increases the importance of real-time detection, automated response, and tighter feedback loops between threat intelligence and SOC operations,” Grover said.

Security leaders should not respond by blocking AI outright, analysts said, but by applying the same governance discipline used for other high-risk SaaS platforms.

Varkey recommended starting with a comprehensive inventory of all AI tools in use and establishing a clear policy framework for approving and enabling them.

Organizations should also implement AI-specific traffic monitoring and sequence-based detection rules to identify abnormal automation patterns. Other options to consider include rolling out phased awareness programs. “From an architectural standpoint, organizations should also invest in platforms that provide unified visibility across network, cloud, identity, and application layers, enabling security teams to correlate signals and trace activity across domains rather than treating AI usage as isolated web traffic,” Grover said.

Cybersicherheit braucht Reife und keine Checklisten

CISOs wissen: Der Reifegrad ihres Programms ist für die Wirksamkeit der Cybersicherheitsmaßnahmen entscheidend. Dies erfordert eine entsprechende Führung.

Overearth – shutterstock.com

Cybersicherheit wird oft wie ein Spiel behandelt. Unternehmen jagen schnellen Erfolgen hinterher, haken Compliance-Listen ab oder klopfen sich nach einem einzigen erfolgreichen Audit selbst auf die Schulter. Auf dem Papier mag das produktiv aussehen, aber in Wirklichkeit schafft es ein falsches Gefühl der Sicherheit. Der CISO stellt in diesem Bild den Quarterback dar, auf dem die ganze Verantwortung lastet.

Cybersecurity ist jedoch kein Spiel. Sie erfordert eine ausgereifte Führung, langfristiges Denken und klare Verantwortlichkeiten. Alles andere setzt Unternehmen unnötigen Risiken aus. CISOs wissen um diesen Umstand, müssen ihn aber immer wieder in ihren Organisationen zur Sprache bringen.

Zu viele Sicherheitsteams verlassen sich auf Aktivitäten, die wie Fortschritte aussehen und dargestellt werden, aber das Risiko nicht wesentlich verringern. Dinge wie gelegentliche simulierte Phishing-Tests, auffällige neue Sicherheitstools oder die Erfüllung grundlegender Compliance-Anforderungen können ein beruhigendes Gefühl vermitteln. Das Problem ist, dass diese Aktivitäten oft nur die Symptome bekämpfen, nicht aber die Ursachen.

Häufige Beispiele hierfür sind:

Compliance als Errungenschaft statt als Ausgangspunkt betrachten.

Vorfälle als isolierte Ereignisse statt als Indikatoren für systemische Probleme behandeln.

Kennzahlen verfolgen, die gut aussehen, aber nicht die tatsächliche Widerstandsfähigkeit messen.

Glauben, dass Technologie Lücken schließen kann, die durch schwache Governance oder unklare Prozesse entstanden sind.

Das alles ist nur Scheinsicherheit. Es schafft Sichtbarkeit, aber keinen echten Schutz. CISOs sollten Risiken als real und gegenwärtig behandeln. Sie müssen Sicherheitsprogramme entwickeln, die wechselnden Bedrohungen, Personalfluktuation und unerfahrenen Teams standhalten können. Starke Führung ist nicht reaktiv. Sie ist stattdessen bewusst und informiert.

Erfolgreiche CISOs konzentrieren sich auf:

Menschen und Prozesse und priorisieren diese vor technischen Hilfsmitteln

Kulturelle Erwartungen und Verantwortlichkeiten

Klare Zuständigkeiten

Entscheidungsfindung auf der Grundlage von Cyberrisiken und ihren Datenanalysen

Langfristige Resilienz anstatt kurzfristiger Erfolg

Das ist der Unterschied zwischen einem Sicherheitsprogramm, das wirklich funktioniert, und einem, das nur Checklisten abhakt.

Der Wandel vom Spiel zum echten Programm

Der Übergang von einem reaktiven Ansatz zu einem ausgereiften Sicherheitsprogramm beginnt mit einer Änderung der Denkweise. CISOs müssen sich dafür entscheiden, aus dem „Spielmodus“ auszusteigen. Das Ziel besteht bislang darin, mögliche Probleme für ein weiteres Quartal zu vermeiden. Stattdessen müssen sie sich dazu verpflichten, Programme zu entwickeln, die echten Bedrohungen standhalten können.

Zu den wichtigsten Grundsätzen eines solchen Programmes gehören:

Compliance ist die Mindestanforderung, nicht das Endziel.

Sicherheitsmetriken sollten reale Ergebnisse messen, wie die Zeit bis zur Erkennung und Reaktion.

Jeder Vorfall sollte Erkenntnisse liefern, die das Programm verbessern.

Die Planung der Ausfallsicherheit sollte genauso wichtig sein wie die Prävention.

Die Verantwortlichkeit sollte geteilt, sichtbar und messbar sein.

Dies sind die Grundlagen eines ausgereiften Sicherheitsprogramms. Denn die Notwendigkeit wird jeden Tag sichtbar, die Bedrohungslandschaft entwickelt sich mit einer Geschwindigkeit weiter, die jeden Checklistenansatz übertrifft. Hochprofessionelle Angreifer gehen zielgerichtet vor. Sie arbeiten zusammen, automatisieren und innovieren. Sie spielen kein Spiel, verlassen sich nicht auf Checklisten.

Wenn Unternehmen Sicherheit weiterhin als eine Reihe von Aufgaben und nicht als strategische Disziplin behandeln, werden sie ins Hintertreffen geraten. Sicherheitsvorfälle sind keine Zufälle. Sie sind das vorhersehbare Ergebnis einer unreifen Führung.

CISOs müssen daher die Ernsthaftigkeit vorleben, die diese Aufgabe erfordert. Sicherheit ist kein Spiel. Es gibt keine Auszeiten und keine einfachen Neustarts. Was Unternehmen heute aufbauen, wird darüber entscheiden, ob sie den Bedrohungen von morgen standhalten können. Eine Führung mit entsprechender Reife macht den Unterschied zwischen scheinbarer Sicherheit und tatsächlicher Sicherheit aus. (jm)

[40] CSO Online - From in-house CISO to consultant. What you need to know before making the leap

From in-house CISO to consultant. What you need to know before making the leap

The move from in-house CISO to consultant promises autonomy and impact, but it also forces security leaders to rethink both their skill set and their mindset.

What ultimately crystallized the decision was the thought that his impact didn’t have to stop at the edge of one organization. “I was solving the same problems repeatedly in one company,” he says, “when I could solve them for multiple companies simultaneously, multiplying my impact and helping more businesses grow through pragmatic security leadership.”

In August 2025, Kokhreidze launched his consulting business, Mandos. But he’s careful not to romanticize the move. “It’s important to stay realistic,” he says. Going solo takes time and patience. It means figuring out where you can be most useful. And being willing to stay flexible. “You have to be ready to pivot when you have new ideas, or when things don’t work out,” he says.

Like Kokhreidze, a growing number of CISOs are either moving into consulting roles or seriously considering it. The appeal is easy to see: more flexibility and quicker learning, alongside steady demand for experienced security leaders.

Some of these professionals work as virtual CISOs (vCISOs), advising companies from a distance. Others operate as fractional CISOs, embedding into the organization one or two days a week.

“Consulting gives me more autonomy and control over how I work, while still letting me apply the same strategic approach to improving resilience, governance, and practical security execution,” says Antanas Kedys, founder and CEO at ACyber. He made the shift from an in-house CISO role to consulting in 2022, because he wanted to grow and work across different environments.

When a CISO transitions into consulting, their role changes in ways that aren’t always obvious at first. The new job means sharpening some skills, building entirely new ones and, perhaps hardest of all, learning to let go of control.

“As a CISO, you can mandate; as a consultant, you can only influence,” says Nigel Gibbons, director and senior advisor at NCC Group.

How to prepare to make the leap from security leader to consultant

Long before stepping away from a full-time role, Kokhreidze and other security leaders tried to quietly plan ahead. They tested ideas, built visibility, reconnected with old contacts, and began mapping out who their potential clients might be. The list of potential should be a long one, because few conversations tend to turn into actual work.

“If someone is not asking you right now to consult for them, it can take 12-18 months before you land your first client,” says Carlota Sage. She held a part-time CISO role at a nonprofit before transitioning into vCISO work. Later, she went on to found Pocket CISO, which provides cybersecurity services to early-stage startups and small organizations.

Kokhreidze agrees with her. For a smoother transition, he suggests CISOs line up their first clients while they’re still employed. Otherwise, he says, it can take a long time to build momentum. And the pressure to make it work can quickly turn into panic. In that moment, security professionals may start “underpricing themselves because they need money immediately,” he says. Once rates are set out of desperation, they’re often hard to reset without straining the relationship.

Other CISOs-turned-consultants also emphasize preparation. Kedys, for instance, stresses the need for a go-to-market focus. “Decide who you want to advise (industry, company size, maturity), what problems you’ll solve, and why you’re credible for that,” he says. “The combination of strong soft skills and a clear focus — who, how, and why — is the best starting point for a successful transition.”

Gibbons adds that consulting should grow out of a CISO’s existing experience. He suggests treating that experience as a set of real-world case studies worth talking about, capturing the decisions, the trade-offs, what went wrong and what worked. He also stresses the importance of building relationships beyond the security function, including legal teams, auditors, regulators and investors. “Consulting is ultimately a trust-based profession not a technical one,” he adds.

Skills that carry over into consulting

Many of the skills CISOs honed inside large organizations translate directly to the new consulting job, while others suddenly matter more than they ever did before. In addition to technical skills, it is often the practical ones that prove most valuable.

The ability to prioritize — sharpened over years in a CISO role — becomes especially important in consulting. “It matters more than anything else,” Gibbons argues, because in consulting environments resources are often limited. Consultants are paid not to know everything, but to know what matters most, which risks to tackle first, and which problems can safely wait.

Crisis management is another essential skill. Paired with hands-on knowledge of cybersecurity processes and best practices, it gives former CISOs a real advantage as they move into consulting. Kedys highlights stress management: the ability to stay calm, focused and keep execution moving under pressure, which is just as valuable outside the enterprise as it ever was inside.

But if there’s one translatable skill that everyone talks about, that skill is communication. “All of your security and compliance knowledge is wasted if you cannot communicate to a business audience,” Sage says.

Kokhreidze agrees. Instead of leading with controls, tools or technical details, he focuses on what CTOs and other business leaders actually care about: outcomes. He talks about how security protects revenue, supports resilience, or builds confidence with regulators.

New skills needed in the toolkit

As CISOs move into consulting, they quickly discover they need new skills as well, some of which they may have deliberately avoided in their in-house roles. Chief among them is sales. “Eighty percent of your work is actually selling yourself,” says Kokhreidze. “You are first a business, and CISO second.”

And being a business is time-consuming. Consultants must juggle personal branding, marketing, accounting, and writing. Writing and online presence, in particular, matter because done well, they signal credibility and give current and future clients a sense of how a CISO thinks.

The multiple roles consultants have to play — switching between delivery, sales, marketing and admin while juggling several clients — come with a real mental toll. For many former in-house executives, adjusting to that constant context switching is one of the hardest parts of leaving a structured organization behind. “If you’re running your own consulting firm, context switching can be a struggle,” Sage says.

In time, many consultants learn that discipline matters, and that saying no is part of the job. “You must become comfortable saying no to work that dilutes your positioning or turns you back into an outsourced operator rather than a trusted advisor,” Gibbons says.

Setting the right price

Many CISOs know their value inside an enterprise but translating that value into a consulting price is a different challenge altogether. It requires a shift from thinking like an employee to thinking like a business.

“Skills are not different from a product,” Kedys says. “You just need to find the right product (in this case, the skill) and wrap it in a way a market will be most likely to take it.”

That understanding, he adds, comes from market analysis: observing how executives buy, what they value, and what comparable services cost.

Sage agrees with the idea of analyzing the market but says that CISOs coming from large enterprises and targeting small and mid-sized organizations often need to recalibrate their expectations. What feels like a modest rate to a global organization can be misaligned with the realities of smaller clients, particularly those buying advisory services for the first time.

When thinking about pricing, Kokhreidze took a two-way approach. He looked at the market and assessed his value. Then he set a realistic income goal and worked backwards, factoring in how many clients he could serve well. The result was a pricing model that favored quality over volume, a trade-off he knew the clients he wanted to work with would resonate with.

“B2B companies closing enterprise deals understand that professional security leadership costs far less than losing a single €10M+ contract to failed security reviews,” Kokhreidze says.

When setting prices, one of the most common mistakes is charging for time rather than for the value the consultant brings to the table. Early in his career, Gibbons priced his work by the day instead of by the consequences it helped clients avoid. Over time, he moved toward outcome-based engagements, such as board assurance, regulatory readiness and post-incident recovery, so clients can understand more easily what they’re paying for.

“Clients are buying judgment, not hours,” Gibbons says.

This approach, however, is not universal. Some more traditional organizations remain firmly attached to day rates. In those environments, shifting negotiations can be difficult regardless of the expertise being offered.

Potential mistakes to avoid

Ask experienced consultants what mistakes newcomers tend to make, and the answers tend to be consistent. The biggest mistakes are rarely about security skills. They tend to cluster around mindset, money, and figuring out how to show up in the market.

“The hardest lesson was realizing that being a great CISO doesn’t guarantee clients at all,” Kokhreidze says. “I quickly learned that professional expertise means nothing without strong sales and qualification skills, because you’ll waste months chasing companies that either don’t have the problem you’re trying to solve or aren’t ready to invest in fixing it.”

Gibbons sees a related issue: consultants trying to recreate an in-house role from the outside. They take on operational responsibility, running programs or becoming embedded indefinitely. “That erodes margins and credibility,” he says.

Another common misstep he points to is leading with tools, frameworks or certifications rather than judgment and experience. “Clients do not hire former CISOs for policy templates,” he argues. “They hire them to help make hard decisions with incomplete information.”

Even CISOs who plan carefully before making the leap often discover that the freedom of consulting comes with hidden costs. As Sage puts it, “Most CISOs consulting for the first time underestimate how much time and effort go into just managing your own business.”

Notepad++ author says fixes make update mechanism ‘effectively unexploitable’

Hardening had to be done after a threat actor compromised updates with a custom backdoor.

The recently compromised update mechanism for the popular open source text editor Notepad ++ has been hardened so it’s now ‘effectively unexploitable’, says the application’s author.

Don Ho made the claim this week after the release of version 8.9.2 of Notepad++, which includes a double-lock verification that any download of the tool from this point on is genuine. The latest version verifies the signed XML returned by the update server in addition to the first step of the hardening in version 8.8.9, released in December, which verifies the authenticity of the signed installer downloaded from GitHub.

The application auto-updater has also been reinforced.

These actions aren’t foolproof, Ho admits in his blog, because it’s possible to exclude the auto-updater during the UI installation, or to deploy the installer with a specific command specifying the updater not be used.

In an email today to CSOonline, Ho said that no system can ever be declared absolutely unbreakable, “but the new design dramatically raises the bar.”

An attacker must now compromise both the hosting infrastructure and the signing keys, he explained, adding that the updater now validates both the manifest and the installer, each with independent cryptographic signatures. And any mismatch, missing signature, or certificate anomaly causes the update to abort automatically.

“This layered verification makes the update chain resilient even in the face of future infrastructure‑level compromises,” he concluded.

Another supply chain attack

One reason the compromise went undetected for so long is that only a small number of downloaders — far less than 0.1%  — were specifically targeted by the attackers, Ho said, and the attackers were very cautious. “Their goal was long‑term espionage,” he noted, “so they acted quietly and deliberately to remain undetected for as long as possible.”

Compromising the update mechanism of an application is a classic way for a threat actor to infiltrate dozens, hundreds, or thousands of organizations that unwitting then use the hacked version of the software. One of the most notorious examples was the 2019/2020 compromise of the update infrastructure of Solarwinds’ Orion network monitoring suite. Another was the 2017 NotPetya attack that spread around the world after a Ukrainian tax application was hacked.

The Notepad++ problem began with the discovery that the IT infrastructure hosting Notepad++ had been compromised in June 2025, and a custom backdoor had been installed in the application. In the highly-targeted attack, traffic from certain users was selectively redirected to attacker-controlled servers by the malicious updates. Researchers at Rapid7 believe a China-based group dubbed Lotus Blossom was behind the attack.

The now former hosting provider believes the shared hosting server was compromised from June to September of 2025. However, even after losing server access, the attackers maintained credentials to internal services until December 2, 2025, allowing the continued redirection of Notepad++ update traffic. With the release of Notepad++ version 8.8.9, and the security hardening, all attacker access was terminated. Version 8.9.1 had even more security enhancements, and this week’s version 8.9.2 instituted the double-lock process.

“Developers must plan for adversaries who are patient, sophisticated, and selective,” Ho said. Infrastructure is part of your attack surface, he pointed out; even if your code is secure, a weak link in hosting, DNS, or a content delivery network (CDN) can undermine everything. “Continuous monitoring and strict credential hygiene are essential,” he said, and application developers must assume that partial compromise is possible and design applications and their delivery and update mechanisms for failure.

And if there is a compromise, he added, rapid disclosure, detailed technical explanations, and prompt fixes help users understand the scope and maintain confidence in the project.

Jeff Pollard, who leads Forrester Research’s work on the role of the CSO, said the fixes “significantly reduce” the risk of this specific failure mode recurring. But, he added, no single change ‘solves’ all supply chain risks. Attackers can shift to other choke points such as build pipelines or signing keys, he pointed out. “The key takeaway is that Notepad++ closed the exploited gap and raised the attacker cost,” he said.

Small utilities like Notepad++ usually sit outside of procurement, inventory, and third party risk management controls, he said, which is why they are ubiquitous among technical users, and valuable targets for adversaries.

“Asset management and software inventory is a perpetual problem for enterprises, but this event demonstrates why it’s so important to understand all the software in your environment, no matter how big or small it is,” he said.

Douglas McKee, Rapid7’s senior director of vulnerability intelligence, said the Notepad++ supply chain incident underscores a broader evolution in how threat actors think about software trust and persistence. While updates to the Notepad++ distribution mechanism and the release of version 8.9.2 with enhanced double-lock update security help close the specific vulnerability exploited in this campaign, they do not on their own solve the systemic problem of modern supply chain risk.

“What this incident makes clear, and what organizations must internalize, is that supply chain security cannot be limited to source code and build systems,” he said. “Attackers targeted hosting infrastructure and update delivery flows outside of the project’s direct control. Only by reinforcing signature and certificate validation, and treating update infrastructure as part of the attack surface, can defenders meaningfully reduce exposure.”

[42] CSO Online - Chinese hackers exploited zero-day Dell RecoverPoint flaw for 1.5 years

Chinese hackers exploited zero-day Dell RecoverPoint flaw for 1.5 years

A suspected Chinese espionage group exploited hardcoded admin credentials in Dell RecoverPoint for Virtual Machines to deploy web shells and maintain persistence in enterprise VMware environments.

For the past 18 months, a Chinese cyberespionage group has been exploiting a prevously unknown vulnerability in Dell’s RecoverPoint for Virtual Machines, a VM disaster recovery solution. The flaw, patched by Dell this week, allows unauthenticated attackers to gain command execution on the underlying OS as root.

The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2026-22769, stems from hardcoded admin credentials for the Apache Tomcat Manager, which can be leveraged to deploy malicious WAR (Web Application Archive) files. Apache Tomcat is a web server for Java-based web applications.

Researchers from Google’s Mandiant team discovered the critical vulnerability while investigating multiple compromised Dell RecoverPoint for Virtual Machines instances in a customer environment sending out command-and-control (C2) traffic associated with two backdoos known as BRICKSTORM and GRIMBOLT. These backdoors are used by a China-linked APT group that Mandiant tracks as UNC6201, which is known to target VMware-related enterprise infrastructure.

Dell RecoverPoint for Virtual Machines is a data replication and protection appliance for VMware environments, which makes it an attractive target for this group. The new vulnerability affects versions 5.3 SP4 P1, 6.0, 6.0 SP1, 6.0 SP1 P1, 6.0 SP1 P2, 6.0 SP2, 6.0 SP2 P1, 6.0 SP3, and 6.0 SP3 P1. Customers are strongly encouraged to upgrade to the patched 6.0.3.1 HF1 version, but if that’s not immediately possible Dell also released a remediation script.

Attackers upgrade from BRICKSTORM to GRIMBOLT

UNC6201’s activities overlap significantly with another group that Mandiant and Google’s Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) track as UNC5221, which is known for targeting network-edge appliances using zero-day exploits. Other security companies attribute this activity to the Chinese state-sponsored hacker group Silk Typhoon or APT27, but Google believes this to be a different threat actor.

UNC5221 has compromised the networks of US legal services firms, SaaS providers, business process outsourcers, and technology companies over the past few years and deployed Linux backdoor BRICKSTORM and a web shell called SLAYSTYLE that has been installed on compromised vCenter deployments.

Both BRICKSTORM and SLAYSTYLE have also been observed in the new Dell RecoverPoint compromises attributed to UNC6201. However, the threat actor also deployed a new backdoor called GRIMBOLT.

“GRIMBOLT is a C#-written foothold backdoor compiled using native ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation and packed with UPX,” Mandiant’s researchers said. “It provides a remote shell capability and uses the same command and control as previously deployed BRICKSTORM payload.”

There is evidence that UNC6201 has been exploiting CVE-2026-22769 since mid-2024 to deploy the SLAYSTYLE web shell. However, the replacement of BRICKSTORM with GRIMBOLT did not happen until September 2025. It’s not clear if this was the result of planned iteration or as a reaction to BRICKSTORM being exposed by Mandiant and other security companies at around that time.

In addition to the payloads themselves, the investigation also revealed new techniques. For example, the legitimate shell script convert_hosts.sh that exists on these appliances has been modified to include the path of the backdoors to achieve persistence.

The SLAYSTYLE web shell, which is designed to receive commands over HTTP and execute them on the system, was used to set up proxy rules via the Linux iptables utility. Namely, incoming traffic on port 443 (HTTPS) that contained a particular HEX string was silently redirected to port 10443 for the next 5 minutes.

Another novel technique was the creation of temporary network ports on existing virtual machines on VMware ESXi servers to access other services inside the environments.

Charles Carmakal, CTO at Mandiant, described the technique on LinkedIn as deploying “ghost NICs on virtual machines to evade defenders” because it left investigators chasing network activity from IP addresses that no longer existed and were never documented.

Network-edge appliances have become a common entry point into enterprise networks for sophisticated attackers. These appliances are not typically covered by logging solutions, lack endpoint malware detection, yet contain troves of credentials and provide great pivot points to internal services.

Dell recommends RecoverPoint for VMs be deployed inside a trusted, access-controlled network behind appropriate firewalls and segmentation, not on public-facing infrastructure. Meanwhile, the Mandiant blog post includes indicators of compromise and YARA detection rules for the new GRIMBOLT and SLAYSTYLE payloads.

Millionen Chrome-Erweiterungen geben Browserverlauf preis

Schätzungsweise 37 Millionen weltweit installierte Chrome-Erweiterungen übertragen den Browserverlauf der Nutzer an externe Server.

2lttgamingroom – shutterstock.com

Ein Sicherheitsforscher mit dem Pseudonym „Q Continuum“ hat 287 Chrome-Erweiterungen entdeckt, die den Browserverlauf exfiltrieren. „Die Akteure hinter den Lecks sind vielfältig: Similarweb, Curly Doggo, Offidocs, chinesische Akteure, viele kleinere, unbekannte Datenbroker sowie ein mysteriöses Unternehmen namens ‚Big Star Labs‘, das offenbar ein Ableger von Similarweb ist“, heißt es im Forschungsbericht.

Für die Analyse entwickelte der Forscher eine automatisierte Pipeline, die Chrome-Instanzen startete, Erweiterungen installierte, eine vordefinierte Reihe von Websites besuchte und ausgehende Kommunikationen erfasste.

VPNs, Produktivitäts-Tools und Shopping-Add-ons

Die Untersuchung identifizierte zahlreiche weit verbreitete Erweiterungen mit riskantem Verhalten in Kategorien wie VPN-/Proxy-Dienste, Coupon-Finder, PDF-Tools und Browser-Dienstprogramme. Viele davon haben Hunderttausende oder Millionen von Nutzern.

Bei einigen dieser Erweiterungen handelt es sich um Pop-up-Blocker für Chrome. Darunter Stylish, BlockSite block Websites, Stay Focused und SimilarWeb. Website Traffic und SEO Checker, WOT: Website Security und Safety Checker, Smarty, Video Ad Blocker Plus für YouTube, Knowee AI und CrxMouse: Mouse Gestures.

Dem Forscher zufolge forderten mehrere der Erweiterungen umfassende Host-Berechtigungen (webseitenübergreifend) an. Dadurch konnten sie Navigationsereignisse und Seitenaktivitäten domänenübergreifend beobachten. „Wenn eine Erweiterung nur den Seitentitel liest oder CSS einfügt, sollte ihr Netzwerk-Fußabdruck unabhängig von der Länge der von uns besuchten URL gleich bleiben“, erklärt er die Logik hinter ihrer Kennzeichnung in seinem Beitrag.

„Wenn der ausgehende Datenverkehr linear mit der URL-Länge wächst, ist die Wahrscheinlichkeit hoch, dass die Erweiterung die URL selbst (oder die gesamte HTTP-Anfrage) an einen Remote-Server sendet“, ergänzt der Experte.

Verschlüsselte Exfiltration erschwerte die Erkennung

Zudem weist er darauf hin, dass mehrere dieser Erweiterungen versuchten, die Art der übertragenen Daten zu verbergen. Demnach wurden ausgehende Nutzdaten häufig vor der Übertragung verschlüsselt oder codiert, was eine automatisierte Überprüfung verhinderte.

„Die manuelle Überprüfung des erfassten Datenverkehrs ergab eine Vielzahl von Verschleierungstechniken: Base64, ROT47, LZ-String-Komprimierung und vollständige AES-256-Verschlüsselung, verpackt in RSA-OAEP“, erläutert der Forscher in einem weiteren Bericht. „Die Entschlüsselung dieser Nutzdaten ergab, dass rohe Google-Such-URLs, Seitenverweise, Benutzer-IDs und Zeitstempel an ein Netzwerk aus proprietären Domains und Endpunkten von Cloud-Anbietern gesendet wurden.

Die Testumgebung des Forschers führte Chrome in einem Docker-Container aus, sodass jede Erweiterung isoliert und konsistent analysiert werden konnte.

Der Security-Spezialist räumte allerdings ein, dass wahrscheinlich nicht alle Erweiterungen, die den Browserverlauf preisgeben, böswillige Absichten haben. Er stellte zudem klar, dass einige Fehlalarme manuell aus den Protokollen der von den automatisierten Scannern markierten Erweiterungen entfernt werden mussten. „Einige der Erweiterungen sind möglicherweise harmlos und müssen den Browserverlauf für Funktionen wie beispielsweise ‚Avast Online Security & Privacy‘ erfassen.“

Der Bericht zur Offenlegung enthielt eine Liste mit URLs aus dem Chrome Web Store und den Akteuren hinter diesen Erweiterungen als Referenz. (jm)

[44] CSO Online - Flaws in four popular VS Code extensions left 128 million installs open to attack

Flaws in four popular VS Code extensions left 128 million installs open to attack

Three of the four vulnerabilities remained unpatched months after OX Security reported them to the maintainers.

Critical and high-severity vulnerabilities were found in four widely used Visual Studio Code extensions with a combined 128 million downloads, exposing developers to file theft, remote code execution, and local network reconnaissance.

Application security company OX Security published the findings this week, saying it had begun notifying vendors in June 2025 but received no response from three of the four maintainers.

Three CVEs, CVE-2025-65717, CVE-2025-65715, and CVE-2025-65716, were formally assigned and published on February 16.

VS Code extensions are add-ons that expand the functionality of Microsoft’s widely used code editor, adding capabilities such as language support, debugging tools, live preview, and code execution. They run with broad access to local files, terminals, and network resources, which is what made these vulnerabilities consequential.

Unlike the rogue extensions that threat actors have repeatedly planted in the VS Code marketplace, these flaws resided in legitimate, widely installed tools, meaning developers had no reason to suspect them, OX Security said in an advisory.

“Our research demonstrates that a hacker needs only one malicious extension, or a single vulnerability within one extension, to perform lateral movement and compromise entire organizations,” the advisory added.

The vulnerabilities also affected Cursor and Windsurf, the AI-powered IDEs built on VS Code’s extension infrastructure.

OX Security published individual advisories for each flaw, detailing how each could be exploited and what an attacker could achieve.

How the attacks worked

The most severe flaw, CVE-2025-65717 (critical), was in Live Server, a 72-million-download extension that launches a local HTTP server for real-time browser previews. OX Security found the server was reachable from any web page a developer visited while it was running, not just their own browser.

“Attackers only need to send a malicious link to the victim while Live Server is running in the background,” OX Security researchers Moshe Siman Tov Bustan and Nir Zadok wrote in an advisory.

CVE-2025-65715 (high severity) affected Code Runner, with 37 million downloads. The extension reads execution commands from a global configuration file, and OX Security found a crafted entry that was enough to trigger arbitrary code execution, including reverse shells. An attacker could place it by phishing a developer into pasting a malicious snippet, or through a compromised extension that modified the file silently.

CVE-2025-65716 (CVSS 8.8) affected Markdown Preview Enhanced, with 8.5 million downloads. Simply opening an untrusted Markdown file was enough to trigger it. “A malicious Markdown file could trigger scripts or embedded content that collects information about open ports on the victim’s machine,” the researchers noted.

Microsoft quietly patched its own extension

The fourth vulnerability played out differently. Microsoft’s Live Preview extension, with 11 million downloads, contained a cross-site scripting flaw that, according to OX Security, let a malicious web page enumerate files in the root of a developer’s machine and exfiltrate credentials, access keys, and other secrets.

The researchers reported the issue to Microsoft on August 7. Microsoft initially rated it as low severity, citing required user interaction.

“However, on September 11, 2025 — without notifying us — Microsoft quietly released a patch addressing the XSS security issues we reported. We only recently discovered that this patch had been deployed,” the researchers added.

No CVE was assigned to this vulnerability. “Users with Live Preview installed should update to version 0.4.16 or later immediately,” the researchers suggested.

Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Taken together, the four flaws pointed to a broader problem with how developer tools are secured and maintained.

What security teams should do

“These vulnerabilities confirm that IDEs are the weakest link in an organization’s supply chain security,” the researchers at OX Security said in the advisory.

Developer workstations routinely hold API keys, cloud credentials, database connection strings, and SSH keys. OX Security warned that a successful exfiltration from a single machine could give an attacker access to an organization’s broader infrastructure and that the risks extended to lateral movement and full system takeover.

The researchers advised developers to disable extensions not actively in use and avoid browsing untrusted sites while localhost servers are running. They also cautioned against applying configuration snippets from unverified sources to VS Code’s global settings.

Keenadu: Android malware that comes preinstalled and can’t be removed by users

Keenadu infiltrated devices by posing as legitimate system components, prompting calls for tighter controls on firmware integrity across manufacturing and supply‑chain pipelines.

There’s too little a user can do when hit with a complex Android malware that comes preinstalled on their new smartphone or tablet.

Security researchers at Kaspersky have flagged a multifaceted Android malware dubbed Keenadu that can ship preinstalled via device firmware, compromising users before they even complete setup.

“Keenadu serves as a reminder that mobile malware isn’t just a bad app problem anymore, but rather a supply chain and firmware integrity problem,” said Nick Tausek, lead security automation architect at Swimlane. “The most dangerous Keenadu variant is embedded at the firmware level, giving attackers effectively unlimited control and the ability to operate inside the context of every app on the device, which can turn a single compromised tablet or phone into an enterprise-wide data exposure risk.”

The researchers stated that the threat has already affected users across multiple countries, infecting over 13,000 devices as of February, as detected by Kaspersky. “The highest numbers of the attacked users have been observed in Russia, Japan, Germany, Brazil, and the Netherlands, but other countries have been affected as well,” Kaspersky researchers added in a blog post.

Preinstalled malware runs with elevated privileges

Kaspersky reported that Keenadu can arrive on new devices, already embedded in system software, allowing it to run with high privileges from the moment the device is activated. Because the malicious components are present in firmware rather than installed later as apps, affected users may have limited ability to detect or remove them through conventional means.

“Without any actions on the user side, a device can be infected right out of the box,” Kaspersky security researcher Dmitry Kalinin said through a statement in the blog post. “Vendors likely didn’t know about the supply chain compromise that resulted in Keenadu infiltrating devices, as the malware was imitating legitimate system components. It is important to check every stage of the production process to ensure that device firmware is not infected.”

Once active, Keenadu inherits trusted system-level permissions and operates with minimal visibility. The malware activates only under specific conditions, remaining dormant on devices set to Chinese languages or time zones and on those lacking Google Play Store and Google Play Services.

Embedded in core system apps

Keenadu can control legitimate system applications on affected devices. Kaspersky observed it inside critical components such as face unlock applications, raising the possibility that attackers could access biometric data. The malware was also found operating within the home screen app that controls the device’s primary interface.

The researchers warned that the backdoor provides attackers with extensive control over the device. Keenadu can infect other installed apps, install additional software from APK files, and grant those apps any permission available on the system. This enables compromise of sensitive data stored on the device, including media files, messages, banking credentials, and location information.

The malware can also monitor search queries in the Chrome browser, even when users operate in incognito mode.

Other ways of infection

Kaspersky noted that Keenadu’s distribution is not limited to preinstalled system components.

In some cases, the malware has also been observed embedded within applications distributed through Android app stores, where it can be delivered as a seemingly harmless download and activated after installation. Most of these apps are for smart home cameras, and they’ve been downloaded over 300,000 times, the researchers said, adding that all of those were removed as of the time of the disclosure.

Tausek says mitigation has to start earlier than “detect and remove.” “The way forward is to pair hard baselines like OTA governance and EMM policies with AI-driven prevention and containment that spots the behavioral fingerprints of backdoors before they turn into lateral movement,” he said. “AI models can continuously correlate mobile telemetry with identity, endpoint, and network signals to flag high-risk devices in real time and trigger automated guardrails like device isolation or the revocation of sessions and tokens.”

Kaspersky’s recommendations included checking for firmware updates if the device is infected, running a device scan with a “reliable” security solution, and stopping the use of or disabling the application if an infection is suspected.

[46] Infoblox Blog - Protective DNS: Harnessing DNS as a Core Weapon in MSSP Cyber Defense and Incident Response
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Wed, 18 Feb 2026 17:51:56 +0000

[TAM METİN - 862 kelime]
For security operations center (SOC) teams and managed security service providers (MSSPs), the real challenge isn’t just responding to incidents but intercepting threats before they escalate. Attacks typically begin quietly, making early detection critical.

At MSSP Alert Live, Chris Usserman, Global Public Sector chief technology officer at Infoblox, urged a shift: make Protective DNS central to cyber defense. His point was clear—prevention, not addition of more reactive tools, stops attacks before incident cleanup begins.

DNS, when fortified with predictive threat intelligence, enables MSSPs to intercept threats earlier and at scale, making it essential for preemptive protection.

What Protective DNS Does

Protective DNS applies a security policy during the DNS resolution process. When a device asks, “Where is this domain?” the DNS layer becomes a decision point. If the destination looks risky, the lookup is blocked—the device never connects.

Traditional DNS resolves any domain (malicious or legitimate) with equal efficiency. It doesn’t ask “Should I honor this request even though the destination is known to be bad?” Protective DNS acts as a guardrail, creating DNS telemetry you can log, triage and investigate. Combined with predictive threat intelligence, you’re not just blocking known threats, you’re acting on active attacks earlier with better context.

Why DNS Offers High-Leverage Control

Chris challenged the “more tools equal more security” assumption. Despite massive investments in endpoint detection and response (EDR), extended detection and response (XDR) and firewalls, attackers still breach defenses. These controls matter, but they often act too late, after attackers have gained momentum.

DNS gives you an early intervention point. Most attacks require outbound communication, such as loading phishing pages, downloading payloads or connecting to control-and-command (C2) servers. Block that destination at the DNS layer, and you stop the chain before it builds. Fewer successful connections mean fewer alerts and simpler investigations.

DNS as the First Major Obstacle

Chris described a familiar phishing scenario: a PDF invoice arrives, triggers scripting and bypasses multiple defenses. Eventually, the malware must communicate, typically via a C2 channel, for instructions or additional tools.

DNS becomes decisive here. If the compromised host can’t resolve the required domain, the connection fails. That’s what “block at the DNS layer” means: removing the attacker’s ability to reach their destination.

Chris also noted that some malware actively hunts for security tools and disables them while maintaining “healthy” appearances. Endpoint-only controls become vulnerable. Protective DNS operates outside the endpoint, so attackers must still use it to access the internet.

DNS Telemetry for Faster Incident Response

When incidents occur, responders need fast answers: Which systems contacted the attacker’s infrastructure? When? What else did the host do?

After major campaigns are uncovered, organizations routinely review DNS logs to determine if they have connected to newly identified infrastructure. DNS telemetry provides early indicators of compromise (IoCs): what was requested, when, how often and what followed. This enables rapid triage and scoping. You instantly see if other hosts made similar requests.

Chris emphasized threat attribution, which involves tying DNS events to specific assets and their owners. This makes containment a decisive rather than a guesswork approach.

Beyond Domain Reputation

Chris was direct about the limitations of reputation feeds. Most require “patient zero”—someone gets compromised before the domain is flagged. That’s inherently reactive.

New domains appear constantly. Threat actors register and quickly abandon their infrastructure. Adding lookalike domains and pure blocklist approaches becomes unrealistic.

Pairing Protective DNS with predictive threat intelligence addresses this gap. Instead of waiting for reputation to “age in,” use earlier signals, such as newly observed domains and rapidly changing infrastructure, to make better decisions sooner.

DNS as a Channel for Exfiltration

Chris reminded attendees that DNS isn’t just a phone book—it’s a channel. Attackers hide data in queries and exfiltrate incrementally.

DNS is observable. Patterns such as repeated lookups to uncommon domains, abnormal query volumes or unusual timing are strong indicators for investigation.

Protective DNS and telemetry help identify these signals early, enabling faster containment.

Integrating Protective DNS into MSSP Services

Chris’s advice for MSSPs follows a managed-service playbook:

Position It as Prevention: Frame Protective DNS as baseline defense against phishing and malware, blocking attacks before they develop and reducing incidents requiring deep response.

Operationalize the Investigation: Treat DNS logs and telemetry as first-class data for incident response, enabling quick scoping, IoC hunts and early compromise indicators.

Alert the Ecosystem: Integrate DNS context into the broader security stack, including security information and event management (SIEM) and XDR, so that DNS-layer events appear alongside endpoint and network signals in unified investigations.

MSSP leaders and SOC managers should position Protective DNS strategically. Even strong endpoint and network controls benefit when DNS-layer policy provides the earliest threat interception and creates high-quality IoCs for faster investigations.

Start by mapping your incident response flow. Ask: Where do you already rely on DNS logs? How quickly could you block suspicious destinations at the DNS layer? How could predictive threat intelligence help you act earlier on brand-new attacker infrastructure?

[47] Infoblox Blog - IoT DNS Security and Privacy with UCL and Inria
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Wed, 18 Feb 2026 15:55:11 +0000

If we think about our home networks, we likely have more Internet of Things (IoT) and Operational Technology (OT) devices than traditional computers, and within enterprise networks these devices perform critical roles in security systems, building controls, manufacturing sensors and healthcare.

University College London (UCL) and the Institut national de recherche en sciences et technologies du numérique (Inria) have been collaborating on research into the security of these devices for some time. Using a large IoT testbed these organizations uncovered serious anomalies in the DNS behavior of these devices.

In the DNS world, IoT devices came to prominence in 2016 with the attack on Dyn, a major provider of DNS services. They suffered a massive distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack, disrupting access to major websites including Twitter, Spotify, Reddit, GitHub and Netflix. The attack was powered by the Mirai botnet, which hijacked thousands of insecure IoT devices. IoT botnet activity continues, as recently highlighted by Brian Krebs’ article on the Kimwolf Botnet.1

While the “normal” (bad) DNS behavior of devices and those of compromised devices are not directly related, there is an overlap in some of the mitigations that points us to how we can move toward security-by-design in the manufacture and operations of IoT. This article discusses the risks identified by the research, how these might be addressed and the mitigations network operators can use.

Using a large-scale IoT testbed, researchers at UCL and Inria analyzed 30 consumer IoT devices across categories such as cameras, doorbells, lights, sensors and medical devices.2 The methodology included passive traffic inspection and active testing.

Key findings included:

No support for Encrypted DNS (DoH/DoT/DoQ): This means queries would be visible, which could lead to device fingerprinting and privacy issues.

Hardcoded DNS Resolvers: Some devices ignored network DNS resolver settings and instead used well-known open DNS resolvers such as Google’s 8.8.8.8 DNS service. If this is permitted on a network, it would bypass local security controls or those a home network service provider is delivering to its customers. Conversely, if a device has a hardcoded resolver as shipped it may not work if that open resolver is blocked due to network policy.

Poor Source Randomization: Devices used predictable source ports and transaction IDs, increasing the risk of cache poisoning and spoofed responses.

No DNSSEC Adoption: None of the devices validated DNS responses, making them vulnerable to spoofing.

Time to Live (TTL) Mismanagement: Devices ignored TTL values, causing erratic query behavior and inefficiencies.

Fragmentation Issues: Limited support for Extension Mechanisms for DNS (EDNS0) UDP message size led to inefficient handling of large DNS queries that testing showed could lead to operational issues.

Andrew Losty, a PhD student at UCL and one of the Internet Draft authors, presented research findings at RIPE 91,3 and the slides and recording of this are available here. As one example, the following graph shows the lack of transaction ID randomization in some devices, making it more likely to accept a spoofed DNS response.

To address the DNS-related vulnerabilities uncovered in the UCL and Inria research, we are working together on an Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Best Current Practice draft via the IoT working group. This is the logical place for this work as the DNS protocol is developed within the IETF and the IoT working group has a focus on the management and operations of the types of devices tested.

Manufacturers of IoT/OT devices need to ensure adherence to the following:

Compliance to encrypted DNS standards such as DNS over TLS (DoT), DNS over HTTPS (DoH) or DNS over QUIC (DoQ) for enhanced privacy, security and compatibility

Support for the configuration of DNS servers manually, via device management software, IPv6 router advertisements, DHCP and discovery of designated resolver standards; devices should not have hardcoded resolvers for security and operational reasons.

DNS source port and transaction ID randomization to reduce the risk of spoofed responses being accepted by the device

Devices honoring DNS record TTL values, perhaps with a maximum for operational reasons, with manufacturers also setting management domain records to appropriate values

Support for EDNS0 to improve device efficiency and not impact the operation of a device when responses exceed the traditional 512 byte UDP limit

Develop support for DNSSEC, for instance checking the Authenticated Data bit in resolvers’ responses; manufacturers must sign their public zones used for device management and any data collection

More details can be found in the Internet Draft IoT DNS Security and Privacy Guidelines.4

Network Operator Mitigations

There are broadly two network operator types where IoT devices are deployed: service providers of consumer networks, for instance the networks we have at home, and organizations managing their own infrastructure. The main difference from a DNS perspective is that a consumer may use any DNS server, while an organization managing its own network should restrict DNS traffic to its own resolvers for security and policy reasons. In the consumer case it is advantageous for the end user to use the provider’s resolvers and most home networks would do this in any case.

Operators can restrict networks where IoT devices are deployed to only query domain names in management zones via Protective DNS.5 They can see what these are via analyzing DNS traffic, but we are calling on manufacturers to provide these, either by simply publishing them or via the use of the Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD) specification.6

This means that the networks would be operated on a Zero Trust DNS basis, along the lines of Microsoft’s Zero Trust DNS.7 This mitigates against devices being compromised, including in the supply chain.

Where DNS resolution needs to be more open, such as on consumer networks where any device can be deployed, the network operator can still use Protective DNS to block malicious domains used in the compromise or control of devices.

Operators should have resolvers validate responses via DNSSEC in any case, but specifically in the context of IoT it will allow devices to take advantage of manufacturers signing their public zones.

Regulation Improvements

Having improved standards that are enforced through certification will move us to a more secure-by-design paradigm.

While organizations such as ETSI, ISO/IEC, ITU-T and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) have varying amounts of guidance on DNS security as it applies to IoT/OT, there are certainly gaps here. Developing a Best Current Practice Draft within the IETF IoT Operations working group will allow this to be referenced by organizations such as ETSI where work for the certification of IoT devices is ongoing.

As an example, provision 5.5-5 in the ETSI EN 303 645 V3.1.3 (2024-09) standard states “Consumer IoT device functionality that allows security-relevant changes in configuration via a network interface shall only be accessible after authentication. The exception is for network service protocols that are relied upon by the consumer IoT device and where the manufacturer cannot guarantee what configuration will be required for the consumer IoT device to operate.” One of the exceptions is for DNS.

This should not exist as a blanket exemption. Rather than manufacturers complying with just device security, standards should consider the wider security context, especially where it is in same manufacturer’s control. The ETSI standard states “To increase security, multi-factor authentication, such as use of a password plus OTP procedure, can be used to better protect the consumer IoT device or an associated service.” The multi-factor authentication service and infrastructure is outside of the device and the manufacturer’s control, whereas public management domains can be cryptographically signed, and devices can check if this has been verified—all within one manufacturer’s control.

The natural tension in this is keeping regulation generic enough to allow for developments in tech and to document intent or outcomes versus being protocol specific. This is where IETF Drafts and RFCs can be referenced to bridge the gap and mean standards bodies do not need to maintain specific detail on protocol compliance.

The message can be boiled down to manufacturers following the DNS standards we already have (as detailed in the Draft we published), helping operators by providing management domain information to secure networks, pushing the use of PKI to manage devices in the form of DNSSEC (we do this with certs) and regulators referencing this in their standards.

As we continue to work on the Draft, turning research findings into actionable guidelines, we invite you to join the conversation via the IETF whether you’re a device manufacturer, network operator or security professional.

If you are a network operator or security professional there are some practices in the Draft that will improve network security and you can help practically, for instance ask the manufacturers of the devices you use to let you know the management domains names so you can lock down communications to only those domains via Protective DNS.
