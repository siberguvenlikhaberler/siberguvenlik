Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed details of a new Android trojan called Massiv that's designed to facilitate device takeover (DTO) attacks for financial theft.

The malware, according to ThreatFabric, masquerades as seemingly harmless IPTV apps to deceive victims, indicating that the activity is primarily singling out users looking for the online TV applications.

"This new threat, while only seen in a limited number of rather targeted campaigns, already poses a great risk to the users of mobile banking, allowing its operators to remotely control infected devices and perform device takeover attacks with further fraudulent transactions performed from the victim's banking accounts," the Dutch mobile security company said in a report shared with The Hacker News.

Like various Android banking malware families, Massiv supports a wide range of features to facilitate credential theft through a number of methods: screen streaming through Android's MediaProjection API, keylogging, SMS interception, and fake overlays served atop banking and financial apps. The overlay asks users to enter their credentials and credit card details.

One such campaign has been found to target gov.pt, a Portuguese public administration app that allows users to store identification documents and manage the Digital Mobile Key (aka Chave Móvel Digital or CMD). The overlay tricks users into entering their phone number and PIN code, likely in an effort to bypass Know Your Customer (KYC) verification.

ThreatFabric said it identified cases where scammers used the information captured through these overlays to open new banking accounts in the victim's name, allowing them to be used for money laundering or getting loans approved without the actual victim's knowledge.

In addition, it serves as a fully functional remote-control tool, granting the operator the ability to access the victim's device stealthily while showing a black screen overlay to conceal the malicious activity. These techniques, realized by abusing Android's accessibility services, have also been observed in several other Android bankers like Crocodilus, Datzbro, and Klopatra.

"However, some applications implement protection against screen capture," the company explained. "To bypass it, Massiv uses so-called UI-tree mode -- it traverses AccessibilityWindowInfo roots and recursively processes AccessibilityNodeInfo objects."

This is done so as to build a JSON representation of visible text and content descriptions, UI elements, screen coordinates, and interaction flags that indicate whether the UI element is clickable, editable, focused, or enabled. Only nodes that are visible and have text are exported to the attacker, who can then determine the next course of action by issuing specific commands to interact with the device.

The malware is equipped to carry out a wide range of malicious actions -

Enable black overlay, mute sounds and vibration

Send device information

Perform click and swipe actions

Alter clipboard with specific text

Turn on/off screen streaming

Unlock device with pattern

Serve overlays for an app, device pattern lock, or PIN

Download ZIP archive with overlays for targeted applications

Download and install APK files

Open Battery Optimization, Device Admin, and Play Protect settings screens

Rquest for permissions to access SMS messages, install APK packages,

Clear log databases on the device

Massiv is distributed in the form of dropper apps mimicking IPTV apps via SMS phishing. Once installed and launched, the dropper prompts the victim to install an "important" update by granting it permissions to install software from external sources. The names of the malicious artifacts are listed below -

IPTV24 (hfgx.mqfy.fejku) - Dropper

Google Play (hobfjp.anrxf.cucm) - Massiv

"In most of the cases observed, it is just masquerading," ThreatFabric said. "No actual IPTV applications were infected or initially contained malicious code. Usually, the dropper that mimics an IPTV app opens a WebView with an IPTV website in it, while the actual malware is already installed and running on the device."

The majority of Android malware campaigns using TV-related droppers have targeted Spain, Portugal, France, and Turkey over the past six months.

Massiv is the latest entrant to an already crowded Android threat landscape, reflecting the continuing demand for such turnkey solutions among cybercriminals.

"While not yet observed being promoted as Malware-as-a-Service, Massiv's operator shows clear signs of going this path, introducing API keys to be used in malware communication with the backend," ThreatFabric said. "Code analysis revealed ongoing development, with more features likely to be introduced in the future."

[2] The Hacker News - CRESCENTHARVEST Campaign Targets Iran Protest Supporters With RAT Malware
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[TAM METİN - 945 kelime]
Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed details of a new campaign dubbed CRESCENTHARVEST, likely targeting supporters of Iran's ongoing protests to conduct information theft and long-term espionage.

The Acronis Threat Research Unit (TRU) said it observed the activity after January 9, with the attacks designed to deliver a malicious payload that serves as a remote access trojan (RAT) and information stealer to execute commands, log keystrokes, and exfiltrate sensitive data. It's currently not known if any of the attacks were successful.

"The campaign exploits recent geopolitical developments to lure victims into opening malicious .LNK files disguised as protest-related images or videos," researchers Subhajeet Singha, Eliad Kimhy, and Darrel Virtusio said in a report published this week.

"These files are bundled with authentic media and a Farsi-language report providing updates from 'the rebellious cities of Iran.' This pro- protest framing appears to be intended to increase credibility and to attract Farsi-speaking Iranians seeking protest-related information."

CRESCENTHARVEST, although unattributed, is believed to be the work of an Iran-aligned threat group. The discovery makes it the second such campaign identified as going after specific individuals in the aftermath of the nationwide protests in Iran that began towards the end of 2025.

Last month, French cybersecurity company HarfangLab detailed a threat cluster dubbed RedKitten that targeted non-governmental organizations and individuals involved in documenting recent human rights abuses in Iran with an aim to infect them with a custom backdoor known as SloppyMIO.

According to Acronis, the exact initial access vector used to distribute the malware is not known. However, it's suspected that the threat actors are relying on spear-phishing or "protracted social engineering efforts" in which the operators build rapport with the victims over time before sending the malicious payloads.

It's worth noting that Iranian hacking groups like Charming Kitten and Tortoiseshell have a storied history of engaging in sophisticated social-engineered attacks that involve approaching prospective targets under fake personas and cultivating a relationship with them, in some cases even stretching for years, before weaponizing the trust to infect them with malware.

"The use of Farsi language content for social engineering and the distributed files depicting the protests in heroic terms suggest an intent to attract Farsi-speaking individuals of Iranian origin, who are in support of the ongoing protests," the Swiss-based security company noted.

The starting point of the attack chain is a malicious RAR archive that claims to contain information related to the Iranian protests, including various images and videos, along with two Windows shortcut (LNK) files that masquerade as an image or a video file by using the double extension trick (*.jpg.lnk or *.mp4.lnk).

The deceptive file, once launched, contains PowerShell code to retrieve another ZIP archive, while simultaneously opening a harmless image or video, tricking the victim into thinking that they have interacted with a benign file.

Present within the ZIP archive is a legitimate Google-signed binary ("software_reporter_tool.exe") shipped as part of Chrome's cleanup utility and several DLL files, including two rogue libraries that are sideloaded by the executable to realize the threat actor's objectives -

urtcbased140d_d.dll, a C++ implant that extracts and decrypts Chrome's app-bound encryption keys through COM interfaces. It shares overlaps with an open-source project known as ChromElevator.

version.dll (aka CRESCENTHARVEST), a remote access tool that lists installed antivirus products and security tools, enumerates local user accounts on the device, loads DLLs, harvests system metadata, browser credentials, Telegram desktop account data, and keystrokes.

CRESCENTHARVEST employs Windows Win HTTP APIs to communicate with its command-and-control (C2) server ("servicelog-information[.]com"), allowing it to blend in with regular traffic. Some of the supported commands are listed below -

Anti, to run anti-analysis checks

His, to steal browser history

Dir, to list directories

Cwd, to get the current working directory

Cd, to change directory

GetUser, to get user information

ps, to run PowerShell commands (not working)

KeyLog, to activate keylogger

Tel_s, to steal Telegram session data

Info, to steal system information

F_log, to steal browser credentials

Upload, to upload files

shell, to run shell commands

"The CRESCENTHARVEST campaign represents the latest chapter in a decade-long pattern of suspected nation-state cyber espionage operations targeting journalists, activists, researchers, and diaspora communities globally," Acronis said. "Much of what we observed in CRESCENTHARVEST reflects well-established tradecraft: LNK-based initial access, DLL side-loading through signed binaries, credential harvesting and social engineering aligned to current events."

The disclosure comes days after The New York Times revealed that Iran's government likely tracked protesters' locations through their phones to warn them over a text message that their "presence at illegal gatherings" had been recorded and that they were under "intelligence monitoring."

The move, it said, was an attempt to crack down dissent. According to a report published by Iran-focused digital rights group Holistic Resilience last week, some people who posted on social media about the protests and other political topics have had their SIM cards suspended.

"The Islamic Republic is building a distinct model of digital control and surveillance, one that is not based on permanent isolation but on conditional and interruptible connectivity," RaazNet said.

"The central pillar of this model is the National Information Network (NIN). Unlike traditional physical infrastructure, such as roads or factories, the NIN is not a static state project. Like other digital systems, it evolves continuously alongside advances in communications technologies, undergoes regular versioning, and is expanded in response to changing technical and political requirements."

The move is part of a broader effort that combines information gleaned from e-government databases, surveillance cameras, as well as malware deployed via social engineering to establish remote access and monitor its citizens' movements online in a sustained manner. One such tool is a lightweight modular trojan called 2Ac2 RAT that's designed for victim device control and data collection.

[3] The Hacker News - Citizen Lab Finds Cellebrite Tool Used on Kenyan Activist’s Phone in Police Custody
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[TAM METİN - 730 kelime]
New research from the Citizen Lab has found signs that Kenyan authorities used a commercial forensic extraction tool manufactured by Israeli company Cellebrite to break into a prominent dissident's phone, making it the latest case of abuse of the technology targeting civil society.

The interdisciplinary research unit at the University of Toronto's Munk School of Global Affairs & Public Policy said it found the indicators on a personal phone belonging to Boniface Mwangi, a Kenyan pro-democracy activist who has announced plans to run for president in 2027.

Specifically, it has emerged that Cellebrite's forensic extraction tools were used on his Samsung phone while it was in police custody following his arrest in July 2025.

The phone was returned to him nearly two months later, in September, at which point Mwangi found that the phone was no longer password-protected and could be unlocked without requiring a password. It's been assessed with high confidence that Cellebrite's technology was used on the phone on or around July 20 and July 21, 2025.

"The use of Cellebrite could have enabled the full extraction of all materials from Mwangi's device, including messages, private materials, personal files, financial information, passwords, and other sensitive information," the Citizen Lab said.

The latest findings follow a separate report released last month, in which the researchers said officials in Jordan likely used Cellebrite to extract information from the mobile phones of activists and human rights defenders who had been critical of Israel and spoke out in support of Palestinians in Gaza.

The devices were seized by Jordanian authorities during detentions, arrests, and interrogations, and subsequently returned to them. The documented incidents took place between late 2023 and mid-2025, the Citizen Lab said.

In response to the findings, a spokesperson for Cellebrite told The Guardian that the company's technology is used to "access private data only in accordance with legal due process or with appropriate consent to aid investigations legally after an event has occurred."

The two cases add to a growing body of evidence documenting the misuse of Cellebrite technology by government clients. It also reflects a broader ecosystem of surveillance abuses by various governments around the world to enable highly-targeted surveillance using mercenary spyware like Pegasus and Predator.

Predator Spyware Targets Angolan Journalist

The development also coincides with another report from Amnesty International, which discovered evidence that the iPhone belonging to Teixeira Cândido, an Angolan journalist and press freedom advocate, was successfully targeted by Intellexa's Predator spyware in May 2024 after he opened an infection link received via WhatsApp.

The iPhone was running iOS 16.2, an outdated version of the operating system with known security issues. It's currently not known what exploit was used to trigger the infection. In multiple reports published last year, Recorded Future revealed that it has observed suspected Predator operations in Angola dating back to 2024.

"This is the first forensically confirmed case of the Predator spyware being used to target civil society in Angola," the international human rights organization said. "Once the spyware was installed, the attacker could gain unrestricted access to Teixeira Cândido's iPhone."

"The Predator spyware infection appears to have lasted less than one day, with the infection being removed when Teixeira Cândido's phone was restarted in the evening of 4 May 2024. From that time until 16 June 2024, the attackers made 11 new attempts to re-infect the device by sending him new malicious Predator infection links. All of these subsequent attack attempts appear to have failed, likely due to the links simply not being opened."

According to an analysis published by French offensive security company Reverse Society, Predator is a commercial spyware product "built for reliable, long-term deployment" and allows operators to selectively enable or disable modules based on target activity, granting them real-time control over surveillance efforts.

Predator has also been found to incorporate various undocumented anti-analysis mechanisms, including a crash reporter monitoring system for anti-forensics and SpringBoard hooking to suppress recording indicators from victims when the microphone or camera is activated, illustrating the sophistication of the spyware. On top of that, it has explicit checks to avoid running in U.S. and Israeli locales.

"These findings demonstrate that Predator's operators have granular visibility into failed deployments, [...] enabling them to adapt their approaches for specific targets," Jamf Threat Labs researchers Shen Yuan and Nir Avraham said. "This error code system transforms failed deployments from black boxes into diagnostic events."

[4] The Hacker News - Grandstream GXP1600 VoIP Phones Exposed to Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Wed, 18 Feb 2026 22:05:00 +0530
Link: https://thehackernews.com/2026/02/grandstream-gxp1600-voip-phones-exposed.html

[TAM METİN - 448 kelime]
Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed a critical security flaw in the Grandstream GXP1600 series of VoIP phones that could allow an attacker to seize control of susceptible devices.

The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2026-2329, carries a CVSS score of 9.3 out of a maximum of 10.0. It has been described as a case of unauthenticated stack-based buffer overflow that could result in remote code execution.

"A remote attacker can leverage CVE-2026-2329 to achieve unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) with root privileges on a target device," Rapid7 researcher Stephen Fewer, who discovered and reported the bug on January 6, 2026, said.

According to the cybersecurity company, the issue is rooted in the device's web-based API service ("/cgi-bin/api.values.get") and is accessible in a default configuration without requiring authentication.

This endpoint is designed to fetch one or more configuration values from the phone, such as the firmware version number or the model, through a colon-delimited string in the "request" parameter (e.g., "request=68:phone_model"), which is then parsed to extract each identifier and append it to a 64 byte buffer on the stack.

"When appending another character to the small 64 byte buffer, no length check is performed to ensure that no more than 63 characters (plus the appended null terminator) are ever written to this buffer," Fewer explained. "Therefore, an attacker-controlled 'request' parameter can write past the bounds of the small 64 byte buffer on the stack, overflowing into adjacent stack memory."

This means that a malicious colon-delimited "request" parameter sent as part of an HTTP request to the "/cgi-bin/api.values.get" endpoint can be used to trigger a stack-based buffer overflow, allowing the threat actors to corrupt the stack contents and ultimately achieve remote code execution on the underlying operating system.

The vulnerability affects GXP1610, GXP1615, GXP1620, GXP1625, GXP1628, and GXP1630 models. It has been addressed as part of a firmware update (version 1.0.7.81) released late last month.

In a Metasploit exploit module developed by Rapid7, it has been demonstrated that the vulnerability could be exploited to gain root privileges on a vulnerable device and chain it with a post-exploitation component to extract credentials stored on a compromised device.

Furthermore, the remote code execution capabilities can be weaponized to reconfigure the target device to use a malicious Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) proxy, effectively enabling the attacker to intercept phone calls to and from the device and eavesdrop on VoIP conversations. A SIP proxy is an intermediary server in VoIP networks to establish and manage voice/video calls between endpoints.

"This isn't a one-click exploit with fireworks and a victory banner," Rapid7's Douglas McKee said. "But the underlying vulnerability lowers the barrier in a way that should concern anyone operating these devices in exposed or lightly-segmented environments."

[5] The Hacker News - Critical Flaws Found in Four VS Code Extensions with Over 125 Million Installs
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Wed, 18 Feb 2026 18:46:00 +0530
Link: https://thehackernews.com/2026/02/critical-flaws-found-in-four-vs-code.html

[TAM METİN - 403 kelime]
Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed multiple security vulnerabilities in four popular Microsoft Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extensions that, if successfully exploited, could allow threat actors to steal local files and execute code remotely.

The extensions, which have been collectively installed more than 125 million times, are Live Server, Code Runner, Markdown Preview Enhanced, and Microsoft Live Preview.

"Our research demonstrates that a hacker needs only one malicious extension, or a single vulnerability within one extension, to perform lateral movement and compromise entire organizations," OX Security researchers Moshe Siman Tov Bustan and Nir Zadok said in a report shared with The Hacker News.

Details of the vulnerabilities are as follows -

CVE-2025-65717 (CVSS score: 9.1) - A vulnerability in Live Server that allows attackers to exfiltrate local files, tricking a developer into visiting a malicious website when the extension is running, causing JavaScript embedded in the page to crawl and extract files from the local development HTTP server that runs at localhost:5500, and transmit them to a domain under their control. (Remains unpatched)

CVE-2025-65716 (CVSS score: 8.8) - A vulnerability in Markdown Preview Enhanced that allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code by uploading a crafted markdown (.md) file, allowing local port enumeration and exfiltration to a domain under their control. (Remains unpatched)

CVE-2025-65715 (CVSS score: 7.8) - A vulnerability in Code Runner that allows attackers to execute arbitrary code by convincing a user to alter the "settings.json" file through phishing or social engineering. (Remains unpatched)

A vulnerability in Microsoft Live Preview allows attackers to access sensitive files on a developer's machine by tricking a victim into visiting a malicious website when the extension is running, which then enables specially crafted JavaScript requests targeting the localhost to enumerate and exfiltrate sensitive files. (No CVE, Fixed silently by Microsoft in version 0.4.16 released in September 2025)

To secure the development environment, it's essential to avoid applying untrusted configurations, disable or uninstall non-essential extensions, harden the local network behind a firewall to restrict inbound and outbound connections, periodically update extensions, and turn off localhost-based services when not in use.

"Poorly written extensions, overly permissive extensions, or malicious ones can execute code, modify files, and allow attackers to take over a machine and exfiltrate information," OX Security said. "Keeping vulnerable extensions installed on a machine is an immediate threat to an organization's security posture: it may take only one click, or a downloaded repository, to compromise everything."

[6] The Hacker News - Cybersecurity Tech Predictions for 2026: Operating in a World of Permanent Instability
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Wed, 18 Feb 2026 17:28:00 +0530
Link: https://thehackernews.com/2026/02/cybersecurity-tech-predictions-for-2026.html

[TAM METİN - 1765 kelime]
In 2025, navigating the digital seas still felt like a matter of direction. Organizations charted routes, watched the horizon, and adjusted course to reach safe harbors of resilience, trust, and compliance.

In 2026, the seas are no longer calm between storms. Cybersecurity now unfolds in a state of continuous atmospheric instability: AI-driven threats that adapt in real time, expanding digital ecosystems, fragile trust relationships, persistent regulatory pressure, and accelerating technological change. This is not turbulence on the way to stability; it is the climate.

In this environment, cybersecurity technologies are no longer merely navigational aids. They are structural reinforcements. They determine whether an organization endures volatility or learns to function normally within it. That is why security investments in 2026 are increasingly made not for coverage, but for operational continuity: sustained operations, decision-grade visibility and controlled adaptation as conditions shift.

This article is less about what’s “next-gen” and more about what becomes non-negotiable when conditions keep changing. The shifts that will steer cybersecurity priorities and determine which investments hold when conditions turn.

Regulation and geopolitics become architectural constraints

Regulation is no longer something security reacts to. It is something systems are built to withstand continuously.

Cybersecurity is now firmly anchored at the intersection of technology, regulation and geopolitics. Privacy laws, digital sovereignty requirements, AI governance frameworks and sector-specific regulations no longer sit on the side as periodic compliance work; they operate as permanent design parameters, shaping where data can live, how it can be processed and what security controls are acceptable by default.

At the same time, geopolitical tensions increasingly translate into cyber pressure: supply-chain exposure, jurisdictional risk, sanctions regimes and state-aligned cyber activity all shape the threat landscape as much as vulnerabilities do.

As a result, cybersecurity strategies must integrate regulatory and geopolitical considerations directly into architecture and technology decisions, rather than treating them as parallel governance concerns.

Changing the conditions: Making the attack surface unreliable

Traditional cybersecurity often tried to forecast specific events: the next exploit, the next malware campaign, the next breach. But in an environment where signals multiply, timelines compress and AI blurs intent and scale, those forecasts decay quickly. The problem isn’t that prediction is useless. It’s that it expires faster than defenders can operationalize it.

So the advantage shifts. Instead of trying to guess the next move, the stronger strategy is to shape the conditions attackers need to succeed.

Attackers depend on stability: time to map systems, test assumptions, gather intelligence and establish persistence. The modern counter-move is to make that intelligence unreliable and short-lived. By using tools like Automated Moving Target Defense (AMTD) to dynamically alter system and network parameters, Advanced Cyber Deception that diverts adversaries away from critical systems, or Continuous Threat Exposure Management (CTEM) to map exposure and reduce exploitability, defenders shrink the window in which an intrusion chain can be assembled.

This is where security becomes less about “detect and respond” and more about deny, deceive and disrupt before an attacker’s plan becomes momentum.

The goal is simple: shorten the shelf-life of attacker knowledge until planning becomes fragile, persistence becomes expensive and “low-and-slow” stops paying off.

AI becomes the acceleration layer of the cyber control plane

AI is no longer a feature layered on top of security tools. It is increasingly infused inside them across prevention, detection, response, posture management and governance.

The practical shift is not “more alerts,” but less friction: faster correlation, better prioritization and shorter paths from raw telemetry to usable decisions.

The SOC becomes less of an alert factory and more of a decision engine, with AI accelerating triage, enrichment, correlation and the translation of scattered signals into a coherent narrative. Investigation time compresses because context arrives faster and response becomes more orchestrated because routine steps can be drafted, sequenced and executed with far less manual stitching.

But the bigger story is what happens outside the SOC. AI is increasingly used to improve the efficiency and quality of cybersecurity controls: asset and data discovery become faster and more accurate; posture management becomes more continuous and less audit-driven; policy and governance work becomes easier to standardize and maintain. Identity operations, in particular, benefit from AI-assisted workflows that improve provisioning hygiene, strengthen recertification by focusing reviews on meaningful risk and reduce audit burden by accelerating evidence collection and anomaly detection.

This is the shift that matters. Security programs stop spending energy assembling complexity and start spending it steering outcomes.

Security becomes a lifecycle discipline across digital ecosystems

Most breaches do not start with a vulnerability. They start with an architectural decision made months earlier.

Cloud platforms, SaaS ecosystems, APIs, identity federation and AI services continue to expand digital environments at a faster rate than traditional security models can absorb. The key shift is not merely that the attack surface grows, but that interconnectedness changes what “risk” means.

Security is therefore becoming a lifecycle discipline: integrated throughout the entire system lifecycle, not just development. It starts at architecture and procurement, continues through integration and configuration, extends into operations and change management and is proven during incidents and recovery.

In practice, that means the lifecycle now includes what modern ecosystems are actually made of: secure-by-design delivery through the SDLC and digital supply chain security to manage the risks inherited from third-party software, cloud services and dependencies.

Leading organizations move away from security models focused on isolated components or single phases. Instead, security is increasingly designed as an end-to-end capability that evolves with the system, rather than trying to bolt on controls after the fact.

Zero Trust as a continuous decisioning and adaptive control

In a world where the perimeter dissolved long ago, Zero Trust stops being a strategy and becomes the default infrastructure. Especially as trust itself becomes dynamic.

The key shift is that access is no longer treated as a one-time gate. Zero Trust increasingly means continuous decisioning: permission is evaluated repeatedly, not granted once. Identity, device posture, session risk, behavior and context become live inputs into decisions that can tighten, step up, or revoke access as conditions change.

With identity designed as a dynamic control plane, Zero Trust expands beyond users to include non-human identities such as service accounts, workload identities, API tokens and OAuth grants. This is why identity threat detection and response becomes essential: detecting token abuse, suspicious session behavior and privilege path anomalies early, then containing them fast. Continuous authorization makes stolen credentials less durable, limits how far compromise can travel and reduces the Time-To-Detection dependency by increasing the Time-To-Usefulness friction for attackers. Segmentation then does the other half of the job by keeping local compromise from turning into systemic spread by containing the blast radius by design.

The most mature Zero Trust programs stop measuring success by deployment milestones and start measuring it by operational outcomes: how quickly access can be constrained when risk rises, how fast sessions can be invalidated, how small the blast radius remains when an identity is compromised and how reliably sensitive actions require stronger proof than routine access.

Data security and privacy engineering unlock scalable AI

Data is the foundation of digital value and simultaneously the fastest path to regulatory, ethical and reputational damage. That tension is why data security and privacy engineering are becoming non-negotiable foundations, not governance add-ons. When organizations can’t answer basic questions such as what data exists, where it lives, who can access it, what is it used for and how it moves, every initiative built on data becomes fragile. This is what ultimately determines whether AI projects can scale without turning into a liability.

Data security programs must evolve from “protect what we can see” to govern how the business actually uses data. That means building durable foundations around visibility (discovery, classification, lineage), ownership, enforceable access and retention rules and protections that follow data across cloud, SaaS, platforms and partners. A practical way to build this capability is through a Data Security Maturity Model to identify gaps across the core building blocks, prioritize what to strengthen first and initiate a maturity journey toward consistent, measurable and continuous data protection throughout its lifecycle.

Privacy engineering becomes also the discipline that makes those foundations usable and scalable. It shifts privacy from documentation to design through purpose-based access, minimization by default and privacy-by-design patterns embedded in delivery teams. The result is data that can move quickly with guardrails, without turning growth into hidden liability.

Post-Quantum Risk makes crypto agility a design requirement

Quantum computing is still emerging, but its security impact is already tangible because adversaries plan around time. “Harvest now, decrypt later” turns encrypted traffic collected now into future leverage. “Trust now, forge later” carries the same logic into trust systems: certificates, signed code and long-lived signatures that anchor security decisions today could become vulnerable later.

Governments have understood this timing problem and started to put dates on it, with first milestones as early as 2026 for EU governments and critical infrastructure operators to develop national post-quantum roadmaps and cryptographic inventories. Even if the rules start in the public sector, they travel fast through the supply chain and into the private sector.

This is why crypto agility becomes a design requirement rather than a future upgrade project. Cryptography is not a single control in one place. It is embedded across protocols, applications, identity systems, certificates, hardware, third-party products and cloud services. If an organization cannot rapidly locate where cryptography lives, understand what it protects and change it without breaking operations, it is not “waiting for PQC.” It is accumulating cryptographic debt under a regulatory clock.

Post-quantum preparedness therefore becomes less about picking replacement algorithms and more about building the ability to evolve: cryptographic asset visibility, disciplined key and certificate lifecycle management, upgradable trust anchors where possible and architectures that can rotate algorithms and parameters without disruption.

Cryptographic risk is no longer a future problem. It is a present design decision with long-term consequences.

Taken together, these shifts change what “good” looks like.

Security stops being judged by how much it covers and starts being judged by what it enables: resilience, clarity and controlled adaptation when conditions refuse to cooperate.

The strongest security programs are not the most rigid ones. They are the ones that adapt without losing control.

The digital environment does not promise stability, but it does reward preparation. Organizations that integrate security across the system lifecycle, treat data as a strategic asset, engineer for cryptographic evolution and reduce human friction are better positioned to operate with confidence in a world that keeps shifting.

Turbulence is no longer exceptional. It’s the baseline. The organizations that succeed are the ones designed to operate anyway.

A maximum severity security vulnerability in Dell RecoverPoint for Virtual Machines has been exploited as a zero-day by a suspected China-nexus threat cluster dubbed UNC6201 since mid-2024, according to a new report from Google Mandiant and Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG).

The activity involves the exploitation of CVE-2026-22769 (CVSS score: 10.0), a case of hard-coded credentials affecting versions prior to 6.0.3.1 HF1. Other products, including RecoverPoint Classic, are not vulnerable to the flaw.

"This is considered critical as an unauthenticated remote attacker with knowledge of the hardcoded credential could potentially exploit this vulnerability, leading to unauthorized access to the underlying operating system and root-level persistence," Dell said in a bulletin released Tuesday.

The issue impacts the following products -

RecoverPoint for Virtual Machines Version 5.3 SP4 P1 - Migrate from RecoverPoint for Virtual Machines 5.3 SP4 P1 to 6.0 SP3, and then upgrade to 6.0.3.1 HF1

RecoverPoint for Virtual Machines Versions 6.0, 6.0 SP1, 6.0 SP1 P1, 6.0 SP1 P2, 6.0 SP2, 6.0 SP2 P1, 6.0 SP3, and 6.0 SP3 P1 - Upgrade to 6.0.3.1 HF1

RecoverPoint for Virtual Machines Versions 5.3 SP4, 5.3 SP3, 5.3 SP2, and earlier - Upgrade to version 5.3 SP4 P1 or a 6.x version, and then apply the necessary remediation

"Dell recommends that RecoverPoint for Virtual Machines be deployed within a trusted, access-controlled internal network protected by appropriate firewalls and network segmentation," it noted. "RecoverPoint for Virtual Machines is not intended for use on untrusted or public networks."

"We are aware of less than a dozen impacted organizations, but because the full scale of this campaign is unknown, we recommend that organizations previously targeted by BRICKSTORM look out for GRIMBOLT in their environments," Rich Reece, Manager, Mandiant Consulting at Google Cloud, told The Hacker News via email.

Mandiant said it discovered CVE-2026-22769 earlier this year while investigating multiple Dell RecoverPoint for Virtual Machines within an unspecified victim's environment.

"The actor is likely still active in unpatched and remediated environments, and because exploitation has been occurring since mid-2024, they have had significant time to establish persistence and carry out long-term espionage," Reece said. "We anticipate additional companies will find active or historic compromises as they begin hunting using the new IOCs/YARA rules we published."

Per Google, the hard-coded credential relates to an "admin" user for the Apache Tomcat Manager instance that could be used authenticate to the Dell RecoverPoint Tomcat Manager, upload a web shell named SLAYSTYLE via the "/manager/text/deploy" endpoint, and execute commands as root on the appliance to drop the BRICKSTORM backdoor and its newer version dubbed GRIMBOLT.

"This is a C# backdoor compiled using native ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation, making it harder to reverse engineer," Mandiant's Charles Carmakal added.

Google told The Hacker News that the activity has targeted organizations across North America, with GRIMBOLT incorporating features to better evade detection and minimize forensic traces on infected hosts. "GRIMBOLT is even better at blending in with the system's own native files," it added.

UNC6201 is also assessed to share overlaps with UNC5221, another China-nexus espionage cluster known for its exploitation of virtualization technologies and Ivanti zero-day vulnerabilities to distribute web shells and malware families like BEEFLUSH, BRICKSTORM, and ZIPLINE.

Despite the tactical similarities, the two clusters are assessed to be distinct at this stage. It's worth noting that the use of BRICKSTORM has also been linked by CrowdStrike to a third China-aligned adversary tracked as Warp Panda in attacks aimed at U.S. entities.

A noteworthy aspect of the latest set of attacks revolves around UNC6201's reliance on temporary virtual network interfaces – referred to as "Ghost NICs" – to pivot from compromised virtual machines into internal or SaaS environments, and then delete those NICs to cover up the tracks in an effort to impede investigation efforts.

"Consistent with the earlier BRICKSTORM campaign, UNC6201 continues to target appliances that typically lack traditional endpoint detection and response (EDR) agents to remain undetected for long periods," Google said.

Exactly how initial access is obtained remains unclear, but like UNC5221, it's also known to target edge appliances to break into target networks. An analysis of the compromised VMware vCenter appliances has also uncovered iptable commands executed by means of the web shell to perform the following set of actions -

Monitor incoming traffic on port 443 for a specific HEX string

Add the source IP address of that traffic to a list and if the IP address is on the list and connects to port 10443, the connection is ACCEPTED

Silently redirect subsequent traffic to port 443 to port 10443 for the next 300 seconds (five minutes) if the IP is on the approved list

Furthermore, the threat actor has been found replacing old BRICKSTORM binaries with GRIMBOLT in September 2025. While GRIMBOLT also provides a remote shell capability and uses the same command-and-control (C2) as BRICKSTORM, it's not known what prompted the shift to the harder-to-detect malware, and whether it was a planned transition or a response to public disclosures about BRICKSTORM.

"Nation-state threat actors continue targeting systems that don't commonly support EDR solutions, which makes it very hard for victim organizations to know they are compromised and significantly prolongs intrusion dwell times," Carmakal said.

The disclosure comes as Dragos warned of attacks mounted by Chinese groups like Volt Typhoon (aka Voltzite) to compromise Sierra Wireless Airlink gateways located in electric and oil and gas sectors, followed by pivoting to engineering workstations to dump config and alarm data.

The activity, according to the cybersecurity company, took place in July 2025. The hacking crew is said to acquire initial access from Sylvanite, which rapidly weaponizes edge device vulnerabilities before patches are applied and hands off access for deeper operational technology (OT) intrusions.

"Voltzite moved beyond data exfiltration to direct manipulation of engineering workstations investigating what would trigger processes to stop," Dragos said. " This represents the removal of the last practical barrier between having access and causing physical consequences. Cellular gateways create unauthorized pathways into OT networks bypassing traditional security controls."

The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), on February 18, 2026, added CVE-2026-22769 to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, requiring Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to apply the patch by February 21, 2026.

[8] The Hacker News - 3 Ways to Start Your Intelligent Workflow Program 
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Wed, 18 Feb 2026 16:00:00 +0530
Link: https://thehackernews.com/2026/02/3-ways-to-start-your-intelligent.html

[TAM METİN - 781 kelime]
Security, IT, and engineering teams today are under relentless pressure to accelerate outcomes, cut operational drag, and unlock the full potential of AI and automation. But simply investing in tools isn’t enough. 88% of AI proofs-of-concept never make it to production, even though 70% of workers cite freeing time for high-value work as the primary AI automation motivation. Real impact comes from intelligent workflows that combine automation, AI-driven decisioning, and human ingenuity into seamless processes that work across teams and systems.

In this article, we’ll highlight three use cases across Security and IT that can serve as powerful starting points for your intelligent workflow program. For each use case, we’ll share a pre-built workflow to help you tackle real bottlenecks in your organization with automation while connecting directly into your existing tech stack. These use cases are great starting points to help you turn theory into practice and achieve measurable gains from day one.

Workflow #1 Automated Phishing Response

For security teams, responding to phishing emails can be a slow, burdensome process given the number of alerts and the growing sophistication of phishing attacks. By streamlining phishing analysis with automated workflows, security teams of all sizes get time back to focus on more critical issues and alerts.

Our first workflow, Analyze phishing email senders, URLs, and attachments, uses VirusTotal, URLScan.io, and Sublime Security to analyze key aspects of phishing emails such as file attachments, website behavior, email sender reputation, and detection rule matching. It then consolidates all of the results and displays them in a Tines page, which can be sent via email for archiving or further analysis.

Workflow #2 Agents for IT Service Request Automation

IT service desks are often overwhelmed with repetitive, time-consuming requests like password resets, software access provisioning, hardware troubleshooting, and account management. These tasks pull valuable technical resources away from strategic initiatives. When AI agents are deployed to handle these routine service requests, organizations can dramatically reduce response times from hours to seconds, be more likely to ensure 24/7 availability, and free IT teams to focus on complex problems that require human expertise.

The Automate IT service requests using Slack and agents workflow creates AI agents to categorize and process IT service requests. From a Slack message, the workflow categorizes requests into 3 categories: password resets, application access, or another action. Each request is then handled by a specialized agent.

The password reset agent verifies user identity and management relationships before processing. The application request agent identifies the correct application owner and facilitates access. Responses are handled over Slack, creating a self-serve flow that reduces manual IT involvement while letting teams decide when AI acts and when humans stay in the loop.

Workflow #3 Monitor and Manage Vulnerabilities

Security teams face an unrelenting stream of newly disclosed vulnerabilities. CISA's Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog is updated continuously as threat actors actively weaponize critical flaws. Automating the connection between vulnerability intelligence feeds and your asset inventory transforms this reactive scramble into a proactive rather than reactive defense. By automating the vulnerability detection process, security teams can cut response windows from days to minutes, and ensure they prioritize patching efforts based on real exposure rather than theoretical risk.

Without automation, organizations rely on manual monitoring of security bulletins, time-consuming spreadsheet comparisons between vulnerability databases and asset inventories, and delayed communications that leave critical gaps unaddressed while attackers move at machine speed. The result is increased breach risk, compliance failures, and security teams buried in manual triage work instead of strategic threat hunting and remediation.

The Check for new CISA vulnerabilities workflow monitors the CISA Vulnerability RSS feed and then uses the Tenable Vulnerability Management platform to check for any vulnerable systems. If vulnerabilities are detected, a message is sent via Microsoft Teams.

Intelligent Workflows that Keep Humans in the Loop

Intelligent workflows aren’t about replacing people, they’re about amplifying them. The three workflows above demonstrate how you can quickly move from isolated automation to connected, intelligent systems that blend AI, integrations, and human oversight to solve real operational problems.

Whether you’re responding to security threats, streamlining IT requests, or improving visibility into risk, these pre-built workflows provide practical, production-ready foundations you can adapt and extend as your needs evolve.

Tines’ intelligent workflow platform unites automation, AI agents, and human-in-the-loop controls to reduce repetitive “muckwork,” speed execution, and free teams to focus on higher-value work — while ensuring governance, integration, and scale so pilots don’t stall before they realize true value.

Get started today with one of these pre-built workflows or another from our broader story library. Prove the value first-hand and use it as a blueprint to scale an intelligent workflow program that drives meaningful impact across your organization.

[9] The Hacker News - Notepad++ Fixes Hijacked Update Mechanism Used to Deliver Targeted Malware
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Wed, 18 Feb 2026 13:10:00 +0530

[TAM METİN - 373 kelime]
Notepad++ has released a security fix to plug gaps that were exploited by an advanced threat actor from China to hijack the software update mechanism to selectively deliver malware to targets of interest.

The version 8.9.2 update incorporates what maintainer Don Ho calls a "double lock" design that aims to make the update process "robust and effectively unexploitable." This includes verification of the signed installer downloaded from GitHub (implemented in version 8.8.9 and later), as well as the newly added verification of the signed XML returned by the update server at notepad-plus-plus[.]org.

In addition to these enhancements, security-focused changes have been introduced to WinGUp, the auto-updater component -

Removal of libcurl.dll to eliminate DLL side-loading risk

Removal of two unsecured cURL SSL options: CURLSSLOPT_ALLOW_BEAST and CURLSSLOPT_NO_REVOKE

Restriction of plugin management execution to programs signed with the same certificate as WinGUp

The update also addresses a high-severity vulnerability (CVE-2026-25926, CVSS score: 7.3) that could result in arbitrary code execution in the context of the running application.

"An Unsafe Search Path vulnerability (CWE-426) exists when launching Windows Explorer without an absolute executable path," Ho said. "This may allow execution of a malicious explorer.exe if an attacker can control the process working directory. Under certain conditions, this could lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the running application."

The development comes weeks after Notepad++ disclosed that a breach at the hosting provider level enabled threat actors to hijack update traffic starting June 2025 and redirect requests from certain users to malicious servers to serve a poisoned update. The issue was detected in early December 2025.

According to Rapid7 and Kaspersky, the tampered updates enabled the attackers to deliver a previously undocumented backdoor dubbed Chrysalis. The supply chain incident, tracked under the CVE identifier CVE-2025-15556 (CVSS score: 7.7), has been attributed to a China-nexus hacking group called Lotus Panda.

The attack is assessed to have targeted individuals and organizations located in Vietnam, El Salvador, Australia, the Philippines, the U.S., South America, and Europe, spanning cloud hosting, energy, financial, government, manufacturing, and software development sectors, per data from Kaspersky and Palo Alto Networks Unit 42.

Notepad++ users are recommended to update to version 8.9.2, and make sure that the installers are downloaded from the official domain.

[TAM METİN - 406 kelime]
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) on Tuesday added four security flaws to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, citing evidence of active exploitation in the wild.

The list of vulnerabilities is as follows -

CVE-2026-2441 (CVSS score: 8.8) - A use-after-free vulnerability in Google Chrome that could allow a remote attacker to potentially exploit heap corruption via a crafted HTML page.

CVE-2024-7694 (CVSS score: 7.2) - An arbitrary file upload vulnerability in TeamT5 ThreatSonar Anti-Ransomware versions 3.4.5 and earlier that could allow an attacker to upload malicious files and achieve arbitrary system command execution on the server.

CVE-2020-7796 (CVSS score: 9.8) - A server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in Synacor Zimbra Collaboration Suite (ZCS) that could allow an attacker to send a crafted HTTP request to a remote host and obtain unauthorized access to sensitive information.

CVE-2008-0015 (CVSS score: 8.8) - A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in Microsoft Windows Video ActiveX Control that could allow an attacker to achieve remote code execution by setting up a specially crafted web page.

The addition of CVE-2026-2441 to the KEV catalog comes days after Google acknowledged that "an exploit for CVE-2026-2441 exists in the wild." It's currently not known how the vulnerability is being weaponized, but such information is typically withheld until a majority of the users are updated with a fix so as to prevent other threat actors from joining the exploitation bandwagon.

As for CVE-2020-7796, a report published by threat intelligence firm GreyNoise in March 2025 revealed that a cluster of about 400 IP addresses was actively exploiting multiple SSRF vulnerabilities, including CVE-2020-7796, to target susceptible instances in the U.S., Germany, Singapore, India, Lithuania, and Japan.

"When a user visits a web page containing an exploit detected as Exploit:JS/CVE-2008-0015, it may connect to a remote server and download other malware," Microsoft notes in its threat encyclopedia. It also said it's aware of cases where the exploit is used to download and execute Dogkild, a worm that propagates via removable drives.

The worm comes with capabilities to retrieve and run additional binaries, overwrite certain system files, terminate a long list of security-related processes, and even replace the Windows Hosts file in an attempt to prevent users from accessing websites associated with security programs.

It's presently unclear how the TeamT5 ThreatSonar Anti-Ransomware vulnerability is being exploited. Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies are recommended to apply the necessary fixes by March 10, 2026, for optimal protection.

[11] BleepingComputer - New 'Massiv' Android banking malware poses as an IPTV app

[TAM METİN - 526 kelime]
A new Android banking malware, which researchers named Massiv, is posing as an IPTV app to steal digital identities and access online banking accounts.

The malware relies on screen overlays and keylogging to obtain sensitive data and can take remote control of a compromised device.

In a campaign observed by researchers at fraud detection and mobile threat intelligence company ThreatFabric, Massiv targeted a Portuguese government app that connects with Chave Móvel Digital - Portugal’s digital authentication and signature system.

The two service contain user data that could be used to bypass know-your-customer (KYC) verifications or to access banking accounts and other public and private online services.

“MTI research identified cases where new accounts were opened in the name of the victim (user of the infected device) in new banks and services (not used by the victim),” describes the ThreatFabric report.

“Since those accounts are fully under fraudster control, they can further use them as a part of money laundering scheme as well as getting loans and cashing out the money, leaving unsuspecting victim in debts in the bank they never opened account themselves.”

Massiv provides two remote control modes for its operators: a screen live-streaming mode that leverages Android’s MediaProjection API, and a UI-tree mode that extracts structured data from the Accessibility Service.

The latter includes visible text, interface element names, screen coordinates, and interaction attributes, allowing attackers to click buttons, edit text fields, and more.

This second mode is particularly helpful for bypassing screen-capture protections commonly used in banking, communication, and other apps that host sensitive content.

IPTV lures on the rise

An interesting trend identified by ThreatFabric through the discovery of Massiv is the increasing use of IPTV apps as lures for Android malware infections, a technique that has increased over the past eight months.

These apps typically play a key role in copyright infringement, so they cannot be found on Google Play due to policy violations. Sourcing them as APKs from unofficial channels is considered normal for their users, who are accustomed to sideloading them.

In most cases, the IPTV app is fake, does not offer access to pirated broadcasts, and the APK is a dropper that installs the malware payload. In some cases, the app displays a legitimate IPTV website in a WebView to maintain the illusion.

The researchers report that fake IPTV-masking malware droppers have primarily targeted users in Spain, Portugal, France, and Turkey.

Android users are recommended to only download vetted apps from reputable publishers available on official channels (Google Play), keep Play Protect active, and use it to regularly scan the device.

[TAM METİN - 387 kelime]
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is warning of a critical vulnerability in multiple Honeywell CCTV products that allows unauthorized access to feeds or account hijacking.

Discovered by researcher Souvik Kanda and tracked as CVE-2026-1670, the security issue is classified as “missing authentication for critical function,” and received a crtical severity score of 9.8.

The flaw allows an unauthenticated attacker to change the recovery email address associated with a device account, enabling account takeover and unauthorized access to camera feeds.

“The affected product is vulnerable to an unauthenticated API endpoint exposure, which may allow an attacker to remotely change the "forgot password" recovery email address,” CISA says.

According to the security advisory, CVE-2026-1670 impacts the following models:

I-HIB2PI-UL 2MP IP 6.1.22.1216

SMB NDAA MVO-3 WDR_2MP_32M_PTZ_v2.0

PTZ WDR 2MP 32M WDR_2MP_32M_PTZ_v2.0

25M IPC WDR_2MP_32M_PTZ_v2.0

Honeywell is a major global supplier of security and video surveillance equipment with a broad range of CCTV camera models and related products deployed in commercial, industrial, and critical infrastructure settings worldwide.

The company offers many NDAA-compliant cameras that are suitable for deployment in U.S. government agencies and federal contractors.

The specific model families named in CISA’s advisory are mid-level video surveillance products used in small to medium business environments, offices, and warehouses, some of which may be part of critical facilities.

CISA stated that as of February 17th there were no known reports of public exploitation specifically targeting this vulnerability.

Nonetheless, the agency recommends minimizing network exposure of control system devices, isolating them behind firewalls, and using secure remote access methods such as updated VPN solutions when remote connectivity is necessary.

Honeywell has not published an advisory on CVE-2026-1670, but users are advised to contact the company’s support team for patch guidance.

[13] BleepingComputer - AI platforms can be abused for stealthy malware communication
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Wed, 18 Feb 2026 15:18:24 -0500
Link: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ai-platforms-can-be-abused-for-stealthy-malware-communication/

[TAM METİN - 666 kelime]
AI assistants like Grok and Microsoft Copilot with web browsing and URL-fetching capabilities can be abused to intermediate command-and-control (C2) activity.

Researchers at cybersecurity company Check Point discovered that threat actors can use AI services to relay communication between the C2 server and the target machine.

Attackers can exploit this mechanism to deliver commands and retrieve stolen data from victim systems.

The researchers created a proof-of-concept to show how it all works and disclosed their findings to Microsoft and xAI.

AI as a stealthy relay

Instead of malware connecting directly to a C2 server hosted on the attacker's infrastructure, Check Point’s idea was to have it communicate with an AI web interface, instructing the agent to fetch an attacker-controlled URL and receive the response in the AI’s output.

In Check Point's scenario, the malware interacts with the AI service using the WebView2 component in Windows 11. The researchers say that even if the component is missing on the target system, the threat actor can deliver it embedded in the malware.

WebView2 is used by developers to show web content in the interface of native desktop applications, thus eliminating the need of a full-featured browser.

The researchers created "a C++ program that opens a WebView pointing to either Grok or Copilot." This way, the attacker can submit to the assistant instructions that can include commands to be executed or extract information from the compromised machine.

The webpage responds with embedded instructions that the attacker can change at will, which the AI extracts or summarizes in response to the malware’s query.

The malware parses the AI assistant's response in the chat and extracts the instructions.

This creates a bidirectional communication channel via the AI service, which is trusted by internet security tools and can thus help carry out data exchanges without being flagged or blocked.

Check Point’s PoC, tested on Grok and Microsoft Copilot, does not require an account or API keys for the AI services, making traceability and primary infrastructure blocks less of a problem.

“The usual downside for attackers [abusing legitimate services for C2] is how easily these channels can be shut down: block the account, revoke the API key, suspend the tenant,” explains Check Point.

“Directly interacting with an AI agent through a web page changes this. There is no API key to revoke, and if anonymous usage is allowed, there may not even be an account to block.”

The researchers explain that safeguards exist to block obviously malicious exchanges on the said AI platforms, but these safety checks can be easily bypassed by encrypting the data into high-entropy blobs.

CheckPoint argues that AI as a C2 proxy is just one of multiple options for abusing AI services, which could include operational reasoning such as assessing if the target system is worth exploiting and how to proceed without raising alarms.

BleepingComputer has contacted Microsoft to ask whether Copilot is still exploitable in the way demonstrated by Check Point and the safeguards that could prevent such attacks, and a spokesperson responded with the following:

“We appreciate Check Point Research for identifying and responsibly reporting this proof of concept. As with any compromised device, attackers may attempt to communicate using a variety of available services, including AI-based services. We recommend users implement defense-in-depth security practices, which are designed to help prevent the initial malware infection and reduce the impact of post-compromise activity.” – a Microsoft spokesperson

[14] BleepingComputer - Telegram channels expose rapid weaponization of SmarterMail flaws
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Wed, 18 Feb 2026 11:27:38 -0500
Link: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/telegram-channels-expose-rapid-weaponization-of-smartermail-flaws/

[TAM METİN - 1215 kelime]
Flare researchers monitoring underground Telegram channels and cybercrime forums have observed threat actors rapidly sharing proof-of-concept exploits, offensive tools, and stolen administrator credentials related to recently disclosed SmarterMail vulnerabilities, providing insight into how quickly attackers weaponize new security flaws.

The activity occurred within days of the vulnerabilities being disclosed, with threat actors sharing and selling exploit code and compromised access tied to CVE-2026-24423 and CVE-2026-23760, critical flaws that enable remote code execution and authentication bypass on exposed email servers.

These vulnerabilities have since been confirmed in real-world attacks, including ransomware campaigns, highlighting how attackers increasingly target email infrastructure as an initial access point into corporate networks, allowing them to move laterally and establish persistent footholds.

CVE-2026-24423 and CVE-2026-23760: Critical RCE and Auth Bypass Flaws

Multiple recently disclosed SmarterMail vulnerabilities created a perfect storm that made the platform highly attractive to attackers. Among them, CVE-2026-24423 stands out as a critical unauthenticated remote code execution flaw affecting versions prior to Build 9511.

With a CVSS score of 9.3 and no user interaction required, the flaw is particularly suited for automation, large-scale scanning, and mass exploitation campaigns.

In parallel, additional vulnerabilities CVE-2026-23760 (CVSS 9.3) include authentication bypass and password reset logic flaws. It allows attackers to reset administrator credentials or gain privileged access to the platform. Research also shows that attackers were quickly reverse-engineering patches to identify and weaponize these weaknesses within days of release.

When combined, these issues enabled full server takeover scenarios, where attackers could move from application-level access to operating system control and potentially domain-level compromise in connected environments.

From an attacker’s perspective, this combination is ideal: SmarterMail is a network-exposed service, often holds a high trust position inside enterprise environments, and in many cases is monitored less aggressively than endpoint systems protected by EDR.

Once proof-of-concept exploit code becomes available, exploitation can be rapidly operationalized - meaning the timeline from vulnerability disclosure to ransomware deployment can shrink to days.

SmarterTools Breached by Own Product Flaw, Ransomware Groups Follow

Recent incidents demonstrate exactly how this pipeline plays out.

According to a SmarterTools report, SmarterTools was breached in January 2026 after attackers exploited an unpatched SmarterMail server running on an internal VM that was exposed inside their network.

The compromised environment included office and lab networks and a data-center segment connected through Active Directory, where attackers moved laterally and impacted around a dozen Windows servers.

The company shut down the affected infrastructure, restored systems from backup, rotated credentials, and removed some Windows/AD dependencies. Having said that, it was reported that core customer services and data were unaffected. Attackers gained an internal network foothold and attempted typical ransomware-style post-exploitation actions; it wasn't successful, thanks to network segmentation.

In another investigation published by Bleeping Computer, ransomware operators gained initial access through SmarterMail vulnerabilities and waited before triggering encryption payloads, a classic affiliate behavior pattern.

This pattern is important:

Initial access via email server vulnerability

Credential harvesting or token extraction

Lateral movement via Active Directory

Persistence via scheduled tasks or DFIR tool abuse

Ransomware deployment after staging period

Some campaigns have been linked to the Warlock ransomware group, with overlaps observed with nation-state-aligned activity clusters.

Detect Exploits Before Ransomware Groups Strike

Flare monitors underground forums and Telegram channels where threat actors share PoCs, exploits, and compromised credentials within hours of disclosure.

Get early warning when your infrastructure is discussed or targeted by ransomware operators.

Email Servers: Identity Infrastructure Attackers Target First

Email servers sit at a unique intersection of trust and visibility.

Domain authentication tokens

Password reset capabilities

External communication channels

Access to internal contact graphs

Integration with identity and directory services

Attackers understand that email ecosystems rely on multi-component authentication chains where a single weak link can break overall trust. Compromise the email infrastructure and you effectively compromise identity.

1,200+ Vulnerable Servers Identified on Shodan

We found ~34,000 servers on Shodan with indications of running SmarterMail. Out of the 34,000, there were 17,754 unique servers.

A further inspection of these servers shows that 1,185 are vulnerable to authentication bypass or RCE flaws. Other publications talk about ~6,000 vulnerable servers.

A geo-location analysis of these 1,185 servers shows US dominance:

A further analysis of the ISPs and Organizations shows a very diverse distribution of open SmarterMail servers, many self-hosted admin panels, shared hosting, VPS providers, and general-purpose cloud networks, typical of deployment by individuals rather than organizations.

This may indicate that after the strong security hype over the past weeks, organizations were quick to react and block this attack surface.

Underground Forums Share Exploits Within Days of Disclosure

The underground ecosystems are fast to react to such publications. The CVEs were published around the beginning of January, and on the same day, there were mentions and references to these vulnerabilities. To date, we’ve seen dozens of publications and references to these vulnerabilities.

This is normal underground behavior when it comes to critical vulnerabilities.

We have also seen some more malicious references. A few days after the first publication, there were references to Proof of Concept or exploit of the vulnerabilities. For instance, an Arabic-speaking Telegram channel shows PoC.

You can also see how the threat actor is showing proof of concept:

And another threat actor is showing a proof of concept to this vulnerability:

In a Spanish-speaking Telegram group, we saw references to an Offensive Security Tool:

On another Telegram group, we saw a data dump of admin credentials highlighted as it comes from a compromised SmarterMail server:

When accessing one of the links, you can indeed see a long list of admin credentials and the domains (or login) to which they belong.

CISA Confirms Active Exploitation in Ransomware Campaigns

These vulnerabilities were published in the beginning of 2026, CISA added CVE-2026-24423 to the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog in the beginning of February 2026, after confirming active ransomware exploitation.

This confirms that attackers are quick to exploit newly discovered critical RCE- related vulnerabilities:

Vulnerability disclosure

PoC written and released

Mass scanning operation

Weaponization: Data exfiltration, Ransomware etc.

Timeline shrinking from months/weeks to days.

How to Protect Email Infrastructure From Ransomware Access

Many organizations still treat email servers as “ONLY application infrastructure”. Well, they are not!

They are identity infrastructures that enable many follow-up attack vectors, as well as containing secrets and business logic. Defensive priorities should include:

Patch Urgency: Critical email server vulnerabilities should be treated like domain controller vulnerabilities.

Identity Telemetry: Organizations should monitor these environments for:
	Admin password resets
API calls to external hosts
Unexpected outbound HTTP from mail servers

Admin password resets

API calls to external hosts

Unexpected outbound HTTP from mail servers

Network Segmentation: Email infrastructure should never have unrestricted access to internal networks.

Threat Hunting Practice:
	API abuse patterns
Scheduled task persistence
Unexpected tooling like DFIR frameworks or remote admin tools

Scheduled task persistence

Unexpected tooling like DFIR frameworks or remote admin tools

Email Servers Are Identity Infrastructure—Secure Them Accordingly

The SmarterMail cases show once again how modern cybercrime operations are quick to add newly discovered initial access to their ongoing operation.

It also re-emphasizes the critical role email servers take in the modern organization:

Invaluable reconnaissance data for follow-up cybercrime

Organizations that continue treating them as just “messaging systems” will remain vulnerable to this new generation of intrusion pipelines.

[15] BleepingComputer - Microsoft: Anti-phishing rules mistakenly blocked emails, Teams messages
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Wed, 18 Feb 2026 11:26:53 -0500
Link: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-anti-phishing-rules-mistakenly-blocked-emails-teams-messages/

[TAM METİN - 553 kelime]
Microsoft says an Exchange Online issue that mistakenly quarantined legitimate emails last week was triggered by faulty heuristic detection rules designed to block credential phishing campaigns.

As Microsoft explains in a preliminary post-incident report published this week, a software error in its email security system incorrectly flagged thousands of legitimate URLs as phishing links for nearly a week, blocking users from opening emails and Teams messages.

The incident, tracked by Microsoft under EX1227432, began on February 5 and was not fully resolved until February 12. During that period, users across Exchange Online and Microsoft Teams were unable to open links in messages, with some of their emails quarantined entirely.

Administrators also received warnings that a "potentially malicious URL click was detected," alerts that Microsoft later confirmed were false positives.

The root cause was a logic error in a detection system designed to identify new credential phishing attacks. Shortly after the system was updated, it began flagging legitimate URLs at a far higher rate than intended, triggering a cascade of automated responses that aggravated the problem.

Other security tools within Microsoft's detection infrastructure also amplified the incident's impact, and a separate bug in the company's security signature systems further delayed efforts to roll back the flawed detection rules.

"This issue occurred due to a logic error in a heuristic detection aimed at novel credential phishing campaigns that spiked several hours after release," Microsoft explained.

"This spike in detection resulted in thousands of URL's being incorrectly identified as phishing, triggering blocks for newly delivered emails containing those URL's, ZAP events to remove email and Teams messages with those URL's in them, and also generating XDR alerts for click events related to these alerts."

Microsoft said that any user who received emails or Teams messages containing specific URLs may have been affected, but the company has yet to disclose the total number of impacted users. However, as BleepingComputer previously reported, Microsoft classified the issue as an "incident," which usually involves noticeable user impact.

While this preliminary report was published on Monday, Microsoft said that it will issue a final report within five business days of full resolution.

Microsoft has addressed other issues over the last several years that resulted in emails being quarantined or incorrectly tagged as spam or malicious. For instance, an Exchange Online bug caused a machine learning model to incorrectly flag emails from Gmail accounts as spam, while another one caused anti-spam systems to mistakenly quarantine some users' emails.

More recently, in September, an anti-spam service issue blocked Exchange Online and Microsoft Teams users from opening URLs and mistakenly quarantined some of their emails.

Microsoft is also working to fix a bug that allowed its AI-powered Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat to summarize confidential emails since late January.

[16] BleepingComputer - Data breach at fintech firm Figure affects nearly 1 million accounts
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[TAM METİN - 500 kelime]
Hackers have stolen the personal and contact information of nearly 1 million accounts after breaching the systems of Figure Technology Solutions, a self-described blockchain-native financial technology company.

Founded in 2018, Figure uses the Provenance blockchain for lending, borrowing, and securities trading, and has unlocked over $22 billion in home equity with over 250 partners, including banks, credit unions, fintechs, and home improvement companies.

While the blockchain lender didn't publicly disclose the incident, a Figure spokesperson told TechCrunch on Friday that the attackers stole "a limited number of files" in a social engineering attack.

BleepingComputer has also reached out to Figure with further questions about the breach, but a response was not immediately available.

Although the company has yet to share how many individuals were affected by the data breach, notification service Have I Been Pwned has now revealed the extent of the incident, reporting that data from 967,200 accounts was stolen in the attack.

"In February 2026, data obtained from the fintech lending platform Figure was publicly posted online," Have I Been Pwned said on Wednesday.

"The exposed data, dating back to January 2026, contained over 900k unique email addresses along with names, phone numbers, physical addresses and dates of birth. Figure confirmed the incident and attributed it to a social engineering attack in which an employee was tricked into providing access."

The ShinyHunters extortion group claimed responsibility for the breach and added the company to its dark web leak site, leaking 2.5GB of data allegedly stolen from thousands of loan applicants.

In recent weeks, ShinyHunters claimed similar breaches at Canada Goose, Panera Bread, Betterment, SoundCloud, PornHub, and CrowdStrike.

While not all of them are part of the same campaign, some of these victims were breached in a voice phishing (vishing) campaign targeting single sign-on (SSO) accounts at Okta, Microsoft, and Google across more than 100 high-profile organizations.

The attackers are impersonating IT support, calling their targets' employees and tricking them into entering credentials and multi-factor authentication (MFA) codes on phishing sites that impersonate their companies' login portals.

Once in, they gain access to the victim's SSO account, which provides them with access to other connected enterprise applications and services, including Salesforce, Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, SAP, Slack, Zendesk, Dropbox, Adobe, Atlassian, and many others.

As part of this campaign, ShinyHunters also breached online dating giant Match Group, which owns multiple popular dating services, including Tinder, Hinge, Meetic, Match.com, and OkCupid.

[17] BleepingComputer - Microsoft says bug causes Copilot to summarize confidential emails

[TAM METİN - 414 kelime]
Microsoft says a Microsoft 365 Copilot bug has been causing the AI assistant to summarize confidential emails since late January, bypassing data loss prevention (DLP) policies that organizations rely on to protect sensitive information.

According to a service alert seen by BleepingComputer, this bug (tracked under CW1226324 and first detected on January 21) affects the Copilot "work tab" chat feature, which incorrectly reads and summarizes emails stored in users' Sent Items and Drafts folders, including messages that carry confidentiality labels explicitly designed to restrict access by automated tools.

Copilot Chat (short for Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat) is the company's AI-powered, content-aware chat that lets users interact with AI agents. ​Microsoft began rolling out Copilot Chat to Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and OneNote for paying Microsoft 365 business customers in September 2025.

"Users' email messages with a confidential label applied are being incorrectly processed by Microsoft 365 Copilot chat," Microsoft said when it confirmed this issue.

"The Microsoft 365 Copilot 'work tab' Chat is summarizing email messages even though these email messages have a sensitivity label applied and a DLP policy is configured."

Microsoft has since confirmed that an unspecified code error is responsible and said it began rolling out a fix in early February. As of Wednesday, the company said it was continuing to monitor the deployment and is reaching out to a subset of affected users to verify that the fix is working.

"A code issue is allowing items in the sent items and draft folders to be picked up by Copilot even though confidential labels are set in place," Microsoft added.

Microsoft has not provided a final timeline for full remediation and has not disclosed how many users or organizations were affected, saying only that the scope of impact may change as the investigation continues.

However, this ongoing incident has been tagged as an advisory, a flag commonly used to describe service issues typically involving limited scope or impact.

[18] BleepingComputer - Glendale man gets 5 years in prison for role in darknet drug ring

[TAM METİN - 537 kelime]
​A Glendale man was sentenced to nearly five years in federal prison for his role in a darknet drug trafficking operation that sold cocaine, methamphetamine, MDMA, and ketamine to customers across the United States.

36-year-old Davit Avalyan received a 57-month sentence from U.S. District Judge Percy Anderson in Los Angeles after pleading guilty in October 2025 to one count of conspiracy to distribute narcotics.

Avalyan is the last of four defendants to be sentenced in the case. His accomplices, Hayk Grigoryan (also known as Hayk Greg), Gurgen Nersesyan (also known as Guro Tiko), and Hrant Gevorgyan, have already received prison sentences of 10 years, 43 months, and 24 months, respectively.

Prosecutors said Avalyan and his co-conspirators ran the operation from September 2018 to February 2025, maintaining a large network of darknet vendor accounts (including multiple storefronts with names like JoyInc, PlanetHollywood, and LaFarmacia) across multiple narcotics online marketplaces.

According to court documents, the group packaged drugs into parcels and mailed them from post offices and mailboxes throughout Los Angeles County and other locations.

JoyInc, one of the network's primary accounts, is believed to have launched as early as 2018 and is considered among the most prolific methamphetamine and cocaine distributors ever to operate on the darknet.

"Vendors JoyInc, LaFarmacia, WhiteDoc, JanesAddiction, DaShop, WhiteRepublic, Tomorowland, PlanetHollywood, DopeValley, and Major2Minor sold cocaine, methamphetamine, 3, 4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine ('MDMA'), and ketamine to drug customers on these darknet markets in exchange for cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin and Monero, and shipped the drugs throughout the United States via the United States Postal Service," the indictment reveals.

Their accounts were active "on several darknet marketplaces, including Dream Market, Wallstreet, Empire, Silk Road 3.1, ToRReZ, Dark0de, World Market, Tor2Door, alphabay, Incognito, ASAP, Ares, MGM Grand, Archetyp, Abacus, DrugHub, and DarkMatter and would sell methamphetamine, cocaine, MDMA, and ketamine to customers across the United States."

The FBI's JCODE (Joint Criminal Opioid Darknet Enforcement) team, a task force focused on dismantling criminal networks that use the darknet to traffic narcotics, led the investigation with support from the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the IRS Criminal Investigation, and the Los Angeles Police Department.

Earlier this month, a Taiwanese man was also sentenced to 30 years in prison for operating Incognito Market, a massive online narcotics marketplace linked to over $105 million in illegal drug sales.

In January, a Slovakian national pleaded guilty to helping operate a darknet marketplace that sold narcotics, cybercrime services, fake government IDs, and stolen personal information for more than two years, and a Virginia man who co-created the Empire Market dark web marketplace admitted to federal drug conspiracy charges for facilitating $430 million in illegal transactions.

[19] BleepingComputer - Spain orders NordVPN, ProtonVPN to block LaLiga piracy sites
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Tue, 17 Feb 2026 18:15:49 -0500
Link: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/legal/spain-orders-nordvpn-protonvpn-to-block-laliga-piracy-sites/

[TAM METİN - 654 kelime]
A Spanish court has granted precautionary measures against NordVPN and ProtonVPN, ordering the two popular VPN providers to block 16 websites that facilitate piracy of football matches.

The restrictions will apply to a dynamic list of IP addresses in Spain, and there will be no opportunity for appeals. The measures were taken 'inaudita parte', meaning that the defendants weren’t called to participate in a hearing.

LaLiga - the country’s professional football organizer, and its broadcasting partner, Telefónica, are required to “preserve sufficient digital evidence of the unlawful transmission of the protected contents.”

LaLiga showed a strong stance against the piracy ecosystem in recent years, previously targeting Cloudflare, accusing the internet giant of facilitating illegal sports streaming.

The two organizations proved that the VPN providers fall under the EU Digital Services Regulation, and therefore have a duty to help prevent copyright infringement carried out through their infrastructure.

“The orders identify how VPN systems prove to be a suitable means, 'highly effective and accessible to generate the possibility of access to content not accessible in certain geographic points,' distorting the real geographic location of online access, and facilitating 'access to websites that broadcast protected content illegally,'” reads LaLiga’s announcement.

“What is more, the orders highlight how the defendant companies acknowledge and even advertise that their system is excellent at evading restrictions.”

LaLiga characterized the ruling as unprecedented in Spain, aligning it with similar decisions in France, and celebrated that the liability of VPN providers for piracy is clearly recognized.

In response, ProtonVPN took to Twitter to question the decision, declaring a total lack of awareness of the proceedings and stating that they have not been formally notified.

“Any judicial order issued without proper notification to the affected parties, thereby denying them the opportunity to be heard, would be procedurally invalid under fundamental principles of due process, stated the VPN service provider.

“Spanish courts, like all courts operating under the rule of law, are bound by procedural safeguards that ensure parties are given a fair opportunity to present their case before any binding judgment is rendered.”

In a request for comments to BleepingComputer, NordVPN's spokesperson Laura Tyrylyte stated that the company was not involved in any legal proceedings in Spain.

"At this stage, we have not received the judicial documents mentioned in the press so it will be premature to comment without having reviewed them. We were not part of any Spanish judicial proceedings to our knowledge, and therefore had no opportunity to defend ourselves. Given such judgments impact on how the Internet operates, such an approach by rightsholders is unacceptable" - NordVPN

Tyrylyte stated that the process for blocking domains is ineffective in the fight against piracy as it does not address the root cause. Instead, hosting providers should be the target, since pirates can use subdomains to bypass the restrictions.

"Effective piracy control should focus on eliminating the source of the content, targeting hosting providers, cutting off financing for illegal operations, and increasing the availability of legitimate content."

Through its representative, NordVPN said that the measures affect mostly reputable, paid VPN providers, while free services continue to operate largely unhindered.

"Free VPNs are often harder to regulate and, since users who seek to avoid paying for content are unlikely to pay for a VPN either, these services remain a loophole for pirates to bypass restrictions."

[20] BleepingComputer - Flaws in popular VSCode extensions expose developers to attacks
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Tue, 17 Feb 2026 16:27:12 -0500
Link: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/flaws-in-popular-vscode-extensions-expose-developers-to-attacks/

[TAM METİN - 492 kelime]
Vulnerabilities with high to critical severity ratings affecting popular Visual Studio Code (VSCode) extensions collectively downloaded more than 128 million times could be exploited to steal local files and execute code remotely.

The security issues impact Code Runner (CVE-2025-65715), Markdown Preview Enhanced (CVE-2025-65716), Markdown Preview Enhanced (CVE-2025-65717), and Microsoft Live Preview (no identifier assigned).

Researchers at application security company Ox Security discovered the flaws and tried to disclose them since June 2025. However, the researchers say that no maintainer responded.

Remote code execution in IDE

VSCode extensions are add-ons that expand the functionality of Microsoft's integrated development environment (IDE). They can add language support, debugging tools, themes, and other functionality or customization options.

They run with significant access to the local development environment, including files, terminals, and network resources.

Ox Security published reports for each of the discovered flaws and warned that keeping the vulnerable extensions could expose the corporate environment to lateral movement, data exfiltration, and system takeover.

An attacker exploiting the CVE-2025-65717 critical vulnerability in the Live Server extension (over 72 million downloads on VSCode) can steal local files by directing the target to a malicious webpage.

The CVE-2025-65715 vulnerability in the Code Runner VSCode extension, with 37 million downloads, allows remote code execution by changing the extension's configuration file. This could be achieved through tricking the target into pasting or applying a maliciously configuration snippet in the global settings.json file.

Rated with a high-severity score of 8.8, CVE-2025-65716 affects the Markdown Preview Enhanced (8.5 million downloads) and can be leveraged to execute JavaScript via maliciously crafted Markdown file.

Ox Security researchers discovered a one-click XSS vulnerability in versions of Microsoft Live Preview before 0.4.16. It can be exploited to access sensitive files on a developer's machine. The extension has more than 11 million downloads on VSCode.

The flaws in the extensions also apply to Cursor and Windsurf, which are AI-powered VSCode-compatible alternative IDEs.

Ox Security's report highlights that the risks associated with a threat actor leveraging the issues include pivoting on the network and stealing sensitive details like API keys and configuration files.

Developers are advised to avoid running localhost servers unless necessary, opening untrusted HTML while they’re running, and applying untrusted configurations or pasting snippets into settings.json.

Also, it is advisable to remove unnecessary extensions and only install those from reputable publishers, while monitoring for unexpected setting changes.

[21] Krebs on Security - Kimwolf Botnet Swamps Anonymity Network I2P
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Wed, 11 Feb 2026 16:08:11 +0000
Link: https://krebsonsecurity.com/2026/02/kimwolf-botnet-swamps-anonymity-network-i2p/

[TAM METİN - 831 kelime]
For the past week, the massive “Internet of Things” (IoT) botnet known as Kimwolf has been disrupting The Invisible Internet Project (I2P), a decentralized, encrypted communications network designed to anonymize and secure online communications. I2P users started reporting disruptions in the network around the same time the Kimwolf botmasters began relying on it to evade takedown attempts against the botnet’s control servers.

Kimwolf is a botnet that surfaced in late 2025 and quickly infected millions of systems, turning poorly secured IoT devices like TV streaming boxes, digital picture frames and routers into relays for malicious traffic and abnormally large distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.

I2P is a decentralized, privacy-focused network that allows people to communicate and share information anonymously.

“It works by routing data through multiple encrypted layers across volunteer-operated nodes, hiding both the sender’s and receiver’s locations,” the I2P website explains. “The result is a secure, censorship-resistant network designed for private websites, messaging, and data sharing.”

On February 3, I2P users began complaining on the organization’s GitHub page about tens of thousands of routers suddenly overwhelming the network, preventing existing users from communicating with legitimate nodes. Users reported a rapidly increasing number of new routers joining the network that were unable to transmit data, and that the mass influx of new systems had overwhelmed the network to the point where users could no longer connect.

I2P users complaining about service disruptions from a rapidly increasing number of routers suddenly swamping the network.

When one I2P user asked whether the network was under attack, another user replied, “Looks like it. My physical router freezes when the number of connections exceeds 60,000.”

A graph shared by I2P developers showing a marked drop in successful connections on the I2P network around the time the Kimwolf botnet started trying to use the network for fallback communications.

The same day that I2P users began noticing the outages, the individuals in control of Kimwolf posted to their Discord channel that they had accidentally disrupted I2P after attempting to join 700,000 Kimwolf-infected bots as nodes on the network.

The Kimwolf botmaster openly discusses what they are doing with the botnet in a Discord channel with my name on it.

Although Kimwolf is known as a potent weapon for launching DDoS attacks, the outages caused this week by some portion of the botnet attempting to join I2P are what’s known as a “Sybil attack,” a threat in peer-to-peer networks where a single entity can disrupt the system by creating, controlling, and operating a large number of fake, pseudonymous identities.

Indeed, the number of Kimwolf-infected routers that tried to join I2P this past week was many times the network’s normal size. I2P’s Wikipedia page says the network consists of roughly 55,000 computers distributed throughout the world, with each participant acting as both a router (to relay traffic) and a client.

However, Lance James, founder of the New York City based cybersecurity consultancy Unit 221B and the original founder of I2P, told KrebsOnSecurity the entire I2P network now consists of between 15,000 and 20,000 devices on any given day.

An I2P user posted this graph on Feb. 10, showing tens of thousands of routers — mostly from the United States — suddenly attempting to join the network.

Benjamin Brundage is founder of Synthient, a startup that tracks proxy services and was the first to document Kimwolf’s unique spreading techniques. Brundage said the Kimwolf operator(s) have been trying to build a command and control network that can’t easily be taken down by security companies and network operators that are working together to combat the spread of the botnet.

Brundage said the people in control of Kimwolf have been experimenting with using I2P and a similar anonymity network — Tor — as a backup command and control network, although there have been no reports of widespread disruptions in the Tor network recently.

“I don’t think their goal is to take I2P down,” he said. “It’s more they’re looking for an alternative to keep the botnet stable in the face of takedown attempts.”

The Kimwolf botnet created challenges for Cloudflare late last year when it began instructing millions of infected devices to use Cloudflare’s domain name system (DNS) settings, causing control domains associated with Kimwolf to repeatedly usurp Amazon, Apple, Google and Microsoft in Cloudflare’s public ranking of the most frequently requested websites.

James said the I2P network is still operating at about half of its normal capacity, and that a new release is rolling out which should bring some stability improvements over the next week for users.

Meanwhile, Brundage said the good news is Kimwolf’s overlords appear to have quite recently alienated some of their more competent developers and operators, leading to a rookie mistake this past week that caused the botnet’s overall numbers to drop by more than 600,000 infected systems.

“It seems like they’re just testing stuff, like running experiments in production,” he said. “But the botnet’s numbers are dropping significantly now, and they don’t seem to know what they’re doing.”

Microsoft today released updates to fix more than 50 security holes in its Windows operating systems and other software, including patches for a whopping six “zero-day” vulnerabilities that attackers are already exploiting in the wild.

Zero-day #1 this month is CVE-2026-21510, a security feature bypass vulnerability in Windows Shell wherein a single click on a malicious link can quietly bypass Windows protections and run attacker-controlled content without warning or consent dialogs. CVE-2026-21510 affects all currently supported versions of Windows.

The zero-day flaw CVE-2026-21513 is a security bypass bug targeting MSHTML, the proprietary engine of the default Web browser in Windows. CVE-2026-21514 is a related security feature bypass in Microsoft Word.

The zero-day CVE-2026-21533 allows local attackers to elevate their user privileges to “SYSTEM” level access in Windows Remote Desktop Services. CVE-2026-21519 is a zero-day elevation of privilege flaw in the Desktop Window Manager (DWM), a key component of Windows that organizes windows on a user’s screen. Microsoft fixed a different zero-day in DWM just last month.

The sixth zero-day is CVE-2026-21525, a potentially disruptive denial-of-service vulnerability in the Windows Remote Access Connection Manager, the service responsible for maintaining VPN connections to corporate networks.

Chris Goettl at Ivanti reminds us Microsoft has issued several out-of-band security updates since January’s Patch Tuesday. On January 17, Microsoft pushed a fix that resolved a credential prompt failure when attempting remote desktop or remote application connections. On January 26, Microsoft patched a zero-day security feature bypass vulnerability (CVE-2026-21509) in Microsoft Office.

Kev Breen at Immersive notes that this month’s Patch Tuesday includes several fixes for remote code execution vulnerabilities affecting GitHub Copilot and multiple integrated development environments (IDEs), including VS Code, Visual Studio, and JetBrains products. The relevant CVEs are CVE-2026-21516, CVE-2026-21523, and CVE-2026-21256.

Breen said the AI vulnerabilities Microsoft patched this month stem from a command injection flaw that can be triggered through prompt injection, or tricking the AI agent into doing something it shouldn’t — like executing malicious code or commands.

“Developers are high-value targets for threat actors, as they often have access to sensitive data such as API keys and secrets that function as keys to critical infrastructure, including privileged AWS or Azure API keys,” Breen said. “When organizations enable developers and automation pipelines to use LLMs and agentic AI, a malicious prompt can have significant impact. This does not mean organizations should stop using AI. It does mean developers should understand the risks, teams should clearly identify which systems and workflows have access to AI agents, and least-privilege principles should be applied to limit the blast radius if developer secrets are compromised.”

The SANS Internet Storm Center has a clickable breakdown of each individual fix this month from Microsoft, indexed by severity and CVSS score. Enterprise Windows admins involved in testing patches before rolling them out should keep an eye on askwoody.com, which often has the skinny on wonky updates. Please don’t neglect to back up your data if it has been a while since you’ve done that, and feel free to sound off in the comments if you experience problems installing any of these fixes.

[23] Krebs on Security - Please Don’t Feed the Scattered Lapsus ShinyHunters

A prolific data ransom gang that calls itself Scattered Lapsus ShinyHunters (SLSH) has a distinctive playbook when it seeks to extort payment from victim firms: Harassing, threatening and even swatting executives and their families, all while notifying journalists and regulators about the extent of the intrusion. Some victims reportedly are paying — perhaps as much to contain the stolen data as to stop the escalating personal attacks. But a top SLSH expert warns that engaging at all beyond a “We’re not paying” response only encourages further harassment, noting that the group’s fractious and unreliable history means the only winning move is not to pay.

Unlike traditional, highly regimented Russia-based ransomware affiliate groups, SLSH is an unruly and somewhat fluid English-language extortion gang that appears uninterested in building a reputation of consistent behavior whereby victims might have some measure of confidence that the criminals will keep their word if paid.

That’s according to Allison Nixon, director of research at the New York City based security consultancy Unit 221B. Nixon has been closely tracking the criminal group and individual members as they bounce between various Telegram channels used to extort and harass victims, and she said SLSH differs from traditional data ransom groups in other important ways that argue against trusting them to do anything they say they’ll do — such as destroying stolen data.

Like SLSH, many traditional Russian ransomware groups have employed high-pressure tactics to force payment in exchange for a decryption key and/or a promise to delete stolen data, such as publishing a dark web shaming blog with samples of stolen data next to a countdown clock, or notifying journalists and board members of the victim company. But Nixon said the extortion from SLSH quickly escalates way beyond that — to threats of physical violence against executives and their families, DDoS attacks on the victim’s website, and repeated email-flooding campaigns.

SLSH is known for breaking into companies by phishing employees over the phone, and using the purloined access to steal sensitive internal data. In a January 30 blog post, Google’s security forensics firm Mandiant said SLSH’s most recent extortion attacks stem from incidents spanning early to mid-January 2026, when SLSH members pretended to be IT staff and called employees at targeted victim organizations claiming that the company was updating MFA settings.

“The threat actor directed the employees to victim-branded credential harvesting sites to capture their SSO credentials and MFA codes, and then registered their own device for MFA,” the blog post explained.

Victims often first learn of the breach when their brand name is uttered on whatever ephemeral new public Telegram group chat SLSH is using to threaten, extort and harass their prey. According to Nixon, the coordinated harassment on the SLSH Telegram channels is part of a well-orchestrated strategy to overwhelm the victim organization by manufacturing humiliation that pushes them over the threshold to pay.

Nixon said multiple executives at targeted organizations have been subject to “swatting” attacks, wherein SLSH communicated a phony bomb threat or hostage situation at the target’s address in the hopes of eliciting a heavily armed police response at their home or place of work.

“A big part of what they’re doing to victims is the psychological aspect of it, like harassing executives’ kids and threatening the board of the company,” Nixon told KrebsOnSecurity. “And while these victims are getting extortion demands, they’re simultaneously getting outreach from media outlets saying, ‘Hey, do you have any comments on the bad things we’re going to write about you.”

In a blog post today, Unit 221B argues that no one should negotiate with SLSH because the group has demonstrated a willingness to extort victims based on promises that it has no intention to keep. Nixon points out that all of SLSH’s known members hail from The Com, shorthand for a constellation of cybercrime-focused Discord and Telegram communities which serve as a kind of distributed social network that facilitates instant collaboration.

Nixon said Com-based extortion groups tend to instigate feuds and drama between group members, leading to lying, betrayals, credibility destroying behavior, backstabbing, and sabotaging each other.

“With this type of ongoing dysfunction, often compounding by substance abuse, these threat actors often aren’t able to act with the core goal in mind of completing a successful, strategic ransom operation,” Nixon wrote. “They continually lose control with outbursts that put their strategy and operational security at risk, which severely limits their ability to build a professional, scalable, and sophisticated criminal organization network for continued successful ransoms – unlike other, more tenured and professional criminal organizations focused on ransomware alone.”

Intrusions from established ransomware groups typically center around encryption/decryption malware that mostly stays on the affected machine. In contrast, Nixon said, ransom from a Com group is often structured the same as violent sextortion schemes against minors, wherein members of The Com will steal damaging information, threaten to release it, and “promise” to delete it if the victim complies without any guarantee or technical proof point that they will keep their word. She writes:

A key component of SLSH’s efforts to convince victims to pay, Nixon said, involves manipulating the media into hyping the threat posed by this group. This approach also borrows a page from the playbook of sextortion attacks, she said, which encourages predators to keep targets continuously engaged and worrying about the consequences of non-compliance.

“On days where SLSH had no substantial criminal ‘win’ to announce, they focused on announcing death threats and harassment to keep law enforcement, journalists, and cybercrime industry professionals focused on this group,” she said.

Nixon knows a thing or two about being threatened by SLSH: For the past several months, the group’s Telegram channels have been replete with threats of physical violence against her, against Yours Truly, and against other security researchers. These threats, she said, are just another way the group seeks to generate media attention and achieve a veneer of credibility, but they are useful as indicators of compromise because SLSH members tend to name drop and malign security researchers even in their communications with victims.

“Watch for the following behaviors in their communications to you or their public statements,” Unit 221B’s advisory reads. “Repeated abusive mentions of Allison Nixon (or “A.N”), Unit 221B, or cybersecurity journalists—especially Brian Krebs—or any other cybersecurity employee, or cybersecurity company. Any threats to kill, or commit terrorism, or violence against internal employees, cybersecurity employees, investigators, and journalists.”

Unit 221B says that while the pressure campaign during an extortion attempt may be traumatizing to employees, executives, and their family members, entering into drawn-out negotiations with SLSH incentivizes the group to increase the level of harm and risk, which could include the physical safety of employees and their families.

“The breached data will never go back to the way it was, but we can assure you that the harassment will end,” Nixon said. “So, your decision to pay should be a separate issue from the harassment. We believe that when you separate these issues, you will objectively see that the best course of action to protect your interests, in both the short and long term, is to refuse payment.”

[24] Krebs on Security - Who Operates the Badbox 2.0 Botnet?
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Mon, 26 Jan 2026 16:11:38 +0000

[TAM METİN - 1452 kelime]
The cybercriminals in control of Kimwolf — a disruptive botnet that has infected more than 2 million devices — recently shared a screenshot indicating they’d compromised the control panel for Badbox 2.0, a vast China-based botnet powered by malicious software that comes pre-installed on many Android TV streaming boxes. Both the FBI and Google say they are hunting for the people behind Badbox 2.0, and thanks to bragging by the Kimwolf botmasters we may now have a much clearer idea about that.

Our first story of 2026, The Kimwolf Botnet is Stalking Your Local Network, detailed the unique and highly invasive methods Kimwolf uses to spread. The story warned that the vast majority of Kimwolf infected systems were unofficial Android TV boxes that are typically marketed as a way to watch unlimited (pirated) movie and TV streaming services for a one-time fee.

Our January 8 story, Who Benefitted from the Aisuru and Kimwolf Botnets?, cited multiple sources saying the current administrators of Kimwolf went by the nicknames “Dort” and “Snow.” Earlier this month, a close former associate of Dort and Snow shared what they said was a screenshot the Kimwolf botmasters had taken while logged in to the Badbox 2.0 botnet control panel.

That screenshot, a portion of which is shown below, shows seven authorized users of the control panel, including one that doesn’t quite match the others: According to my source, the account “ABCD” (the one that is logged in and listed in the top right of the screenshot) belongs to Dort, who somehow figured out how to add their email address as a valid user of the Badbox 2.0 botnet.

The control panel for the Badbox 2.0 botnet lists seven authorized users and their email addresses. Click to enlarge.

Badbox has a storied history that well predates Kimwolf’s rise in October 2025. In July 2025, Google filed a “John Doe” lawsuit (PDF) against 25 unidentified defendants accused of operating Badbox 2.0, which Google described as a botnet of over ten million unsanctioned Android streaming devices engaged in advertising fraud. Google said Badbox 2.0, in addition to compromising multiple types of devices prior to purchase, also can infect devices by requiring the download of malicious apps from unofficial marketplaces.

Google’s lawsuit came on the heels of a June 2025 advisory from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), which warned that cyber criminals were gaining unauthorized access to home networks by either configuring the products with malware prior to the user’s purchase, or infecting the device as it downloads required applications that contain backdoors — usually during the set-up process.

The FBI said Badbox 2.0 was discovered after the original Badbox campaign was disrupted in 2024. The original Badbox was identified in 2023, and primarily consisted of Android operating system devices (TV boxes) that were compromised with backdoor malware prior to purchase.

KrebsOnSecurity was initially skeptical of the claim that the Kimwolf botmasters had hacked the Badbox 2.0 botnet. That is, until we began digging into the history of the qq.com email addresses in the screenshot above.

An online search for the address 34557257@qq.com (pictured in the screenshot above as the user “Chen“) shows it is listed as a point of contact for a number of China-based technology companies, including:

–Beijing Hong Dake Wang Science & Technology Co Ltd.
–Beijing Hengchuang Vision Mobile Media Technology Co. Ltd.
–Moxin Beijing Science and Technology Co. Ltd.

The website for Beijing Hong Dake Wang Science is asmeisvip[.]net, a domain that was flagged in a March 2025 report by HUMAN Security as one of several dozen sites tied to the distribution and management of the Badbox 2.0 botnet. Ditto for moyix[.]com, a domain associated with Beijing Hengchuang Vision Mobile.

A search at the breach tracking service Constella Intelligence finds 34557257@qq.com at one point used the password “cdh76111.” Pivoting on that password in Constella shows it is known to have been used by just two other email accounts: daihaic@gmail.com and cathead@gmail.com.

Constella found cathead@gmail.com registered an account at jd.com (China’s largest online retailer) in 2021 under the name “陈代海,” which translates to “Chen Daihai.” According to DomainTools.com, the name Chen Daihai is present in the original registration records (2008) for moyix[.]com, along with the email address cathead@astrolink[.]cn.

Incidentally, astrolink[.]cn also is among the Badbox 2.0 domains identified in HUMAN Security’s 2025 report. DomainTools finds cathead@astrolink[.]cn was used to register more than a dozen domains, including vmud[.]net, yet another Badbox 2.0 domain tagged by HUMAN Security.

A cached copy of astrolink[.]cn preserved at archive.org shows the website belongs to a mobile app development company whose full name is Beijing Astrolink Wireless Digital Technology Co. Ltd. The archived website reveals a “Contact Us” page that lists a Chen Daihai as part of the company’s technology department. The other person featured on that contact page is Zhu Zhiyu, and their email address is listed as xavier@astrolink[.]cn.

A Google-translated version of Astrolink’s website, circa 2009. Image: archive.org.

Astute readers will notice that the user Mr.Zhu in the Badbox 2.0 panel used the email address xavierzhu@qq.com. Searching this address in Constella reveals a jd.com account registered in the name of Zhu Zhiyu. A rather unique password used by this account matches the password used by the address xavierzhu@gmail.com, which DomainTools finds was the original registrant of astrolink[.]cn.

The very first account listed in the Badbox 2.0 panel — “admin,” registered in November 2020 — used the email address 189308024@qq.com. DomainTools shows this email is found in the 2022 registration records for the domain guilincloud[.]cn, which includes the registrant name “Huang Guilin.”

Constella finds 189308024@qq.com is associated with the China phone number 18681627767. The open-source intelligence platform osint.industries reveals this phone number is connected to a Microsoft profile created in 2014 under the name Guilin Huang (桂林 黄). The cyber intelligence platform Spycloud says that phone number was used in 2017 to create an account at the Chinese social media platform Weibo under the username “h_guilin.”

The public information attached to Guilin Huang’s Microsoft account, according to the breach tracking service osintindustries.com.

The remaining three users and corresponding qq.com email addresses were all connected to individuals in China. However, none of them (nor Mr. Huang) had any apparent connection to the entities created and operated by Chen Daihai and Zhu Zhiyu — or to any corporate entities for that matter. Also, none of these individuals responded to requests for comment.

The mind map below includes search pivots on the email addresses, company names and phone numbers that suggest a connection between Chen Daihai, Zhu Zhiyu, and Badbox 2.0.

This mind map includes search pivots on the email addresses, company names and phone numbers that appear to connect Chen Daihai and Zhu Zhiyu to Badbox 2.0. Click to enlarge.

The idea that the Kimwolf botmasters could have direct access to the Badbox 2.0 botnet is a big deal, but explaining exactly why that is requires some background on how Kimwolf spreads to new devices. The botmasters figured out they could trick residential proxy services into relaying malicious commands to vulnerable devices behind the firewall on the unsuspecting user’s local network.

The vulnerable systems sought out by Kimwolf are primarily Internet of Things (IoT) devices like unsanctioned Android TV boxes and digital photo frames that have no discernible security or authentication built-in. Put simply, if you can communicate with these devices, you can compromise them with a single command.

Our January 2 story featured research from the proxy-tracking firm Synthient, which alerted 11 different residential proxy providers that their proxy endpoints were vulnerable to being abused for this kind of local network probing and exploitation.

Most of those vulnerable proxy providers have since taken steps to prevent customers from going upstream into the local networks of residential proxy endpoints, and it appeared that Kimwolf would no longer be able to quickly spread to millions of devices simply by exploiting some residential proxy provider.

However, the source of that Badbox 2.0 screenshot said the Kimwolf botmasters had an ace up their sleeve the whole time: Secret access to the Badbox 2.0 botnet control panel.

“Dort has gotten unauthorized access,” the source said. “So, what happened is normal proxy providers patched this. But Badbox doesn’t sell proxies by itself, so it’s not patched. And as long as Dort has access to Badbox, they would be able to load” the Kimwolf malware directly onto TV boxes associated with Badbox 2.0.

The source said it isn’t clear how Dort gained access to the Badbox botnet panel. But it’s unlikely that Dort’s existing account will persist for much longer: All of our notifications to the qq.com email addresses listed in the control panel screenshot received a copy of that image, as well as questions about the apparently rogue ABCD account.

[25] Krebs on Security - Kimwolf Botnet Lurking in Corporate, Govt. Networks
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[TAM METİN - 992 kelime]
A new Internet-of-Things (IoT) botnet called Kimwolf has spread to more than 2 million devices, forcing infected systems to participate in massive distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and to relay other malicious and abusive Internet traffic. Kimwolf’s ability to scan the local networks of compromised systems for other IoT devices to infect makes it a sobering threat to organizations, and new research reveals Kimwolf is surprisingly prevalent in government and corporate networks.

Image: Shutterstock, @Elzicon.

Kimwolf grew rapidly in the waning months of 2025 by tricking various “residential proxy” services into relaying malicious commands to devices on the local networks of those proxy endpoints. Residential proxies are sold as a way to anonymize and localize one’s Web traffic to a specific region, and the biggest of these services allow customers to route their Internet activity through devices in virtually any country or city around the globe.

The malware that turns one’s Internet connection into a proxy node is often quietly bundled with various mobile apps and games, and it typically forces the infected device to relay malicious and abusive traffic — including ad fraud, account takeover attempts, and mass content-scraping.

Kimwolf mainly targeted proxies from IPIDEA, a Chinese service that has millions of proxy endpoints for rent on any given week. The Kimwolf operators discovered they could forward malicious commands to the internal networks of IPIDEA proxy endpoints, and then programmatically scan for and infect other vulnerable devices on each endpoint’s local network.

Most of the systems compromised through Kimwolf’s local network scanning have been unofficial Android TV streaming boxes. These are typically Android Open Source Project devices — not Android TV OS devices or Play Protect certified Android devices — and they are generally marketed as a way to watch unlimited (read:pirated) video content from popular subscription streaming services for a one-time fee.

However, a great many of these TV boxes ship to consumers with residential proxy software pre-installed. What’s more, they have no real security or authentication built-in: If you can communicate directly with the TV box, you can also easily compromise it with malware.

While IPIDEA and other affected proxy providers recently have taken steps to block threats like Kimwolf from going upstream into their endpoints (reportedly with varying degrees of success), the Kimwolf malware remains on millions of infected devices.

A screenshot of IPIDEA’s proxy service.

Kimwolf’s close association with residential proxy networks and compromised Android TV boxes might suggest we’d find relatively few infections on corporate networks. However, the security firm Infoblox said a recent review of its customer traffic found nearly 25 percent of them made a query to a Kimwolf-related domain name since October 1, 2025, when the botnet first showed signs of life.

Infoblox found the affected customers are based all over the world and in a wide range of industry verticals, from education and healthcare to government and finance.

“To be clear, this suggests that nearly 25% of customers had at least one device that was an endpoint in a residential proxy service targeted by Kimwolf operators,” Infoblox explained. “Such a device, maybe a phone or a laptop, was essentially co-opted by the threat actor to probe the local network for vulnerable devices. A query means a scan was made, not that new devices were compromised. Lateral movement would fail if there were no vulnerable devices to be found or if the DNS resolution was blocked.”

Synthient, a startup that tracks proxy services and was the first to disclose on January 2 the unique methods Kimwolf uses to spread, found proxy endpoints from IPIDEA were present in alarming numbers at government and academic institutions worldwide. Synthient said it spied at least 33,000 affected Internet addresses at universities and colleges, and nearly 8,000 IPIDEA proxies within various U.S. and foreign government networks.

The top 50 domain names sought out by users of IPIDEA’s residential proxy service, according to Synthient.

In a webinar on January 16, experts at the proxy tracking service Spur profiled Internet addresses associated with IPIDEA and 10 other proxy services that were thought to be vulnerable to Kimwolf’s tricks. Spur found residential proxies in nearly 300 government owned and operated networks, 318 utility companies, 166 healthcare companies or hospitals, and 141 companies in banking and finance.

“I looked at the 298 [government] owned and operated [networks], and so many of them were DoD [U.S. Department of Defense], which is kind of terrifying that DoD has IPIDEA and these other proxy services located inside of it,” Spur Co-Founder Riley Kilmer said. “I don’t know how these enterprises have these networks set up. It could be that [infected devices] are segregated on the network, that even if you had local access it doesn’t really mean much. However, it’s something to be aware of. If a device goes in, anything that device has access to the proxy would have access to.”

Kilmer said Kimwolf demonstrates how a single residential proxy infection can quickly lead to bigger problems for organizations that are harboring unsecured devices behind their firewalls, noting that proxy services present a potentially simple way for attackers to probe other devices on the local network of a targeted organization.

“If you know you have [proxy] infections that are located in a company, you can chose that [network] to come out of and then locally pivot,” Kilmer said. “If you have an idea of where to start or look, now you have a foothold in a company or an enterprise based on just that.”

This is the third story in our series on the Kimwolf botnet. Next week, we’ll shed light on the myriad China-based individuals and companies connected to the Badbox 2.0 botnet, the collective name given to a vast number of Android TV streaming box models that ship with no discernible security or authentication built-in, and with residential proxy malware pre-installed.

[26] Krebs on Security - Patch Tuesday, January 2026 Edition
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Wed, 14 Jan 2026 00:47:38 +0000
Link: https://krebsonsecurity.com/2026/01/patch-tuesday-january-2026-edition/

[TAM METİN - 910 kelime]
Microsoft today issued patches to plug at least 113 security holes in its various Windows operating systems and supported software. Eight of the vulnerabilities earned Microsoft’s most-dire “critical” rating, and the company warns that attackers are already exploiting one of the bugs fixed today.

January’s Microsoft zero-day flaw — CVE-2026-20805 — is brought to us by a flaw in the Desktop Window Manager (DWM), a key component of Windows that organizes windows on a user’s screen. Kev Breen, senior director of cyber threat research at Immersive, said despite awarding CVE-2026-20805 a middling CVSS score of 5.5, Microsoft has confirmed its active exploitation in the wild, indicating that threat actors are already leveraging this flaw against organizations.

Breen said vulnerabilities of this kind are commonly used to undermine Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR), a core operating system security control designed to protect against buffer overflows and other memory-manipulation exploits.

“By revealing where code resides in memory, this vulnerability can be chained with a separate code execution flaw, transforming a complex and unreliable exploit into a practical and repeatable attack,” Breen said. “Microsoft has not disclosed which additional components may be involved in such an exploit chain, significantly limiting defenders’ ability to proactively threat hunt for related activity. As a result, rapid patching currently remains the only effective mitigation.”

Chris Goettl, vice president of product management at Ivanti, observed that CVE-2026-20805 affects all currently supported and extended security update supported versions of the Windows OS. Goettl said it would be a mistake to dismiss the severity of this flaw based on its “Important” rating and relatively low CVSS score.

“A risk-based prioritization methodology warrants treating this vulnerability as a higher severity than the vendor rating or CVSS score assigned,” he said.

Among the critical flaws patched this month are two Microsoft Office remote code execution bugs (CVE-2026-20952 and CVE-2026-20953) that can be triggered just by viewing a booby-trapped message in the Preview Pane.

Our October 2025 Patch Tuesday “End of 10” roundup noted that Microsoft had removed a modem driver from all versions after it was discovered that hackers were abusing a vulnerability in it to hack into systems. Adam Barnett at Rapid7 said Microsoft today removed another couple of modem drivers from Windows for a broadly similar reason: Microsoft is aware of functional exploit code for an elevation of privilege vulnerability in a very similar modem driver, tracked as CVE-2023-31096.

“That’s not a typo; this vulnerability was originally published via MITRE over two years ago, along with a credible public writeup by the original researcher,” Barnett said. “Today’s Windows patches remove agrsm64.sys and agrsm.sys. All three modem drivers were originally developed by the same now-defunct third party, and have been included in Windows for decades. These driver removals will pass unnoticed for most people, but you might find active modems still in a few contexts, including some industrial control systems.”

According to Barnett, two questions remain: How many more legacy modem drivers are still present on a fully-patched Windows asset; and how many more elevation-to-SYSTEM vulnerabilities will emerge from them before Microsoft cuts off attackers who have been enjoying “living off the land[line] by exploiting an entire class of dusty old device drivers?”

“Although Microsoft doesn’t claim evidence of exploitation for CVE-2023-31096, the relevant 2023 write-up and the 2025 removal of the other Agere modem driver have provided two strong signals for anyone looking for Windows exploits in the meantime,” Barnett said. “In case you were wondering, there is no need to have a modem connected; the mere presence of the driver is enough to render an asset vulnerable.”

Immersive, Ivanti and Rapid7 all called attention to CVE-2026-21265, which is a critical Security Feature Bypass vulnerability affecting Windows Secure Boot. This security feature is designed to protect against threats like rootkits and bootkits, and it relies on a set of certificates that are set to expire in June 2026 and October 2026. Once these 2011 certificates expire, Windows devices that do not have the new 2023 certificates can no longer receive Secure Boot security fixes.

Barnett cautioned that when updating the bootloader and BIOS, it is essential to prepare fully ahead of time for the specific OS and BIOS combination you’re working with, since incorrect remediation steps can lead to an unbootable system.

“Fifteen years is a very long time indeed in information security, but the clock is running out on the Microsoft root certificates which have been signing essentially everything in the Secure Boot ecosystem since the days of Stuxnet,” Barnett said. “Microsoft issued replacement certificates back in 2023, alongside CVE-2023-24932 which covered relevant Windows patches as well as subsequent steps to remediate the Secure Boot bypass exploited by the BlackLotus bootkit.”

Goettl noted that Mozilla has released updates for Firefox and Firefox ESR resolving a total of 34 vulnerabilities, two of which are suspected to be exploited (CVE-2026-0891 and CVE-2026-0892). Both are resolved in Firefox 147 (MFSA2026-01) and CVE-2026-0891 is resolved in Firefox ESR 140.7 (MFSA2026-03).

“Expect Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge updates this week in addition to a high severity vulnerability in Chrome WebView that was resolved in the January 6 Chrome update (CVE-2026-0628),” Goettl said.

As ever, the SANS Internet Storm Center has a per-patch breakdown by severity and urgency. Windows admins should keep an eye on askwoody.com for any news about patches that don’t quite play nice with everything. If you experience any issues related installing January’s patches, please drop a line in the comments below.

Our first story of 2026 revealed how a destructive new botnet called Kimwolf has infected more than two million devices by mass-compromising a vast number of unofficial Android TV streaming boxes. Today, we’ll dig through digital clues left behind by the hackers, network operators and services that appear to have benefitted from Kimwolf’s spread.

On Dec. 17, 2025, the Chinese security firm XLab published a deep dive on Kimwolf, which forces infected devices to participate in distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and to relay abusive and malicious Internet traffic for so-called “residential proxy” services.

The software that turns one’s device into a residential proxy is often quietly bundled with mobile apps and games. Kimwolf specifically targeted residential proxy software that is factory installed on more than a thousand different models of unsanctioned Android TV streaming devices. Very quickly, the residential proxy’s Internet address starts funneling traffic that is linked to ad fraud, account takeover attempts and mass content scraping.

The XLab report explained its researchers found “definitive evidence” that the same cybercriminal actors and infrastructure were used to deploy both Kimwolf and the Aisuru botnet — an earlier version of Kimwolf that also enslaved devices for use in DDoS attacks and proxy services.

XLab said it suspected since October that Kimwolf and Aisuru had the same author(s) and operators, based in part on shared code changes over time. But it said those suspicions were confirmed on December 8 when it witnessed both botnet strains being distributed by the same Internet address at 93.95.112[.]59.

Public records show the Internet address range flagged by XLab is assigned to Lehi, Utah-based Resi Rack LLC. Resi Rack’s website bills the company as a “Premium Game Server Hosting Provider.” Meanwhile, Resi Rack’s ads on the Internet moneymaking forum BlackHatWorld refer to it as a “Premium Residential Proxy Hosting and Proxy Software Solutions Company.”

Resi Rack co-founder Cassidy Hales told KrebsOnSecurity his company received a notification on December 10 about Kimwolf using their network “that detailed what was being done by one of our customers leasing our servers.”

“When we received this email we took care of this issue immediately,” Hales wrote in response to an email requesting comment. “This is something we are very disappointed is now associated with our name and this was not the intention of our company whatsoever.”

The Resi Rack Internet address cited by XLab on December 8 came onto KrebsOnSecurity’s radar more than two weeks before that. Benjamin Brundage is founder of Synthient, a startup that tracks proxy services. In late October 2025, Brundage shared that the people selling various proxy services which benefitted from the Aisuru and Kimwolf botnets were doing so at a new Discord server called resi[.]to.

On November 24, 2025, a member of the resi-dot-to Discord channel shares an IP address responsible for proxying traffic over Android TV streaming boxes infected by the Kimwolf botnet.

When KrebsOnSecurity joined the resi[.]to Discord channel in late October as a silent lurker, the server had fewer than 150 members, including “Shox” — the nickname used by Resi Rack’s co-founder Mr. Hales — and his business partner “Linus,” who did not respond to requests for comment.

Other members of the resi[.]to Discord channel would periodically post new IP addresses that were responsible for proxying traffic over the Kimwolf botnet. As the screenshot from resi[.]to above shows, that Resi Rack Internet address flagged by XLab was used by Kimwolf to direct proxy traffic as far back as November 24, if not earlier. All told, Synthient said it tracked at least seven static Resi Rack IP addresses connected to Kimwolf proxy infrastructure between October and December 2025.

Neither of Resi Rack’s co-owners responded to follow-up questions. Both have been active in selling proxy services via Discord for nearly two years. According to a review of Discord messages indexed by the cyber intelligence firm Flashpoint, Shox and Linus spent much of 2024 selling static “ISP proxies” by routing various Internet address blocks at major U.S. Internet service providers.

In February 2025, AT&T announced that effective July 31, 2025, it would no longer originate routes for network blocks that are not owned and managed by AT&T (other major ISPs have since made similar moves). Less than a month later, Shox and Linus told customers they would soon cease offering static ISP proxies as a result of these policy changes.

The stated owner of the resi[.]to Discord server went by the abbreviated username “D.” That initial appears to be short for the hacker handle “Dort,” a name that was invoked frequently throughout these Discord chats.

This “Dort” nickname came up in KrebsOnSecurity’s recent conversations with “Forky,” a Brazilian man who acknowledged being involved in the marketing of the Aisuru botnet at its inception in late 2024. But Forky vehemently denied having anything to do with a series of massive and record-smashing DDoS attacks in the latter half of 2025 that were blamed on Aisuru, saying the botnet by that point had been taken over by rivals.

Forky asserts that Dort is a resident of Canada and one of at least two individuals currently in control of the Aisuru/Kimwolf botnet. The other individual Forky named as an Aisuru/Kimwolf botmaster goes by the nickname “Snow.”

On January 2 — just hours after our story on Kimwolf was published — the historical chat records on resi[.]to were erased without warning and replaced by a profanity-laced message for Synthient’s founder. Minutes after that, the entire server disappeared.

Later that same day, several of the more active members of the now-defunct resi[.]to Discord server moved to a Telegram channel where they posted Brundage’s personal information, and generally complained about being unable to find reliable “bulletproof” hosting for their botnet.

Hilariously, a user by the name “Richard Remington” briefly appeared in the group’s Telegram server to post a crude “Happy New Year” sketch that claims Dort and Snow are now in control of 3.5 million devices infected by Aisuru and/or Kimwolf. Richard Remington’s Telegram account has since been deleted, but it previously stated its owner operates a website that caters to DDoS-for-hire or “stresser” services seeking to test their firepower.

BYTECONNECT, PLAINPROXIES, AND 3XK TECH

Reports from both Synthient and XLab found that Kimwolf was used to deploy programs that turned infected systems into Internet traffic relays for multiple residential proxy services. Among those was a component that installed a software development kit (SDK) called ByteConnect, which is distributed by a provider known as Plainproxies.

ByteConnect says it specializes in “monetizing apps ethically and free,” while Plainproxies advertises the ability to provide content scraping companies with “unlimited” proxy pools. However, Synthient said that upon connecting to ByteConnect’s SDK they instead observed a mass influx of credential-stuffing attacks targeting email servers and popular online websites.

A search on LinkedIn finds the CEO of Plainproxies is Friedrich Kraft, whose resume says he is co-founder of ByteConnect Ltd. Public Internet routing records show Mr. Kraft also operates a hosting firm in Germany called 3XK Tech GmbH. Mr. Kraft did not respond to repeated requests for an interview.

In July 2025, Cloudflare reported that 3XK Tech (a.k.a. Drei-K-Tech) had become the Internet’s largest source of application-layer DDoS attacks. In November 2025, the security firm GreyNoise Intelligence found that Internet addresses on 3XK Tech were responsible for roughly three-quarters of the Internet scanning being done at the time for a newly discovered and critical vulnerability in security products made by Palo Alto Networks.

LinkedIn has a profile for another Plainproxies employee, Julia Levi, who is listed as co-founder of ByteConnect. Ms. Levi did not respond to requests for comment. Her resume says she previously worked for two major proxy providers: Netnut Proxy Network, and Bright Data.

Synthient likewise said Plainproxies ignored their outreach, noting that the Byteconnect SDK continues to remain active on devices compromised by Kimwolf.

Synthient’s January 2 report said another proxy provider heavily involved in the sale of Kimwolf proxies was Maskify, which currently advertises on multiple cybercrime forums that it has more than six million residential Internet addresses for rent.

Maskify prices its service at a rate of 30 cents per gigabyte of data relayed through their proxies. According to Synthient, that price range is insanely low and is far cheaper than any other proxy provider in business today.

“Synthient’s Research Team received screenshots from other proxy providers showing key Kimwolf actors attempting to offload proxy bandwidth in exchange for upfront cash,” the Synthient report noted. “This approach likely helped fuel early development, with associated members spending earnings on infrastructure and outsourced development tasks. Please note that resellers know precisely what they are selling; proxies at these prices are not ethically sourced.”

Hours after our first Kimwolf story was published last week, the resi[.]to Discord server vanished, Synthient’s website was hit with a DDoS attack, and the Kimwolf botmasters took to doxing Brundage via their botnet.

The harassing messages appeared as text records uploaded to the Ethereum Name Service (ENS), a distributed system for supporting smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. As documented by XLab, in mid-December the Kimwolf operators upgraded their infrastructure and began using ENS to better withstand the near-constant takedown efforts targeting the botnet’s control servers.

By telling infected systems to seek out the Kimwolf control servers via ENS, even if the servers that the botmasters use to control the botnet are taken down the attacker only needs to update the ENS text record to reflect the new Internet address of the control server, and the infected devices will immediately know where to look for further instructions.

“This channel itself relies on the decentralized nature of blockchain, unregulated by Ethereum or other blockchain operators, and cannot be blocked,” XLab wrote.

The text records included in Kimwolf’s ENS instructions can also feature short messages, such as those that carried Brundage’s personal information. Other ENS text records associated with Kimwolf offered some sage advice: “If flagged, we encourage the TV box to be destroyed.”

An ENS record tied to the Kimwolf botnet advises, “If flagged, we encourage the TV box to be destroyed.”

Both Synthient and XLabs say Kimwolf targets a vast number of Android TV streaming box models, all of which have zero security protections, and many of which ship with proxy malware built in. Generally speaking, if you can send a data packet to one of these devices you can also seize administrative control over it.

If you own a TV box that matches one of these model names and/or numbers, please just rip it out of your network. If you encounter one of these devices on the network of a family member or friend, send them a link to this story (or to our January 2 story on Kimwolf) and explain that it’s not worth the potential hassle and harm created by keeping them plugged in.

[28] Krebs on Security - The Kimwolf Botnet is Stalking Your Local Network
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[TAM METİN - 4399 kelime]
The story you are reading is a series of scoops nestled inside a far more urgent Internet-wide security advisory. The vulnerability at issue has been exploited for months already, and it’s time for a broader awareness of the threat. The short version is that everything you thought you knew about the security of the internal network behind your Internet router probably is now dangerously out of date.

The security company Synthient currently sees more than 2 million infected Kimwolf devices distributed globally but with concentrations in Vietnam, Brazil, India, Saudi Arabia, Russia and the United States. Synthient found that two-thirds of the Kimwolf infections are Android TV boxes with no security or authentication built in.

The past few months have witnessed the explosive growth of a new botnet dubbed Kimwolf, which experts say has infected more than 2 million devices globally. The Kimwolf malware forces compromised systems to relay malicious and abusive Internet traffic — such as ad fraud, account takeover attempts and mass content scraping — and participate in crippling distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks capable of knocking nearly any website offline for days at a time.

More important than Kimwolf’s staggering size, however, is the diabolical method it uses to spread so quickly: By effectively tunneling back through various “residential proxy” networks and into the local networks of the proxy endpoints, and by further infecting devices that are hidden behind the assumed protection of the user’s firewall and Internet router.

Residential proxy networks are sold as a way for customers to anonymize and localize their Web traffic to a specific region, and the biggest of these services allow customers to route their traffic through devices in virtually any country or city around the globe.

The malware that turns an end-user’s Internet connection into a proxy node is often bundled with dodgy mobile apps and games. These residential proxy programs also are commonly installed via unofficial Android TV boxes sold by third-party merchants on popular e-commerce sites like Amazon, BestBuy, Newegg, and Walmart.

These TV boxes range in price from $40 to $400, are marketed under a dizzying range of no-name brands and model numbers, and frequently are advertised as a way to stream certain types of subscription video content for free. But there’s a hidden cost to this transaction: As we’ll explore in a moment, these TV boxes make up a considerable chunk of the estimated two million systems currently infected with Kimwolf.

Kimwolf also is quite good at infecting a range of Internet-connected digital photo frames that likewise are abundant at major e-commerce websites. In November 2025, researchers from Quokka published a report (PDF) detailing serious security issues in Android-based digital picture frames running the Uhale app — including Amazon’s bestselling digital frame as of March 2025.

There are two major security problems with these photo frames and unofficial Android TV boxes. The first is that a considerable percentage of them come with malware pre-installed, or else require the user to download an unofficial Android App Store and malware in order to use the device for its stated purpose (video content piracy). The most typical of these uninvited guests are small programs that turn the device into a residential proxy node that is resold to others.

The second big security nightmare with these photo frames and unsanctioned Android TV boxes is that they rely on a handful of Internet-connected microcomputer boards that have no discernible security or authentication requirements built-in. In other words, if you are on the same network as one or more of these devices, you can likely compromise them simultaneously by issuing a single command across the network.

THERE’S NO PLACE LIKE 127.0.0.1

The combination of these two security realities came to the fore in October 2025, when an undergraduate computer science student at the Rochester Institute of Technology began closely tracking Kimwolf’s growth, and interacting directly with its apparent creators on a daily basis.

Benjamin Brundage is the 22-year-old founder of the security firm Synthient, a startup that helps companies detect proxy networks and learn how those networks are being abused. Conducting much of his research into Kimwolf while studying for final exams, Brundage told KrebsOnSecurity in late October 2025 he suspected Kimwolf was a new Android-based variant of Aisuru, a botnet that was incorrectly blamed for a number of record-smashing DDoS attacks last fall.

Brundage says Kimwolf grew rapidly by abusing a glaring vulnerability in many of the world’s largest residential proxy services. The crux of the weakness, he explained, was that these proxy services weren’t doing enough to prevent their customers from forwarding requests to internal servers of the individual proxy endpoints.

Most proxy services take basic steps to prevent their paying customers from “going upstream” into the local network of proxy endpoints, by explicitly denying requests for local addresses specified in RFC-1918, including the well-known Network Address Translation (NAT) ranges 10.0.0.0/8, 192.168.0.0/16, and 172.16.0.0/12. These ranges allow multiple devices in a private network to access the Internet using a single public IP address, and if you run any kind of home or office network, your internal address space operates within one or more of these NAT ranges.

However, Brundage discovered that the people operating Kimwolf had figured out how to talk directly to devices on the internal networks of millions of residential proxy endpoints, simply by changing their Domain Name System (DNS) settings to match those in the RFC-1918 address ranges.

“It is possible to circumvent existing domain restrictions by using DNS records that point to 192.168.0.1 or 0.0.0.0,” Brundage wrote in a first-of-its-kind security advisory sent to nearly a dozen residential proxy providers in mid-December 2025. “This grants an attacker the ability to send carefully crafted requests to the current device or a device on the local network. This is actively being exploited, with attackers leveraging this functionality to drop malware.”

As with the digital photo frames mentioned above, many of these residential proxy services run solely on mobile devices that are running some game, VPN or other app with a hidden component that turns the user’s mobile phone into a residential proxy — often without any meaningful consent.

In a report published today, Synthient said key actors involved in Kimwolf were observed monetizing the botnet through app installs, selling residential proxy bandwidth, and selling its DDoS functionality.

“Synthient expects to observe a growing interest among threat actors in gaining unrestricted access to proxy networks to infect devices, obtain network access, or access sensitive information,” the report observed. “Kimwolf highlights the risks posed by unsecured proxy networks and their viability as an attack vector.”

After purchasing a number of unofficial Android TV box models that were most heavily represented in the Kimwolf botnet, Brundage further discovered the proxy service vulnerability was only part of the reason for Kimwolf’s rapid rise: He also found virtually all of the devices he tested were shipped from the factory with a powerful feature called Android Debug Bridge (ADB) mode enabled by default.

Many of the unofficial Android TV boxes infected by Kimwolf include the ominous disclaimer: “Made in China. Overseas use only.” Image: Synthient.

ADB is a diagnostic tool intended for use solely during the manufacturing and testing processes, because it allows the devices to be remotely configured and even updated with new (and potentially malicious) firmware. However, shipping these devices with ADB turned on creates a security nightmare because in this state they constantly listen for and accept unauthenticated connection requests.

For example, opening a command prompt and typing “adb connect” along with a vulnerable device’s (local) IP address followed immediately by “:5555” will very quickly offer unrestricted “super user” administrative access.

Brundage said by early December, he’d identified a one-to-one overlap between new Kimwolf infections and proxy IP addresses offered for rent by China-based IPIDEA, currently the world’s largest residential proxy network by all accounts.

“Kimwolf has almost doubled in size this past week, just by exploiting IPIDEA’s proxy pool,” Brundage told KrebsOnSecurity in early December as he was preparing to notify IPIDEA and 10 other proxy providers about his research.

Brundage said Synthient first confirmed on December 1, 2025 that the Kimwolf botnet operators were tunneling back through IPIDEA’s proxy network and into the local networks of systems running IPIDEA’s proxy software. The attackers dropped the malware payload by directing infected systems to visit a specific Internet address and to call out the pass phrase “krebsfiveheadindustries” in order to unlock the malicious download.

On December 30, Synthient said it was tracking roughly 2 million IPIDEA addresses exploited by Kimwolf in the previous week. Brundage said he has witnessed Kimwolf rebuilding itself after one recent takedown effort targeting its control servers — from almost nothing to two million infected systems just by tunneling through proxy endpoints on IPIDEA for a couple of days.

Brundage said IPIDEA has a seemingly inexhaustible supply of new proxies, advertising access to more than 100 million residential proxy endpoints around the globe in the past week alone. Analyzing the exposed devices that were part of IPIDEA’s proxy pool, Synthient said it found more than two-thirds were Android devices that could be compromised with no authentication needed.

SECURITY NOTIFICATION AND RESPONSE

After charting a tight overlap in Kimwolf-infected IP addresses and those sold by IPIDEA, Brundage was eager to make his findings public: The vulnerability had clearly been exploited for several months, although it appeared that only a handful of cybercrime actors were aware of the capability. But he also knew that going public without giving vulnerable proxy providers an opportunity to understand and patch it would only lead to more mass abuse of these services by additional cybercriminal groups.

On December 17, Brundage sent a security notification to all 11 of the apparently affected proxy providers, hoping to give each at least a few weeks to acknowledge and address the core problems identified in his report before he went public. Many proxy providers who received the notification were resellers of IPIDEA that white-labeled the company’s service.

KrebsOnSecurity first sought comment from IPIDEA in October 2025, in reporting on a story about how the proxy network appeared to have benefitted from the rise of the Aisuru botnet, whose administrators appeared to shift from using the botnet primarily for DDoS attacks to simply installing IPIDEA’s proxy program, among others.

On December 25, KrebsOnSecurity received an email from an IPIDEA employee identified only as “Oliver,” who said allegations that IPIDEA had benefitted from Aisuru’s rise were baseless.

“After comprehensively verifying IP traceability records and supplier cooperation agreements, we found no association between any of our IP resources and the Aisuru botnet, nor have we received any notifications from authoritative institutions regarding our IPs being involved in malicious activities,” Oliver wrote. “In addition, for external cooperation, we implement a three-level review mechanism for suppliers, covering qualification verification, resource legality authentication and continuous dynamic monitoring, to ensure no compliance risks throughout the entire cooperation process.”

“IPIDEA firmly opposes all forms of unfair competition and malicious smearing in the industry, always participates in market competition with compliant operation and honest cooperation, and also calls on the entire industry to jointly abandon irregular and unethical behaviors and build a clean and fair market ecosystem,” Oliver continued.

Meanwhile, the same day that Oliver’s email arrived, Brundage shared a response he’d just received from IPIDEA’s security officer, who identified himself only by the first name Byron. The security officer said IPIDEA had made a number of important security changes to its residential proxy service to address the vulnerability identified in Brundage’s report.

“By design, the proxy service does not allow access to any internal or local address space,” Byron explained. “This issue was traced to a legacy module used solely for testing and debugging purposes, which did not fully inherit the internal network access restrictions. Under specific conditions, this module could be abused to reach internal resources. The affected paths have now been fully blocked and the module has been taken offline.”

Byron told Brundage IPIDEA also instituted multiple mitigations for blocking DNS resolution to internal (NAT) IP ranges, and that it was now blocking proxy endpoints from forwarding traffic on “high-risk” ports “to prevent abuse of the service for scanning, lateral movement, or access to internal services.”

Brundage said IPIDEA appears to have successfully patched the vulnerabilities he identified. He also noted he never observed the Kimwolf actors targeting proxy services other than IPIDEA, which has not responded to requests for comment.

Riley Kilmer is founder of Spur.us, a technology firm that helps companies identify and filter out proxy traffic. Kilmer said Spur has tested Brundage’s findings and confirmed that IPIDEA and all of its affiliate resellers indeed allowed full and unfiltered access to the local LAN.

Kilmer said one model of unsanctioned Android TV boxes that is especially popular — the Superbox, which we profiled in November’s Is Your Android TV Streaming Box Part of a Botnet? — leaves Android Debug Mode running on localhost:5555.

“And since Superbox turns the IP into an IPIDEA proxy, a bad actor just has to use the proxy to localhost on that port and install whatever bad SDKs [software development kits] they want,” Kilmer told KrebsOnSecurity.

Both Brundage and Kilmer say IPIDEA appears to be the second or third reincarnation of a residential proxy network formerly known as 911S5 Proxy, a service that operated between 2014 and 2022 and was wildly popular on cybercrime forums. 911S5 Proxy imploded a week after KrebsOnSecurity published a deep dive on the service’s sketchy origins and leadership in China.

In that 2022 profile, we cited work by researchers at the University of Sherbrooke in Canada who were studying the threat 911S5 could pose to internal corporate networks. The researchers noted that “the infection of a node enables the 911S5 user to access shared resources on the network such as local intranet portals or other services.”

“It also enables the end user to probe the LAN network of the infected node,” the researchers explained. “Using the internal router, it would be possible to poison the DNS cache of the LAN router of the infected node, enabling further attacks.”

911S5 initially responded to our reporting in 2022 by claiming it was conducting a top-down security review of the service. But the proxy service abruptly closed up shop just one week later, saying a malicious hacker had destroyed all of the company’s customer and payment records. In July 2024, The U.S. Department of the Treasury sanctioned the alleged creators of 911S5, and the U.S. Department of Justice arrested the Chinese national named in my 2022 profile of the proxy service.

Kilmer said IPIDEA also operates a sister service called 922 Proxy, which the company has pitched from Day One as a seamless alternative to 911S5 Proxy.

“You cannot tell me they don’t want the 911 customers by calling it that,” Kilmer said.

Among the recipients of Synthient’s notification was the proxy giant Oxylabs. Brundage shared an email he received from Oxylabs’ security team on December 31, which acknowledged Oxylabs had started rolling out security modifications to address the vulnerabilities described in Synthient’s report.

Reached for comment, Oxylabs confirmed they “have implemented changes that now eliminate the ability to bypass the blocklist and forward requests to private network addresses using a controlled domain.” But it said there is no evidence that Kimwolf or other other attackers exploited its network.

“In parallel, we reviewed the domains identified in the reported exploitation activity and did not observe traffic associated with them,” the Oxylabs statement continued. “Based on this review, there is no indication that our residential network was impacted by these activities.”

PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS

Consider the following scenario, in which the mere act of allowing someone to use your Wi-Fi network could lead to a Kimwolf botnet infection. In this example, a friend or family member comes to stay with you for a few days, and you grant them access to your Wi-Fi without knowing that their mobile phone is infected with an app that turns the device into a residential proxy node. At that point, your home’s public IP address will show up for rent at the website of some residential proxy provider.

Miscreants like those behind Kimwolf then use residential proxy services online to access that proxy node on your IP, tunnel back through it and into your local area network (LAN), and automatically scan the internal network for devices with Android Debug Bridge mode turned on.

By the time your guest has packed up their things, said their goodbyes and disconnected from your Wi-Fi, you now have two devices on your local network — a digital photo frame and an unsanctioned Android TV box — that are infected with Kimwolf. You may have never intended for these devices to be exposed to the larger Internet, and yet there you are.

Here’s another possible nightmare scenario: Attackers use their access to proxy networks to modify your Internet router’s settings so that it relies on malicious DNS servers controlled by the attackers — allowing them to control where your Web browser goes when it requests a website. Think that’s far-fetched? Recall the DNSChanger malware from 2012 that infected more than a half-million routers with search-hijacking malware, and ultimately spawned an entire security industry working group focused on containing and eradicating it.

Much of what is published so far on Kimwolf has come from the Chinese security firm XLab, which was the first to chronicle the rise of the Aisuru botnet in late 2024. In its latest blog post, XLab said it began tracking Kimwolf on October 24, when the botnet’s control servers were swamping Cloudflare’s DNS servers with lookups for the distinctive domain 14emeliaterracewestroxburyma02132[.]su.

This domain and others connected to early Kimwolf variants spent several weeks topping Cloudflare’s chart of the Internet’s most sought-after domains, edging out Google.com and Apple.com of their rightful spots in the top 5 most-requested domains. That’s because during that time Kimwolf was asking its millions of bots to check in frequently using Cloudflare’s DNS servers.

The Chinese security firm XLab found the Kimwolf botnet had enslaved between 1.8 and 2 million devices, with heavy concentrations in Brazil, India, The United States of America and Argentina. Image: blog.xLab.qianxin.com

It is clear from reading the XLab report that KrebsOnSecurity (and security experts) probably erred in misattributing some of Kimwolf’s early activities to the Aisuru botnet, which appears to be operated by a different group entirely. IPDEA may have been truthful when it said it had no affiliation with the Aisuru botnet, but Brundage’s data left no doubt that its proxy service clearly was being massively abused by Aisuru’s Android variant, Kimwolf.

XLab said Kimwolf has infected at least 1.8 million devices, and has shown it is able to rebuild itself quickly from scratch.

“Analysis indicates that Kimwolf’s primary infection targets are TV boxes deployed in residential network environments,” XLab researchers wrote. “Since residential networks usually adopt dynamic IP allocation mechanisms, the public IPs of devices change over time, so the true scale of infected devices cannot be accurately measured solely by the quantity of IPs. In other words, the cumulative observation of 2.7 million IP addresses does not equate to 2.7 million infected devices.”

XLab said measuring Kimwolf’s size also is difficult because infected devices are distributed across multiple global time zones. “Affected by time zone differences and usage habits (e.g., turning off devices at night, not using TV boxes during holidays, etc.), these devices are not online simultaneously, further increasing the difficulty of comprehensive observation through a single time window,” the blog post observed.

XLab noted that the Kimwolf author shows an almost ‘obsessive’ fixation” on Yours Truly, apparently leaving “easter eggs” related to my name in multiple places through the botnet’s code and communications:

One frustrating aspect of threats like Kimwolf is that in most cases it is not easy for the average user to determine if there are any devices on their internal network which may be vulnerable to threats like Kimwolf and/or already infected with residential proxy malware.

Let’s assume that through years of security training or some dark magic you can successfully identify that residential proxy activity on your internal network was linked to a specific mobile device inside your house: From there, you’d still need to isolate and remove the app or unwanted component that is turning the device into a residential proxy.

Also, the tooling and knowledge needed to achieve this kind of visibility just isn’t there from an average consumer standpoint. The work that it takes to configure your network so you can see and interpret logs of all traffic coming in and out is largely beyond the skillset of most Internet users (and, I’d wager, many security experts). But it’s a topic worth exploring in an upcoming story.

Happily, Synthient has erected a page on its website that will state whether a visitor’s public Internet address was seen among those of Kimwolf-infected systems. Brundage also has compiled a list of the unofficial Android TV boxes that are most highly represented in the Kimwolf botnet.

If you own a TV box that matches one of these model names and/or numbers, please just rip it out of your network. If you encounter one of these devices on the network of a family member or friend, send them a link to this story and explain that it’s not worth the potential hassle and harm created by keeping them plugged in.

The top 15 product devices represented in the Kimwolf botnet, according to Synthient.

Chad Seaman is a principal security researcher with Akamai Technologies. Seaman said he wants more consumers to be wary of these pseudo Android TV boxes to the point where they avoid them altogether.

“I want the consumer to be paranoid of these crappy devices and of these residential proxy schemes,” he said. “We need to highlight why they’re dangerous to everyone and to the individual. The whole security model where people think their LAN (Local Internal Network) is safe, that there aren’t any bad guys on the LAN so it can’t be that dangerous is just really outdated now.”

“The idea that an app can enable this type of abuse on my network and other networks, that should really give you pause,” about which devices to allow onto your local network, Seaman said. “And it’s not just Android devices here. Some of these proxy services have SDKs for Mac and Windows, and the iPhone. It could be running something that inadvertently cracks open your network and lets countless random people inside.”

In July 2025, Google filed a “John Doe” lawsuit (PDF) against 25 unidentified defendants collectively dubbed the “BadBox 2.0 Enterprise,” which Google described as a botnet of over ten million unsanctioned Android streaming devices engaged in advertising fraud. Google said the BADBOX 2.0 botnet, in addition to compromising multiple types of devices prior to purchase, also can infect devices by requiring the download of malicious apps from unofficial marketplaces.

Google’s lawsuit came on the heels of a June 2025 advisory from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), which warned that cyber criminals were gaining unauthorized access to home networks by either configuring the products with malware prior to the user’s purchase, or infecting the device as it downloads required applications that contain backdoors — usually during the set-up process.

The FBI said BADBOX 2.0 was discovered after the original BADBOX campaign was disrupted in 2024. The original BADBOX was identified in 2023, and primarily consisted of Android operating system devices that were compromised with backdoor malware prior to purchase.

Lindsay Kaye is vice president of threat intelligence at HUMAN Security, a company that worked closely on the BADBOX investigations. Kaye said the BADBOX botnets and the residential proxy networks that rode on top of compromised devices were detected because they enabled a ridiculous amount of advertising fraud, as well as ticket scalping, retail fraud, account takeovers and content scraping.

Kaye said consumers should stick to known brands when it comes to purchasing things that require a wired or wireless connection.

“If people are asking what they can do to avoid being victimized by proxies, it’s safest to stick with name brands,” Kaye said. “Anything promising something for free or low-cost, or giving you something for nothing just isn’t worth it. And be careful about what apps you allow on your phone.”

Many wireless routers these days make it relatively easy to deploy a “Guest” wireless network on-the-fly. Doing so allows your guests to browse the Internet just fine but it blocks their device from being able to talk to other devices on the local network — such as shared folders, printers and drives. If someone — a friend, family member, or contractor — requests access to your network, give them the guest Wi-Fi network credentials if you have that option.

There is a small but vocal pro-piracy camp that is almost condescendingly dismissive of the security threats posed by these unsanctioned Android TV boxes. These tech purists positively chafe at the idea of people wholesale discarding one of these TV boxes. A common refrain from this camp is that Internet-connected devices are not inherently bad or good, and that even factory-infected boxes can be flashed with new firmware or custom ROMs that contain no known dodgy software.

However, it’s important to point out that the majority of people buying these devices are not security or hardware experts; the devices are sought out because they dangle something of value for “free.” Most buyers have no idea of the bargain they’re making when plugging one of these dodgy TV boxes into their network.

It is somewhat remarkable that we haven’t yet seen the entertainment industry applying more visible pressure on the major e-commerce vendors to stop peddling this insecure and actively malicious hardware that is largely made and marketed for video piracy. These TV boxes are a public nuisance for bundling malicious software while having no apparent security or authentication built-in, and these two qualities make them an attractive nuisance for cybercriminals.

Stay tuned for Part II in this series, which will poke through clues left behind by the people who appear to have built Kimwolf and benefited from it the most.

KrebsOnSecurity.com celebrates its 16th anniversary today! A huge “thank you” to all of our readers — newcomers, long-timers and drive-by critics alike. Your engagement this past year here has been tremendous and truly a salve on a handful of dark days. Happily, comeuppance was a strong theme running through our coverage in 2025, with a primary focus on entities that enabled complex and globally-dispersed cybercrime services.

In May 2024, we scrutinized the history and ownership of Stark Industries Solutions Ltd., a “bulletproof hosting” provider that came online just two weeks before Russia invaded Ukraine and served as a primary staging ground for repeated Kremlin cyberattacks and disinformation efforts. A year later, Stark and its two co-owners were sanctioned by the European Union, but our analysis showed those penalties have done little to stop the Stark proprietors from rebranding and transferring considerable network assets to other entities they control.

In December 2024, KrebsOnSecurity profiled Cryptomus, a financial firm registered in Canada that emerged as the payment processor of choice for dozens of Russian cryptocurrency exchanges and websites hawking cybercrime services aimed at Russian-speaking customers. In October 2025, Canadian financial regulators ruled that Cryptomus had grossly violated its anti-money laundering laws, and levied a record $176 million fine against the platform.

In September 2023, KrebsOnSecurity published findings from researchers who concluded that a series of six-figure cyberheists across dozens of victims resulted from thieves cracking master passwords stolen from the password manager service LastPass in 2022. In a court filing in March 2025, U.S. federal agents investigating a spectacular $150 million cryptocurrency heist said they had reached the same conclusion.

Phishing was a major theme of this year’s coverage, which peered inside the day-to-day operations of several voice phishing gangs that routinely carried out elaborate, convincing, and financially devastating cryptocurrency thefts. A Day in the Life of a Prolific Voice Phishing Crew examined how one cybercrime gang abused legitimate services at Apple and Google to force a variety of outbound communications to their users, including emails, automated phone calls and system-level messages sent to all signed-in devices.

Nearly a half-dozen stories in 2025 dissected the incessant SMS phishing or “smishing” coming from China-based phishing kit vendors, who make it easy for customers to convert phished payment card data into mobile wallets from Apple and Google. In an effort to wrest control over this phishing syndicate’s online resources, Google has since filed at least two John Doe lawsuits targeting these groups and dozens of unnamed defendants.

In January, we highlighted research into a dodgy and sprawling content delivery network called Funnull that specialized in helping China-based gambling and money laundering websites distribute their operations across multiple U.S.-based cloud providers. Five months later, the U.S. government sanctioned Funnull, identifying it as a top source of investment/romance scams known as “pig butchering.”

In May, Pakistan arrested 21 people alleged to be working for Heartsender, a phishing and malware dissemination service that KrebsOnSecurity first profiled back in 2015. The arrests came shortly after the FBI and the Dutch police seized dozens of servers and domains for the group. Many of those arrested were first publicly identified in a 2021 story here about how they’d inadvertently infected their computers with malware that gave away their real-life identities.

In April, the U.S. Department of Justice indicted the proprietors of a Pakistan-based e-commerce company for conspiring to distribute synthetic opioids in the United States. The following month, KrebsOnSecurity detailed how the proprietors of the sanctioned entity are perhaps better known for operating an elaborate and lengthy scheme to scam westerners seeking help with trademarks, book writing, mobile app development and logo designs.

Earlier this month, we examined an academic cheating empire turbocharged by Google Ads that earned tens of millions of dollars in revenue and has curious ties to a Kremlin-connected oligarch whose Russian university builds drones for Russia’s war against Ukraine.

An attack drone advertised on a website hosted in the same network as Russia’s largest private education company — Synergy University.

As ever, KrebsOnSecurity endeavored to keep close tabs on the world’s biggest and most disruptive botnets, which pummeled the Internet this year with distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) assaults that were two to three times the size and impact of previous record DDoS attacks.

In June, KrebsOnSecurity.com was hit by the largest DDoS attack that Google had ever mitigated at the time (we are a grateful guest of Google’s excellent Project Shield offering). Experts blamed that attack on an Internet-of-Things botnet called Aisuru that had rapidly grown in size and firepower since its debut in late 2024. Another Aisuru attack on Cloudflare just days later practically doubled the size of the June attack against this website. Not long after that, Aisuru was blamed for a DDoS that again doubled the previous record.

In October, it appeared the cybercriminals in control of Aisuru had shifted the botnet’s focus from DDoS to a more sustainable and profitable use: Renting hundreds of thousands of infected Internet of Things (IoT) devices to proxy services that help cybercriminals anonymize their traffic.

However, it has recently become clear that at least some of the disruptive botnet and residential proxy activity attributed to Aisuru last year likely was the work of people responsible for building and testing a powerful botnet known as Kimwolf. Chinese security firm XLab, which was the first to chronicle Aisuru’s rise in 2024, recently profiled Kimwolf as easily the world’s biggest and most dangerous collection of compromised machines — with approximately 1.83 million devices under its thumb as of December 17.

XLab noted that the Kimwolf author “shows an almost ‘obsessive’ fixation on the well-known cybersecurity investigative journalist Brian Krebs, leaving easter eggs related to him in multiple places.”

I am happy to report that the first KrebsOnSecurity stories of 2026 will go deep into the origins of Kimwolf, and examine the botnet’s unique and highly invasive means of spreading digital disease far and wide. The first in that series will include a somewhat sobering and global security notification concerning the devices and residential proxy services that are inadvertently helping to power Kimwolf’s rapid growth.

[30] Krebs on Security - Dismantling Defenses: Trump 2.0 Cyber Year in Review
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Fri, 19 Dec 2025 15:14:55 +0000

[TAM METİN - 3882 kelime]
The Trump administration has pursued a staggering range of policy pivots this past year that threaten to weaken the nation’s ability and willingness to address a broad spectrum of technology challenges, from cybersecurity and privacy to countering disinformation, fraud and corruption. These shifts, along with the president’s efforts to restrict free speech and freedom of the press, have come at such a rapid clip that many readers probably aren’t even aware of them all.

President Trump has repeatedly claimed that a primary reason he lost the 2020 election was that social media and Big Tech companies had conspired to silence conservative voices and stifle free speech. Naturally, the president’s impulse in his second term has been to use the levers of the federal government in an effort to limit the speech of everyday Americans, as well as foreigners wishing to visit the United States.

In September, Donald Trump signed a national security directive known as NSPM-7, which directs federal law enforcement officers and intelligence analysts to target “anti-American” activity, including any “tax crimes” involving extremist groups who defrauded the IRS. According to extensive reporting by journalist Ken Klippenstein, the focus of the order is on those expressing “opposition to law and immigration enforcement; extreme views in favor of mass migration and open borders; adherence to radical gender ideology,” as well as “anti-Americanism,” “anti-capitalism,” and “anti-Christianity.”

Earlier this month, Attorney General Pam Bondi issued a memo advising the FBI to compile a list of Americans whose activities “may constitute domestic terrorism.” Bondi also ordered the FBI to establish a “cash reward system” to encourage the public to report suspected domestic terrorist activity. The memo states that domestic terrorism could include “opposition to law and immigration enforcement” or support for “radical gender ideology.”

The Trump administration also is planning to impose social media restrictions on tourists as the president continues to ramp up travel restrictions for foreign visitors. According to a notice from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), tourists — including those from Britain, Australia, France, and Japan — will soon be required to provide five years of their social media history.

The CBP said it will also collect “several high value data fields,” including applicants’ email addresses from the past 10 years, their telephone numbers used in the past five years, and names and details of family members. Wired reported in October that the US CBP executed more device searches at the border in the first three months of the year than any other previous quarter.

The new requirements from CBP add meat to the bones of Executive Order 14161, which in the name of combating “foreign terrorist and public safety threats” granted broad new authority that civil rights groups warn could enable a renewed travel ban and expanded visa denials or deportations based on perceived ideology. Critics alleged the order’s vague language around “public safety threats,” creates latitude for targeting individuals based on political views, national origin, or religion. At least 35 nations are now under some form of U.S. travel restrictions.

In February, Trump ordered executive branch agencies to stop enforcing the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which froze foreign bribery investigations, and even allows for “remedial actions” of past enforcement actions deemed “inappropriate.”

The White House also disbanded the Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative and KleptoCapture Task Force — units which proved their value in corruption cases and in seizing the assets of sanctioned Russian oligarchs — and diverted resources away from investigating white-collar crime.

Also in February, Attorney General Pam Bondi dissolved the FBI’s Foreign Influence Task Force, an entity created during Trump’s first term designed to counter the influence of foreign governments on American politics.

In March 2025, Reuters reported that several U.S. national security agencies had halted work on a coordinated effort to counter Russian sabotage, disinformation and cyberattacks. Former President Joe Biden had ordered his national security team to establish working groups to monitor the issue amid warnings from U.S. intelligence that Russia was escalating a shadow war against Western nations.

In a test of prosecutorial independence, Trump’s Justice Department ordered prosecutors to drop the corruption case against New York Mayor Eric Adams. The fallout was immediate: Multiple senior officials resigned in protest, the case was reassigned, and chaos engulfed the Southern District of New York (SDNY) – historically one of the nation’s most aggressive offices for pursuing public corruption, white-collar crime, and cybercrime cases.

When it comes to cryptocurrency, the administration has shifted regulators at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) away from enforcement to cheerleading an industry that has consistently been plagued by scams, fraud and rug-pulls. The SEC in 2025 systematically retreated from enforcement against cryptocurrency operators, dropping major cases against Coinbase, Binance, and others.

Perhaps the most troubling example involves Justin Sun, the Chinese-born founder of crypto currency company Tron. In 2023, the SEC charged Sun with fraud and market manipulation. Sun subsequently invested $75 million in the Trump family’s World Liberty Financial (WLF) tokens, became the top holder of the $TRUMP memecoin, and secured a seat at an exclusive dinner with the president.

In late February 2025, the SEC dropped its lawsuit. Sun promptly took Tron public through a reverse merger arranged by Dominari Securities, a firm with Trump family ties. Democratic lawmakers have urged the SEC to investigate what they call “concerning ties to President Trump and his family” as potential conflicts of interest and foreign influence.

In October, President Trump pardoned Changpeng Zhao, the founder of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange Binance. In 2023, Zhao and his company pled guilty to failing to prevent money laundering on the platform. Binance paid a $4 billion fine, and Zhao served a four-month sentence. As CBS News observed last month, shortly after Zhao’s pardon application, he was at the center of a blockbuster deal that put the Trump’s family’s WLF on the map.

“Zhao is a citizen of the United Arab Emirates in the Persian Gulf and in May, an Emirati fund put $2 billion in Zhao’s Binance,” 60 Minutes reported. “Of all the currencies in the world, the deal was done in World Liberty crypto.”

SEC Chairman Paul Atkins has made the agency’s new posture towards crypto explicit, stating “most crypto tokens are not securities.” At the same time, President Trump has directed the Department of Labor and the SEC to expand 401(k) access to private equity and crypto — assets that regulators have historically restricted for retail investors due to high risk, fees, opacity, and illiquidity. The executive order explicitly prioritizes “curbing ERISA litigation,” and reducing accountability for fiduciaries while shifting risk onto ordinary workers’ retirement savings.

At the White House’s behest, the U.S. Treasury in March suspended the Corporate Transparency Act, a law that required companies to reveal their real owners. Finance experts warned the suspension would bring back shell companies and “open the flood gates of dirty money” through the US, such as funds from drug gangs, human traffickers, and fraud groups.

Trump’s clemency decisions have created a pattern of freed criminals committing new offenses, including Jonathan Braun, whose sentence for drug trafficking was commuted during Trump’s first term, was found guilty in 2025 of violating supervised release and faces new charges.

Eliyahu Weinstein, who received a commutation in January 2021 for running a Ponzi scheme, was sentenced in November 2025 to 37 years for running a new Ponzi scheme. The administration has also granted clemency to a growing list of white-collar criminals: David Gentile, a private equity executive sentenced to seven years for securities and wire fraud (functionally a ponzi-like scheme), and Trevor Milton, the Nikola founder sentenced to four years for defrauding investors over electric vehicle technology. The message: Financial crimes against ordinary investors are no big deal.

At least 10 of the January 6 insurrectionists pardoned by President Trump have already been rearrested, charged or sentenced for other crimes, including plotting the murder of FBI agents, child sexual assault, possession of child sexual abuse material and reckless homicide while driving drunk.

The administration also imposed sanctions against the International Criminal Court (ICC). On February 6, 2025, Executive Order 14203 authorized asset freezes and visa restrictions against ICC officials investigating U.S. citizens or allies, primarily in response to the ICC’s arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over alleged war crimes in Gaza.

Earlier this month the president launched the “Gold Card,” a visa scheme established by an executive order in September that offers wealthy individuals and corporations expedited paths to U.S. residency and citizenship in exchange for $1 million for individuals and $2 million for companies, plus ongoing fees. The administration says it is also planning to offer a “platinum” version of the card that offers special tax breaks — for a cool $5 million.

FEDERAL CYBERSECURITY

President Trump campaigned for a second term insisting that the previous election was riddled with fraud and had been stolen from him. Shortly after Mr. Trump took the oath of office for a second time, he fired the head of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) — Chris Krebs (no relation) — for having the audacity to state publicly that the 2020 election was the most secure in U.S. history.

Mr. Trump revoked Krebs’s security clearances, ordered a Justice Department investigation into his election security work, and suspended the security clearances of employees at SentinelOne, the cybersecurity firm where Krebs worked as chief intelligence and public policy officer. The executive order was the first direct presidential action against any US cybersecurity company. Krebs subsequently resigned from SentinelOne, telling The Wall Street Journal he was leaving to push back on Trump’s efforts “to go after corporate interests and corporate relationships.”

The president also dismissed all 15 members of the Cyber Safety Review Board (CSRB), a nonpartisan government entity established in 2022 with a mandate to investigate the security failures behind major cybersecurity events — likely because those advisors included Chris Krebs.

At the time, the CSRB was in the middle of compiling a much-anticipated report on the root causes of Chinese government-backed digital intrusions into at least nine U.S. telecommunications providers. Not to be outdone, the Federal Communication Commission quickly moved to roll back a previous ruling that required U.S. telecom carriers to implement stricter cybersecurity measures.

Meanwhile, CISA has lost roughly a third of its workforce this year amid mass layoffs and deferred resignations. When the government shutdown began in October, CISA laid off even more employees and furloughed 65 percent of the remaining staff, leaving only 900 employees working without pay.

Additionally, the Department of Homeland Security has reassigned CISA cyber specialists to jobs supporting the president’s deportation agenda. As Bloomberg reported earlier this year, CISA employees were given a week to accept the new roles or resign, and some of the reassignments included relocations to new geographic areas.

The White House has signaled that it plans to cut an additional $491 million from CISA’s budget next year, cuts that primarily target CISA programs focused on international affairs and countering misinformation and foreign propaganda. The president’s budget proposal justified the cuts by repeating debunked claims about CISA engaging in censorship.

The Trump administration has pursued a similar reorganization at the FBI: The Washington Post reported in October that a quarter of all FBI agents have now been reassigned from national security threats to immigration enforcement. Reuters reported last week that the replacement of seasoned leaders at the FBI and Justice Department with Trump loyalists has led to an unprecedented number of prosecutorial missteps, resulting in a 21 percent dismissal rate of the D.C. U.S. attorney’s office criminal complaints over eight weeks, compared to a mere .5% dismissal rate over the prior 10 years.

“These mistakes are causing department attorneys to lose credibility with federal courts, with some judges quashing subpoenas, threatening criminal contempt and issuing opinions that raise questions about their conduct,” Reuters reported. “Grand juries have also in some cases started rejecting indictments, a highly unusual event since prosecutors control what evidence gets presented.”

In August, the DHS banned state and local governments from using cyber grants on services provided by the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC), a group that for more than 20 years has shared critical cybersecurity intelligence across state lines and provided software and other resources at free or heavily discounted rates. Specifically, DHS barred states from spending funds on services offered by the Elections Infrastructure ISAC, which was effectively shuttered after DHS pulled its funding in February.

Cybersecurity Dive reports that the Trump administration’s massive workforce cuts, along with widespread mission uncertainty and a persistent leadership void, have interrupted federal agencies’ efforts to collaborate with the businesses and local utilities that run and protect healthcare facilities, water treatment plans, energy companies and telecommunications networks. The publication said the changes came after the US government eliminated CIPAC — a framework that allowed private companies to share cyber and threat intel without legal penalties.

“Government leaders have canceled meetings with infrastructure operators, forced out their longtime points of contact, stopped attending key industry events and scrapped a coordination program that made companies feel comfortable holding sensitive talks about cyberattacks and other threats with federal agencies,” Cybersecurity Dive’s Eric Geller wrote.

Both the National Security Agency (NSA) and U.S. Cyber Command have been without a leader since Trump dismissed Air Force General Timothy Haugh in April, allegedly for disloyalty to the president and at the suggestion of far-right conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer. The nomination of Army Lt. Gen. William Hartman for the same position fell through in October. The White House has ordered the NSA to cut 8 percent of its civilian workforce (between 1,500 and 2,000 employees).

As The Associated Press reported in August, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence plans to dramatically reduce its workforce and cut its budget by more than $700 million annually. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said the cuts were warranted because ODNI had become “bloated and inefficient, and the intelligence community is rife with abuse of power, unauthorized leaks of classified intelligence, and politicized weaponization of intelligence.”

The firing or forced retirements of so many federal employees has been a boon to foreign intelligence agencies. Chinese intelligence agencies, for example, reportedly moved quickly to take advantage of the mass layoffs, using a network of front companies to recruit laid-off U.S. government employees for “consulting work.” Former workers with the Defense Department’s Defense Digital Service who resigned en-masse earlier this year thanks to DOGE encroaching on their mission have been approached by the United Arab Emirates to work on artificial intelligence for the oil kingdom’s armed forces, albeit reportedly with the blessing of the Trump administration.

President Trump has filed multibillion-dollar lawsuits against a number of major news outlets over news segments or interviews that allegedly portrayed him in a negative light, suing the networks ABC, the BBC, the CBS parent company Paramount, The Wall Street Journal, and The New York Times, among others.

The president signed an executive order aimed at slashing public subsidies to PBS and NPR, alleging “bias” in the broadcasters’ reporting. In July, Congress approved a request from Trump to cut $1.1 billion in federal funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the nonprofit entity that funds PBS and NPR.

Brendan Carr, the president’s pick to run the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), initially pledged to “dismantle the censorship cartel and restore free speech rights for everyday Americans.” But on January 22, 2025, the FCC reopened complaints against ABC, CBS and NBC over their coverage of the 2024 election. The previous FCC chair had dismissed the complaints as attacks on the First Amendment and an attempt to weaponize the agency for political purposes.

President Trump in February seized control of the White House Correspondents’ Association, the nonprofit entity that decides which media outlets should have access to the White House and the press pool that follows the president. The president invited an additional 32 media outlets, mostly conservative or right-wing organizations.

According to the journalism group Poynter.org, there are three religious networks, all of which lean conservative, as well as a mix of outlets that includes a legacy paper, television networks, and a digital outlet powered by artificial intelligence.  Trump also barred The Associated Press from the White House over their refusal to refer to the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America.

Under Trump appointee Kari Lake, the U.S. Agency for Global Media moved to dismantle Voice of America, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, and other networks that for decades served as credible news sources behind authoritarian lines. Courts blocked shutdown orders, but the damage continues through administrative leave, contract terminations, and funding disputes.

President Trump this term has fired most of the people involved in processing Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests for government agencies. FOIA is an indispensable tool used by journalists and the public to request government records, and to hold leaders accountable.

Petitioning the government, particularly when it ignores your requests, often requires challenging federal agencies in court. But that becomes far more difficult if the most competent law firms start to shy away from cases that may involve crossing the president and his administration. On March 22, the president issued a memorandum that directs heads of the Justice and Homeland Security Departments to “seek sanctions against attorneys and law firms who engage in frivolous, unreasonable and vexatious litigation against the United States,” or in matters that come before federal agencies.

The Trump administration announced increased vetting of applicants for H-1B visas for highly skilled workers, with an internal State Department memo saying that anyone involved in “censorship” of free speech should be considered for rejection.

Executive Order 14161, issued in 2025 on “foreign terrorist and public safety threats,” granted broad new authority that civil rights groups warn could enable a renewed travel ban and expanded visa denials or deportations based on perceived ideology. Critics charged that the order’s vague language around “public safety threats” creates latitude for targeting individuals based on political views, national origin, or religion.

CONSUMER PROTECTION, PRIVACY

At the beginning of this year, President Trump ordered staffers at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to stop most work. Created by Congress in 2011 to be a clearinghouse of consumer complaints, the CFPB has sued some of the nation’s largest financial institutions for violating consumer protection laws. The CFPB says its actions have put nearly $18 billion back in Americans’ pockets in the form of monetary compensation or canceled debts, and imposed $4 billion in civil money penalties against violators.

The Trump administration said it planned to fire up to 90 percent of all CFPB staff, but a recent federal appeals court ruling in Washington tossed out an earlier decision that would have allowed the firings to proceed. Reuters reported this week that an employee union and others have battled against it in court for ten months, during which the agency has been almost completely idled.

The CFPB’s acting director is Russell Vought, a key architect of the GOP policy framework Project 2025. Under Vought’s direction, the CFPB in May quietly withdrew a data broker protection rule intended to limit the ability of U.S. data brokers to sell personal information on Americans.

Despite the Federal Reserve’s own post-mortem explicitly blaming Trump-era deregulation for the 2023 Silicon Valley Bank collapse, which triggered a fast-moving crisis requiring emergency weekend bailouts of banks, Trump’s banking regulators in 2025 doubled down. They loosened capital requirements, narrowed definitions of “unsafe” banking practices, and stripped specific risk categories from supervisory frameworks. The setup for another banking crisis requiring taxpayer intervention is now in place.

The Privacy Act of 1974, one of the few meaningful federal privacy laws, was built on the principles of consent and separation in response to the abuses of power that came to light during the Watergate era. The law states that when an individual provides personal information to a federal agency to receive a particular service, that data must be used solely for its original purpose.

Nevertheless, it emerged in June that the Trump administration has built a central database of all US citizens. According to NPR, the White House plans to use the new platform during upcoming elections to verify the identity and citizenship status of US voters. The database was built by the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Governmental Efficiency and is being rolled out in phases to US states.

Probably the biggest ungotten scoop of 2025 is the inside story of what happened to all of the personal, financial and other sensitive data that was accessed by workers at the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). President Trump tapped Elon Musk to lead the newly created department, which was mostly populated by current and former employees of Musk’s various technology companies (including a former denizen of the cybercrime community known as the “Com”). It soon emerged that the DOGE team was using artificial intelligence to surveil at least one federal agency’s communications for hostility to Mr. Trump and his agenda.

DOGE employees were able to access and synthesize data taken from a large number of previously separate and highly guarded federal databases, including those at the Social Security Administration, the Department of Homeland Security, the Office of Personnel Management, and the U.S. Department of the Treasury. DOGE staffers did so largely by circumventing or dismantling security measures designed to detect and prevent misuse of federal databases, including standard incident response protocols, auditing, and change-tracking mechanisms.

For example, an IT expert with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) alleges that DOGE employees likely downloaded gigabytes of data from agency case files in early March, using short-lived accounts that were configured to leave few traces of network activity. The NLRB whistleblower said the large data outflows coincided with multiple blocked login attempts from addresses in Russia, which attempted to use valid credentials for a newly-created DOGE user account.

The stated goal of DOGE was to reduce bureaucracy and to massively cut costs — mainly by eliminating funding for a raft of federal initiatives that had already been approved by Congress. The DOGE website claimed those efforts reduced “wasteful” and “fraudulent” federal spending by more than $200 billion. However, multiple independent reviews by news organizations determined the true “savings” DOGE achieved was off by a couple of orders of magnitude, and was likely closer to $2 billion.

At the same time DOGE was slashing federal programs, President Trump fired at least 17 inspectors general at federal agencies — the very people tasked with actually identifying and stopping waste, fraud and abuse at the federal level. Those included several agencies (such as the NLRB) that had open investigations into one or more of Mr. Musk’s companies for allegedly failing to comply with protocols aimed at protecting state secrets. In September, a federal judge found the president unlawfully fired the agency watchdogs, but none of them have been reinstated.

Where is DOGE now? Reuters reported last month that as far as the White House is concerned, DOGE no longer exists, even though it technically has more than half a year left to its charter. Meanwhile, who exactly retains access to federal agency data that was fed by DOGE into AI tools is anyone’s guess.

KrebsOnSecurity would like to thank the anonymous researcher NatInfoSec for assisting with the research on this story.

2.5 million people were affected, in a breach that could spell more trouble down the line.

EdFinancial and the Oklahoma Student Loan Authority (OSLA) are notifying over 2.5 million loanees that their personal data was exposed in a data breach.

The target of the breach was Nelnet Servicing, the Lincoln, Neb.-based servicing system and web portal provider for OSLA and EdFinancial, according to a breach disclosure letter.

Nelnet revealed the breach to affected loan recipients on July 21, 2022 via a letter.

“[Our] cybersecurity team took immediate action to secure the information system, block the suspicious activity, fix the issue, and launched[sic] an investigation with third-party forensic experts to determine the nature and scope of the activity,” according to the letter.

By August 17th, the investigation determined that personal user information was accessed by an unauthorized party. That exposed information included names, home addresses, email addresses, phone numbers and social security numbers for a total of 2,501,324 student loan account holders. Users’ financial information was not exposed.

According to a breach disclosure filing submitted by Nelnet’s general counsel, Bill Munn, to the state of Maine the breach occurred sometime between June 1, 2022 and July 22, 2022. However, a letter to affected customers pinpoints the breach to July 21. The breach was discovered on August 17, 2022.

“On July 21, 2022, Nelnet Servicing, LLC (Nelnet), our servicing system and customer website

portal provider, notified us that they had discovered a vulnerability that we believe led to this incident,” according to the Nelnet.

It’s unclear what the vulnerability was.

“On August 17, 2022, this investigation determined that certain student loan account registration information was accessible by an unknown party beginning in June 2022 and ending on July 22, 2022,” according to the letter.

Loan Recipient Targets

Although users’ most sensitive financial data was protected, the personal information that was accessed in the Nelnet breach “has potential to be leveraged in future social engineering and phishing campaigns,” explained Melissa Bischoping, endpoint security research specialist at Tanium, in a statement via email.

“With recent news of student loan forgiveness, it’s reasonable to expect the occasion to be used by scammers as a gateway for criminal activity,” Bischoping said.

Last week, the Biden administration announced a plan to cancel $10,000 of student loan debt for low- and middle-income loanees. She said the loan forgiveness program will be used to lure victims into opening up phishing emails.

She warns that recently breached data will be used to impersonate affected brands in waves of phishing campaigns targeting students and recent college graduates.

“Because they can leverage the trust from existing business relationships they can be particularly deceptive,” she wrote.

According to the breach disclosure Nelnet Servicing informed Edfinancial and OSLA that Nelnet Servicing’s cybersecurity team “took immediate action to secure the information system, block the suspicious activity, fix the issue, and launched an investigation with third-party forensic experts to determine the nature and scope of the activity.”

Remediation also included two years of free credit monitoring, credit reports and up to $1 million in identity theft insurance.

[32] Threatpost - Watering Hole Attacks Push ScanBox Keylogger
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Tue, 30 Aug 2022 16:00:43 +0000
Link: https://threatpost.com/watering-hole-attacks-push-scanbox-keylogger/180490/

[TAM METİN - 918 kelime]
Researchers uncover a watering hole attack likely carried out by APT TA423, which attempts to plant the ScanBox JavaScript-based reconnaissance tool.

A China-based threat actor has ramped up efforts to distribute the ScanBox reconnaissance framework to victims that include domestic Australian organizations and offshore energy firms in the South China Sea. The bait used by the advanced threat group (APT) is targeted messages that supposedly link back to Australian news websites.

The cyber-espionage campaigns are believed to have launched April 2022 through mid-June 2022, according to a Tuesday report by Proofpoint’s Threat Research Team and PwC’s Threat Intelligence team.

The threat actor, according to researchers, is believed to be the China-based APT TA423, also known as Red Ladon. “Proofpoint assesses with moderate confidence that this activity may be attributable to the threat actor TA423 / Red Ladon, which multiple reports assess to operate out of Hainan Island, China,” according to the report.

The APT is most recently known for a recent indictment. “A 2021 indictment by the US Department of Justice assessed that TA423 / Red Ladon provides long-running support to the Hainan Province Ministry of State Security (MSS),” researchers said.

MSS is the civilian intelligence, security and cyber police agency for the People’s Republic of China. It is believed responsible for counter-intelligence, foreign intelligence, political security and tied to industrial and cyber espionage efforts by China.

Dusting Off the ScanBox

The campaign leverages the ScanBox framework. ScanBox is a customizable and multifunctional Javascript-based framework used by adversaries to conducting covert reconnaissance.

ScanBox has been used by adversaries for nearly a decade and is noteworthy because criminals can use the tool to conduct counter intelligence without having to plant malware on a targets system.

“ScanBox is particularly dangerous as it doesn’t require malware to be successfully deployed to disk in order to steal information – the keylogging functionality simply requires the JavaScript code to be executed by a web browser,” according to PwC researchers referring to a previous campaign.

In lieu of malware, attackers can use ScanBox in conjunction with watering hole attacks. Adversaries load the malicious JavaScript onto a compromised website where the ScanBox acts as a keylogger snagging all of a user’s typed activity on the infected watering hole website.

TA423’s attacks began with phishing emails, with such titles as “Sick Leave,” “User Research” and “Request Cooperation.” Often, the emails purported to come from an employee of the “Australian Morning News,” a fictional organization. The employee implored targets to visit their “humble news website,” australianmorningnews[.]com.

“Upon clicking the link and redirecting to the site, visitors were served the ScanBox framework,” researchers wrote.

The link directed targets to a web page with content copied from actual news sites, like the BBC and Sky News. In the process, it also delivered the ScanBox malware framework.

ScanBox keylogger data culled from waterholes is part of a multi-stage attack, giving attackers insight into the potential targets that will help them launch future attacks against them. This technique is often called browser fingerprinting.

The primary, initial script sources a list of information about the target computer, including the operating system, language and version of Adobe Flash installed. ScanBox additionally runs a check for browser extensions, plugins and components such WebRTC.

“The module implements WebRTC, a free and open-source technology supported on all major browsers, which allows web browsers and mobile applications to perform real-time communication (RTC) over application programming interfaces (APIs). This allows ScanBox to connect to a set of pre-configured targets,” researchers explain.

Adversaries can then leverage a technology called STUN (Session Traversal Utilities for NAT). This is a standardized set of methods, including a network protocol, that allows interactive communications (including real-time voice, video, and messaging applications) to traverse network address translator (NAT) gateways, researchers explain.

“STUN is supported by the WebRTC protocol. Through a third-party STUN server located on the Internet, it allows hosts to discover the presence of a NAT, and to discover the mapped IP address and port number that the NAT has allocated for the application’s User Datagram Protocol (UDP) flows to remote hosts. ScanBox implements NAT traversal using STUN servers as part of Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE), a peer-to-peer communication method used for clients to communicate as directly as possible, avoiding having to communicate through NATs, firewalls, or other solutions,” according to researchers.

“This means that the ScanBox module can set up ICE communications to STUN servers, and communicate with victim machines even if they are behind NAT,” they explain.

The threat actors “support the Chinese government in matters related to the South China Sea, including during the recent tensions in Taiwan,” Sherrod DeGrippo, vice president of threat research and detection at Proofpoint, explained in a statement, “This group specifically wants to know who is active in the region and, while we can’t say for certain, their focus on naval issues is likely to remain a constant priority in places like Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, and Australia.”

The group has, in the past, expanded well beyond Australasia. According to a Department of Justice indictment from July, 2021, the group has “stolen trade secrets and confidential business information” from victims in “the United States, Austria, Cambodia, Canada, Germany, Indonesia, Malaysia, Norway, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Targeted industries included, among others, aviation, defense, education, government, health care, biopharmaceutical and maritime.”

Despite the DoJ indictment, analysts “have not observed a distinct disruption of operational tempo” from TA423, and they “collectively expect TA423 / Red Ladon to continue pursuing its intelligence-gathering and espionage mission.”

[33] Threatpost - Tentacles of ‘0ktapus’ Threat Group Victimize 130 Firms
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Mon, 29 Aug 2022 14:56:19 +0000

[TAM METİN - 614 kelime]
Over 130 companies tangled in sprawling phishing campaign that spoofed a multi-factor authentication system.

Targeted attacks on Twilio and Cloudflare employees are tied to a massive phishing campaign that resulted in 9,931 accounts at over 130 organizations being compromised. The campaigns are tied to focused abuse of identity and access management firm Okta, which gained the threat actors the 0ktapus moniker, by researchers.

“The primary goal of the threat actors was to obtain Okta identity credentials and multi-factor authentication (MFA) codes from users of the targeted organizations,” wrote Group-IB researchers in a recent report. “These users received text messages containing links to phishing sites that mimicked the Okta authentication page of their organization.”

Impacted were 114 US-based firms, with additional victims of sprinkled across 68 additional countries.

Roberto Martinez, senior threat intelligence analyst at Group-IB, said the scope of the attacks is still an unknown. “The 0ktapus campaign has been incredibly successful, and the full scale of it may not be known for some time,” he said.

What the 0ktapus Hackers Wanted

The 0ktapus attackers are believed to have begun their campaign by targeting telecommunications companies in hopes of winning access to potential targets’ phone numbers.

While unsure exactly how threat actors obtained a list of phone numbers used in MFA-related attacks, one theory researchers posit is that 0ktapus attackers began their campaign targeting telecommunications companies.

“[A]ccording to the compromised data analyzed by Group-IB, the threat actors started their attacks by targeting mobile operators and telecommunications companies and could have collected the numbers from those initial attacks,” researchers wrote.

Next, attackers sent phishing links to targets via text messages. Those links led to webpages mimicking the Okta authentication page used by the target’s employer. Victims were then asked to submit Okta identity credentials in addition to a multi-factor authentication (MFA) codes employees used to secure their logins.

In an accompanying technical blog, researchers at Group-IB explain that the initial compromises of mostly software-as-a-service firms were a phase-one in a multi-pronged attack. 0ktapus’ ultimate goal was to access company mailing lists or customer-facing systems in hopes of facilitating supply-chain attacks.

In a possible related incident, within hours of Group-IB publishing its report late last week, the firm DoorDash revealed it was targeted in an attack with all the hallmarks of an 0ktapus-style attack.

Blast Radius: MFA Attacks

In a blog post DoorDash revealed; “unauthorized party used the stolen credentials of vendor employees to gain access to some of our internal tools.” The attackers, according to the post, went on to steal personal information – including names, phone numbers, email and delivery addresses – from customers and delivery people.

In the course of its campaign, the attacker compromised 5,441 MFA codes, Group-IB reported.

“Security measures such as MFA can appear secure… but it is clear that attackers can overcome them with relatively simple tools,” researchers wrote.

“This is yet another phishing attack showing how easy it is for adversaries to bypass supposedly secure multifactor authentication,” Roger Grimes, data-driven defense evangelist at KnowBe4, wrote in a statement via email. “It simply does no good to move users from easily phish-able passwords to easily phish-able MFA. It’s a lot of hard work, resources, time, and money, not to get any benefit.”

To mitigate 0ktapus-style campaigns, the researchers recommended good hygiene around URLs and passwords, and using FIDO2-compliant security keys for MFA.

“Whatever MFA someone uses,” Grimes advised, “the user should be taught about the common types of attacks that are committed against their form of MFA, how to recognize those attacks, and how to respond. We do the same when we tell users to pick passwords but don’t when we tell them to use supposedly more secure MFA.”

[34] Threatpost - Ransomware Attacks are on the Rise
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Fri, 26 Aug 2022 16:44:27 +0000

[TAM METİN - 393 kelime]
Lockbit is by far this summer’s most prolific ransomware group, trailed by two offshoots of the Conti group.

After a recent dip, ransomware attacks are back on the rise. According to data released by NCC Group, the resurgence is being led by old ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) groups.

With data gathered by “actively monitoring the leak sites used by each ransomware group and scraping victim details as they are released,” researchers have determined that Lockbit was by far the most prolific ransomware gang in July, behind 62 attacks. That’s ten more than the month prior, and more than twice as many as the second and third most prolific groups combined. “Lockbit 3.0 maintain their foothold as the most threatening ransomware group,” the authors wrote, “and one with which all organizations should aim to be aware of.”

Those second and third most prolific groups are Hiveleaks – 27 attacks – and BlackBasta – 24 attacks. These figures represent rapid rises for each group – since June, a 440 percent rise for Hiveleaks, and a 50 percent rise for BlackBasta.

It may well be that the resurgence in ransomware attacks, and the rise of these two particular groups, are intimately connected.

Why Ransomware Has Bounced

Researchers from NCC Group counted 198 successful ransomware campaigns in July – up 47 percent from June. Sharp as that incline may be, it still falls some ways short of the high-water mark set this Spring, with nearly 300 such campaigns in both March and April.

Well, in May, the United States government ramped up its efforts against Russian cybercrime by offering up to $15 million for prized information about Conti, then the world’s foremost ransomware gang. “It is likely that the threat actors that were undergoing structural changes,” the authors of the report speculated, “and have begun settling into their new modes of operating, resulting in their total compromises increasing in conjunction.”

Hiveleaks and BlackBasta are the result of that restructuring. Both groups are “associated with Conti,” the authors noted, Hiveleaks as an affiliate and BlackBasta as a replacement strain. “As such, it appears that it has not taken long for Conti’s presence to filter back into the threat landscape, albeit under a new identity.”

Now that Conti’s properly split in two, the authors speculated, “it would not be surprising to see these figures further increase as we move into August.”

[35] Threatpost - Cybercriminals Are Selling Access to Chinese Surveillance Cameras
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Thu, 25 Aug 2022 18:47:15 +0000

[TAM METİN - 510 kelime]
Tens of thousands of cameras have failed to patch a critical, 11-month-old CVE, leaving thousands of organizations exposed.

New research indicates that over 80,000 Hikvision surveillance cameras in the world today are vulnerable to an 11 month-old command injection flaw.

Hikvision – short for Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology – is a Chinese state-owned manufacturer of video surveillance equipment. Their customers span over 100 countries (including the United States, despite the FCC labeling Hikvision “an unacceptable risk to U.S. national security” in 2019).

Last Fall, a command injection flaw in Hikvision cameras was revealed to the world as CVE-2021-36260. The exploit was given a “critical” 9.8 out of 10 rating by NIST.

Despite the severity of the vulnerability, and nearly a year into this story, over 80,000 affected devices remain unpatched. In the time since, the researchers have discovered “multiple instances of hackers looking to collaborate on exploiting Hikvision cameras using the command injection vulnerability,” specifically in Russian dark web forums, where leaked credentials have been put up for sale.

The extent of the damage done already is unclear. The authors of the report could only speculate that “Chinese threat groups such as MISSION2025/APT41, APT10 and its affiliates, as well as unknown Russian threat actor groups could potentially exploit vulnerabilities in these devices to fulfill their motives (which may include specific geo-political considerations).”

The Risk in IoT Devices

With stories like this, it’s easy to ascribe laziness to individuals and organizations that leave their software unpatched. But the story isn’t always so simple.

According to David Maynor, senior director of threat intelligence at Cybrary, Hikvision cameras have been vulnerable for many reasons, and for a while. “Their product contains easy to exploit systemic vulnerabilities or worse, uses default credentials. There is no good way to perform forensics or verify that an attacker has been excised. Furthermore, we have not observed any change in Hikvision’s posture to signal an increase in security within their development cycle.”

A lot of the problem is endemic to the industry, not just Hikvision. “IoT devices like cameras aren’t always as easy or straightforward to secure as an app on your phone,” Paul Bischoff, privacy advocate with Comparitech, wrote in a statement via email. “Updates are not automatic; users need to manually download and install them, and many users might never get the message. Furthermore, IoT devices might not give users any indication that they’re unsecured or out of date. Whereas your phone will alert you when an update is available and likely install it automatically the next time you reboot, IoT devices do not offer such conveniences.”

While users are none the wiser, cybercriminals can scan for their vulnerable devices with search engines like Shodan or Censys. The problem can certainly be compounded with laziness, as Bischoff noted, “by the fact that Hikvision cameras come with one of a few predetermined passwords out of the box, and many users don’t change these default passwords.”

Between weak security, insufficient visibility and oversight, it’s unclear when or if these tens of thousands of cameras will ever be secured.

[36] Threatpost - Twitter Whistleblower Complaint: The TL;DR Version
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Wed, 24 Aug 2022 14:17:04 +0000

[TAM METİN - 577 kelime]
Twitter is blasted for security and privacy lapses by the company’s former head of security who alleges the social media giant’s actions amount to a national security risk.

A recently surfaced 84-page whistleblower report filed with the US government by Twitter’s former head of security Peiter “Mudge” Zatko last month blasts his former employer for its alleged shoddy security practices and being out of compliance with an FTC order to protect user data.

Twitter has responded alleging that Zatko is a “disgruntled employee” who was fired for poor performance and leadership. In a letter to employees Twitter’s CEO Parag Agrawal asserts that Zatko’s claims are a “false narrative that is riddled with inconsistencies and inaccuracies, and presented without important context.”

Here is an abbreviated overview of the allegations and Twitter’s reaction.

Zatko, a respected white-hat hacker who served as Twitter’s head of security for roughly 15 months between 2020 and 2022, accused Twitter of a litany of poor security and privacy practices that together constituted a national security risk.

Top accusations include:

Twitter is a mismanaged company and gives too many of its staff access to sensitive security and privacy controls without adequate oversight.

One or more Twitter employees may be working for undisclosed foreign intelligence services. This, according to Zatko, elevates his concerns to a matter of national security.

Nearly half of Twitter’s servers lack basic security features, such as data encryption, because software running on them is either outdated or unpatched.

Twitter executives have prioritized growth over security as they have personally pursued massive bonuses, as high as $10 million, as incentives for the company’s rapid expansion.

The company is out of compliance with a 2010 FTC order to protect users’ personal information. Additionally, the company has lied to independent auditors of an FTC mandated “comprehensive information security program” tied to the 2010 order.

Twitter does not honor user requests to delete their personal data, because of technical limitations.

When Zatko attempted to bring these and many other security and privacy issues to Twitter’s board, company management misrepresented his finding and/or tried to hide the report.

Twitter allowed some foreign governments “… to infiltrate, control, exploit, surveil and/or censor the ‘company’s platform, staff, and operations,” according to the redacted whistleblower report submitted to congress.

Twitter does not have the resources or capacity to accurately determine the true number of fake (or bot) accounts on its platform. This question is central to a Elon Musk’s attempt to back out of buying the company for $44 billion.

Twitter’s Muted Response

The thrust of Twitter’s response to Zatko is that he is a disgruntled employee, bad at his job and scapegoating Twitter for his failures. It points out that it has addressed and continues to aggressively address many of the IT security issues pointed out by Zatko.

An alleged response by Twitter’s CEO Parag Agrawal sent internally to Twitter employees was posted online.

Meanwhile top Democrats and Republicans in Congress have reacted by promising to investigate the claims. Sen. Richard Durbin (D-IL), chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, confirmed he was investigating the whistleblower disclosure.

The whistleblower’s allegations of widespread security failures at Twitter, willful misrepresentations by top executives to government agencies, and penetration of the company by foreign intelligence raise serious concerns. https://t.co/9QQtlDSogr

[37] Threatpost - Firewall Bug Under Active Attack Triggers CISA Warning
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Tue, 23 Aug 2022 13:19:58 +0000
Link: https://threatpost.com/firewall-bug-under-active-attack-cisa-warning/180467/

[TAM METİN - 685 kelime]
CISA is warning that Palo Alto Networks’ PAN-OS is under active attack and needs to be patched ASAP.

Software running Palo Alto Networks’ firewalls is under attack, prompting U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to issue a warning to public and federal IT security teams to apply available fixes. Federal agencies urged to patch the bug by September 9.

Earlier this month, Palo Alto Networks issued a fix for the high-severity bug (CVE-2022-0028) that it says adversaries attempted to exploit. The flaw could be used by remote hackers to carry out reflected and amplified denial-of-service (DoS) attacks without having to authenticate targeted systems.

Palo Alto Networks maintains the flaw can only be exploited on a limited number of systems, under certain conditions and that the vulnerable systems are not part of a common firewall configuration. Any additional attacks exploiting the bug have either not occurred or been publicly reported.

Affected Products and OS Versions

Affected products include those running the PAN-OS firewall software include PA-Series, VM-Series and CN-Series devices. PAN-OS versions vulnerable to attack, with patches available, include PAN-OS prior to 10.2.2-h2, PAN-OS prior to 10.1.6-h6, PAN-OS prior to 10.0.11-h1, PAN-OS prior to 9.1.14-h4, PAN-OS prior to 9.0.16-h3 and PAN-OS prior to 8.1.23-h1.

According to Palo Alto Networks advisory; “A PAN-OS URL filtering policy misconfiguration could allow a network-based attacker to conduct reflected and amplified TCP denial-of-service (RDoS) attacks. The DoS attack would appear to originate from a Palo Alto Networks PA-Series (hardware), VM-Series (virtual) and CN-Series (container) firewall against an attacker-specified target.”

The advisory describes the non-standard configuration at risk as the “firewall configuration must have a URL filtering profile with one or more blocked categories assigned to a security rule with a source zone that has an external facing network interface.”

The configuration is likely unintended by the network administrator, the advisory said.

CISA Adds Bug to KEV Catalog

On Monday, CISA added the Palo Alto Networks bug to its list of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog.

The CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog is a curated list of flaws that have been exploited in the wild. It is also a list of KEVs that the agency “strongly recommends” public and private organizations pay close attention to in order to “prioritize remediation” to “reduce the likelihood of compromise by known threat actors.”

Reflective and Amplification DoS Attacks

One of the most notable evolutions in the DDoS landscape is the growth in the peak size of volumetric attacks. Attackers continue to use reflection/amplification techniques to exploit vulnerabilities in DNS, NTP, SSDP, CLDAP, Chargen and other protocols to maximize the scale of their attacks.

Reflected and amplified denial-of-service attacks are not new and have steadily become more common over the years.

Distributed denial of service attacks, bent on taking websites offline by overwhelming domains or specific application infrastructure with massive traffic flows, continue to pose a major challenge to businesses of all stripes. Being knocked offline impacts revenue, customer service and basic business functions – and worryingly, the bad actors behind these attacks are honing their approaches to become ever more successful over time.

Unlike limited volume DDoS attacks, reflective and amplified DoS attacks can produce much higher volumes of disruptive traffic. This type of attack allows an adversary to magnify the amount of malicious traffic they generate while obscuring the sources of the attack traffic. An HTTP-based DDoS attack, for example, sends junk HTTP requests to a target’s server tying up resources and locking out users from using a particular site or service.

A TCP attack, believed used in the recent Palo Alto Networks attack, is when an attacker sends a spoofed SYN packet, with the original source IP replaced by the victim’s IP address, to a range of random or pre-selected reflection IP addresses. The services at the reflection addresses reply with a SYN-ACK packet to the victim of the spoofed attack. If the victim does not respond, the reflection service will continue to retransmit the SYN-ACK packet, resulting in amplification. The amount of amplification depends on the number of SYN-ACK retransmits by the reflection service, which can be defined by the attacker.

[38] Threatpost - Fake Reservation Links Prey on Weary Travelers
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Mon, 22 Aug 2022 13:59:06 +0000

[TAM METİN - 695 kelime]
Fake travel reservations are exacting more pain from the travel weary, already dealing with the misery of canceled flights and overbooked hotels.

A longtime threat group identified as TA558 has ramped up efforts to target the travel and hospitality industries. After a lull in activity, believed tied to COVID-related travel restrictions, the threat group has ramped up campaigns to exploit an uptick in travel and related airline and hotel bookings.

Warnings come from security researchers who say TA558 cybercriminals have revamped their 2018 campaigns with fake reservation emails that contain links – that if clicked – deliver a malicious malware payload containing a potpourri of malware variants.

What makes this most recent campaign unique, according to a report by Proofpoint, is the use of RAR and ISO file attachments linked to messages. ISO and RAR are single compressed files, that if executed, decompress the file and folder data inside of them.

“TA558 began using URLs more frequently in 2022. TA558 conducted 27 campaigns with URLs in 2022, compared to just five campaigns total from 2018 through 2021. Typically, URLs led to container files such as ISOs or zip [RAR] files containing executables,” Proofpoint wrote.

To become infected, the targeted victim would have to be tricked into decompressing the file archive. “The reservation link… led to an ISO file and an embedded batch file. The execution of the BAT file led to a PowerShell helper script that downloaded a follow-on payload, AsyncRAT,” researchers wrote.

Upgrade Your Itinerary To Malware Infection Status

Past TA558 campaigns, tracked by Palo Alto Networks (in 2018), Cisco Talos (in 2020 and 2021) and Uptycs (in 2020), have leveraged malicious Microsoft Word document attachments (CVE-2017-11882) or remote template URLs to download and install malware, according to Proofpoint.

The shift to ISO and RAR files “is likely due to Microsoft’s announcements in late 2021 and early 2022 about disabling macros [VBA and XL4] by default in Office products,” researchers said.

“In 2022, campaign tempo increased significantly. Campaigns delivered a mixture of malware such as, Loda, Revenge RAT, and AsyncRAT. This actor used a variety of delivery mechanisms including URLs, RAR attachments, ISO attachments, and Office documents,” researchers wrote.

Malware payloads of recent campaigns typically include remote access trojans (RATs), that can enable reconnaissance, data theft and distribution of follow-on payloads, Proofpoint said.

Through all their evolutions, though, the goal of the group has always remained the same. The analysts concluded “with medium to high confidence” that TA558 is financially motivated, using stolen data to scale up and steal money. “Its possible compromises could impact both organizations in the travel industry as well as potentially customers who have used them for vacations,” Sherrod DeGrippo, vice president of threat research and detection organizations at Proofpoint, wrote in a statement. “Organizations in these and related industries should be aware of this actor’s activities and take precautions to protect themselves.”

Since at least 2018, TA558 has primarily targeted organizations in the fields of travel, hospitality, and related industries. Those organizations tend to be located in Latin America, and sometimes in North America or Western Europe.

Throughout their history, TA558 has used socially engineered emails to lure victims into clicking on malicious links or documents. Those emails – most often written in Portuguese or Spanish – usually purported to concern hotel reservations. The subject line, or the name of the attached document, was often, simply, “reserva.”

In their early exploits, the group would leverage vulnerabilities in Microsoft Word’s Equation Editor – for example, CVE-2017-11882, a remote code execution bug. The goal was to download a RAT – most commonly Loda or Revenge RAT – to the target machine.

In 2019 the group expanded its arsenal, with malicious macro-laced Powerpoint attachments and template injections against Office documents. They also expanded to new demographics, utilizing English-language phishing lures for the first time.

Early 2020 was TA558’s most prolific period, as they churned out 25 malicious campaigns in January alone. They predominantly used macro-laden Office documents, or targeted known Office vulnerabilities during this period.

“Organizations, especially those operating in targeted sectors in Latin America, North America, and Western Europe should be aware of this actor’s tactics, techniques, and procedures,” researchers advise.

[39] Threatpost - iPhone Users Urged to Update to Patch 2 Zero-Days
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Separate fixes to macOS and iOS patch respective flaws in the kernel and WebKit that can allow threat actors to take over devices and are under attack.

Apple is urging macOS, iPhone and iPad users immediately to install respective updates this week that includes fixes for two zero-days under active attack. The patches are for vulnerabilities that allow attackers to execute arbitrary code and ultimately take over devices.

Patches are available for effected devices running iOS 15.6.1 and macOS Monterey 12.5.1. Patches address two flaws, which basically impact any Apple device that can run either iOS 15 or the Monterey version of its desktop OS, according to security updates released by Apple Wednesday.

One of the flaws is a kernel bug (CVE-2022-32894), which is present both in iOS and macOS. According to Apple it is an “out-of-bounds write issue [that] was addressed with improved bounds checking.”

The vulnerability allows an application to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges, according to Apple, which, in usual vague fashion, said there is a report that it “may have been actively exploited.”

The second flaw is identified as a WebKit bug (tracked as CVE-2022-32893), which is an out-of-bounds write issue that Apple addressed with improved bounds checking. The flaw allows for processing maliciously crafted web content that can lead to code execution, and also has been reported to be under active exploit, according to Apple. WebKit is the browser engine that powers Safari and all other third-party browsers that work on iOS.

Pegasus-Like Scenario

The discovery of both flaws, about which little more beyond Apple’s disclosure are known, was credited to an anonymous researcher.

One expert expressed worry that the latest Apple flaws “could effectively give attackers full access to device,” they might create a Pegasus-like scenario similar to the one in which nation-state APTs barraged targets with spyware made by Israeli NSO Group by exploiting an iPhone vulnerability.

“For most folks: update software by end of day,” tweeted Rachel Tobac, the CEO of SocialProof Security, regarding the zero-days. “If threat model is elevated (journalist, activist, targeted by nation states, etc): update now,” Tobac warned.

The flaws were unveiled alongside other news from Google this week that it was patching its fifth zero-day so far this year for its Chrome browser, an arbitrary code execution bug under active attack.

The news of yet more vulnerabilities from top tech vendors being barraged by threat actors demonstrates that despite the best efforts from top-tier tech companies to address perennial security issues in their software, it remains an uphill battle, noted Andrew Whaley, senior technical director at Promon, a Norwegian app security company.

The flaws in iOS are especially worrying, given the ubiquity of iPhones and users’ utter reliance on mobile devices for their daily lives, he said. However, the onus is not only on vendors to protect these devices but also for users to be more aware of existing threats, Whaley observed.

“While we all rely on our mobile devices, they are not invulnerable, and as users we need to maintain our guard just like we do on desktop operating systems,” he said in an email to Threatpost.

At the same time, developers of apps for iPhones and other mobile devices also should add an extra layer of security controls in their technology so they are less reliant on OS security for protection, given the flaws that frequently crop up, Whaley observed.

“Our experience shows that this is not happening enough, potentially leaving banking and other customers vulnerable,” he said.

[40] Threatpost - Google Patches Chrome’s Fifth Zero-Day of the Year

An insufficient validation input flaw, one of 11 patched in an update this week, could allow for arbitrary code execution and is under active attack.

Google has patched the fifth actively exploited zero-day vulnerability discovered in Chrome this year as one in a series of fixes included in a stable channel update released Wednesday.

The bug, tracked as CVE-2022-2856 and rated as high on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), is associated with “insufficient validation of untrusted input in Intents,” according to the advisory posted by Google.

Google credits Ashley Shen and Christian Resell of its Google Threat Analysis Group (TAG) for reporting the zero-day bug, which could allow for arbitrary code execution, on July 19. The advisory also unveiled 10 other patches for various other Chrome issues.

Intents are a deep linking feature on the Android device within the Chrome browser that replaced URI schemes, which previously handled this process, according to Branch, a company that offers various linking options for mobile applications.

“Instead of assigning window.location or an iframe.src to the URI scheme, in Chrome, developers need to use their intent string as defined in this document,” the company explained on its website. Intent “adds complexity” but “automatically handles the case of the mobile app not being installed” within links, according to the post.

Insufficient validation is associated with input validation, a frequently-used technique for checking potentially dangerous inputs to ensure that they are safe for processing within the code, or when communicating with other components, according to MITRE’s Common Weakness Enumeration site.

“When software does not validate input properly, an attacker is able to craft the input in a form that is not expected by the rest of the application,” according to a post on the site. “This will lead to parts of the system receiving unintended input, which may result in altered control flow, arbitrary control of a resource, or arbitrary code execution.”

As is typical, Google did not disclose specific details of the bug until it is widely patched to avoid threat actors taking further advantage of it, a strategy that one security professional noted is a wise one.

“Publicizing details on an actively exploited zero-day vulnerability just as a patch becomes available could have dire consequences, because it takes time to roll out security updates to vulnerable systems and attackers are champing at the bit to exploit these types of flaws,” observed Satnam Narang, senior staff research engineer at cybersecurity firm Tenable, in an email to Threatpost.

Holding back info is also sound given that other Linux distributions and browsers, such as Microsoft Edge, also include code based on Google’s Chromium Project. These all could be affected if an exploit for a vulnerability is released, he said.

“It is extremely valuable for defenders to have that buffer,” Narang added.

While the majority of the fixes in the update are for vulnerabilities rated as high or medium risk, Google did patch a critical bug tracked as CVE-2022-2852, a use-after-free issue in FedCM reported by Sergei Glazunov of Google Project Zero on Aug. 8. FedCM—short for the Federated Credential Management API–provides a use-case-specific abstraction for federated identity flows on the web, according to Google.

Fifth Chrome 0Day Patch So Far

The zero-day patch is the fifth Chrome bug under active attack that Google has patched so far this year.

In July, the company fixed an actively exploited heap buffer overflow flaw tracked as CVE-2022-2294 in WebRTC, the engine that gives Chrome its real-time communications capability, while in May it was a separate buffer overflow flaw tracked as CVE-2022-2294 and under active attack that got slapped with a patch.

In April, Google patched CVE-2022-1364, a type confusion flaw affecting Chrome’s use of the V8 JavaScript engine on which attackers already had pounced. The previous month a separate type-confusion issue in V8 tracked as CVE-2022-1096 and under active attack also spurred a hasty patch.

February saw a fix for the first of this year’s Chrome zero-days, a use-after-free flaw in Chrome’s Animation component tracked as CVE-2022-0609 that already was under attack. Later it was revealed that North Korean hackers were exploiting the flaw weeks before it was discovered and patched.

[TAM METİN - 622 kelime]
Ireland’s Data Protection Commission has launched another investigation into X over Grok’s AI image generator. The probe focuses on reports that the tool created large volumes of non-consensual and sexualized images, including content involving children, potentially violating EU data protection laws.

“The Data Protection Commission (DPC) has today announced that it has opened an inquiry into X Internet Unlimited Company (XIUC) under section 110 of the Data Protection Act 2018.” reads the Ireland’s DPC’s press release. “The inquiry concerns the apparent creation, and publication on the X platform, of potentially harmful, non-consensual intimate and/or sexualised images, containing or otherwise involving the processing of personal data of EU/EEA data subjects, including children, using generative artificial intelligence functionality associated with the Grok large language model within the X platform.”

In January, X’s safety team blocked the @Grok account from editing images of real people to add revealing clothing, such as bikinis, for all users. Image creation and editing features now remain available only to paid subscribers, adding an accountability layer to deter abuse and policy violations.

“We have implemented technological measures to prevent the [@]Grok account on X globally from allowing the editing of images of real people in revealing clothing such as bikinis. This restriction applies to all users, including paid subscribers.” reads the X announcement. “Image creation and the ability to edit images via the [@]Grok account on X are now only available to paid subscribers globally. This adds an extra layer of protection by helping to ensure that individuals who attempt to abuse the [@]Grok account to violate the law or our policies can be held accountable.”

Ireland’s Data Protection Commission’s probe will assess whether X breached key GDPR provisions on lawful data processing, privacy by design, and impact assessments. As X’s lead EU regulator, the DPC said it had already engaged with the company and will now conduct a large-scale investigation into its compliance with fundamental data protection obligations.

“The decision to commence the inquiry was notified to XIUC on Monday 16 February.” Ireland’s DPC  continues. “The purpose of the inquiry is to determine whether XIUC has complied with its obligations under the GDPR, including its obligations under Article 5 (principles of processing), Article 6 (lawfulness of processing), Article 25 (Data Protection by Design and by Default) and Article 35 (requirement to carry out a Data Protection Impact Assessment) with regard to the personal data processed of EU/EEA data subjects.”

The Irish DPC joins a growing list of regulators investigating X, including the European Commission, the UK’s ICO and Ofcom, and authorities in Australia, Canada, India, Indonesia, and Malaysia. France has also been conducting a broad investigation since January, expanding its scope as new concerns arise.

“The DPC has been engaging with XIUC since media reports first emerged a number of weeks ago concerning the alleged ability of X users to prompt the @Grok account on X to generate sexualised images of real people, including children. As the Lead Supervisory Authority for XIUC across the EU/EEA, the DPC has commenced a large-scale inquiry which will examine XIUC’s compliance with some of their fundamental obligations under the GDPR in relation to the matters at hand.” said Deputy Commissioner Graham Doyle.

An interesting report published by the nonprofit watch group Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) estimates that Grok generated around 3 million sexualized images in just 11 days after X launched its image-editing feature, an average of about 190 per minute. Among them, roughly 23,000 appeared to depict children, or one every 41 seconds, plus another 9,900 cartoon sexualized images of minors. Researchers found that 29% of identified child images remained publicly accessible, highlighting the scale and speed of the content spread.

[42] Security Affairs - Intellexa’s Predator spyware infected Angolan journalist’s device, Amnesty reports
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Thu, 19 Feb 2026 08:17:16 +0000

[TAM METİN - 619 kelime]
Amnesty International reports that in May 2024, Intellexa’s Predator spyware infected the iPhone of Teixeira Cândido, an Angolan journalist and press freedom advocate, after he opened a malicious link sent via WhatsApp. This incident highlights how attackers actively target journalists for surveillance.

Predator is a powerful mobile spyware by Intellexa, sold to governments for surveillance. Investigations over five years documented abuses worldwide, despite Intellexa rebranding and shifting its corporate structure. The Angola case marks the first confirmed Predator attack there, showing the spyware remained active through 2025. Amnesty International and partners exposed Intellexa’s operations, but the responsible customers remain unknown.

Since 2022, Angolan journalist Teixeira Cândido faced multiple attacks and break-ins, raising suspicions of surveillance. From April to June 2024, an attacker posing as students sent him WhatsApp messages to gain his trust, eventually sending malicious links. On 4 May 2024, he clicked one link, infecting his iPhone with Intellexa’s Predator spyware. Once installed, the spyware gave attackers full access to his device, including messages, calls, emails, location, camera, microphone, passwords, and other sensitive data, illustrating a targeted and highly invasive surveillance operation.

“Through forensic analysis of the links and associated domain names, Amnesty International’s Security Lab determined with high confidence that all the links sent to Teixeira Cândido to this WhatsApp number were attempts to infect his phone with the Predator spyware. All infection domains matched a network fingerprint used to track Intellexa infection servers.” reads the report published by Amnesty International. “On 4 May 2024, one day after the first Predator infection link was received (Figure 4), Teixeira Cândido appears to have opened the infection link received, which would have resulted in the successful infection of the journalist’s phone with the Predator spyware.

On 4 May 2024, Amnesty International confirmed Predator spyware ran on Teixeira Cândido’s iPhone, executing from the directory /private/var/containers/Bundle/ under the name “iconservicesagent” to impersonate a system process.

His device ran the outdated iOS 16.2, potentially exposing it to known exploits, though Intellexa could also use zero-day vulnerabilities. The spyware remained active less than a day, but attackers sent 11 further malicious WhatsApp links through mid-June 2024. Forensic traces, network activity, and infection domains confirm this attack as Predator.

Amnesty International’s research shows Intellexa’s Predator spyware has targeted Angola since at least early 2023, with the attack on journalist Teixeira Cândido representing just part of broader activity. Predator communicates with spyware servers via domain names, many in Portuguese, revealing a regional focus. Technical analysis linked the domains used against Cândido to Predator, with earlier Angola-linked domains dating back to March 2023. Predator grants total access to devices, making independent audits nearly impossible.

Amnesty considers such spyware fundamentally incompatible with human rights. The Angola attack violates journalists’ rights to privacy and free expression, chilling civil society in a context of growing authoritarianism under President João Lourenço. Amnesty’s inquiries to Intellexa about its role and access to customer systems remain unanswered, raising concerns over the company’s legal and ethical responsibility in these abuses.

“While it remains unclear if Intellexa could access the specific Angolan deployment in 2024, the finding from Intellexa Leaks that the company had potential visibility into active surveillance operations of their customers, including seeing technical information about the targets, raises new legal questions about Intellexa’s role in relation to the spyware and the company’s potential legal or criminal responsibility for unlawful surveillance operations carried out using their products.” concludes the report. “This new case of spyware use against a journalist in Angola makes clear – yet again – that the unchecked sale and use of surveillance technologies continue to facilitate human rights abuses at a global scale. “

[TAM METİN - 318 kelime]
A hacker gained access to data from 1.2 million French bank accounts using stolen credentials belonging to a government official, according to the French Economy Ministry. French authorities said affected account holders will be notified in the coming days.

“The French Economy Ministry said on Wednesday, February 18, that a hacker gained access to a national bank account database and consulted information on 1.2 million accounts.” reports French daily newspaper LeMonde. “Since the end of January, the hacker used the stolen credentials of an official to access and consult “parts of the file of all of the accounts open in French banks and which contains personal data such as bank account numbers, name of the account holder, address and in certain cases the account owner’s tax number,” the ministry said in a statement.”

France’s Public Finances chief said the security breach did not allow access to account balances or transactions. After detecting the intrusion, the ministry immediately blocked the threat actor and acted to prevent any data from being removed.

Authorities filed a criminal complaint and notified the CNIL, France’s data protection authority, about the incident.

The Economy Ministry has not yet disclosed the hacker’s motivation. It remains unclear whether the attacker is a nation-state actor or a cybercriminal.

In December, a major cyber incident knocked offline the information systems at the French national postal service La Poste. The attack disrupted digital banking and online services for millions of customers.

The outage followed another cyberattack on France’s Interior Ministry, where a suspected hacker accessed sensitive police data; a 22-year-old was detained. The French Interior Minister Laurent Nunez announced that threat actors compromised email servers at the Ministry of the Interior.

The attack was detected overnight between December 11 and 12, and according to the French interior minister, attackers gained access to some document files, though data theft remains unconfirmed.

[44] Security Affairs - Notepad++ patches flaw used to hijack update system
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[TAM METİN - 822 kelime]
Notepad++ fixed a vulnerability that allowed a China-linked APT group to hijack its update mechanism and selectively push malware to chosen targets.

In early February, the Notepad++ maintainer revealed that nation-state hackers compromised the hosting provider’s infrastructure, redirecting update traffic to malicious servers. The attack did not exploit flaws in Notepad++ code but intercepted updates before they reached users.

“According to the analysis provided by the security experts, the attack involved infrastructure-level compromise that allowed malicious actors to intercept and redirect update traffic destined for notepad-plus-plus.org.” reads the advisory published by the software maintainers. “The exact technical mechanism remains under investigation, though the compromise occured at the hosting provider level rather than through vulnerabilities in Notepad++ code itself. Traffic from certain targeted users was selectively redirected to attacker-controlled served malicious update manifests.”

The incident began in June 2025 and was linked by multiple researchers to a likely Chinese state-sponsored group, based on its highly selective targeting. Attackers compromised a shared hosting server until September 2, 2025, and later used stolen internal credentials to redirect Notepad++ update traffic to malicious servers until December 2.

The hosting provider moved all affected customers to a new server, fixed the vulnerabilities that were abused, and rotated all credentials that may have been exposed.

After completing these actions, the provider reviewed system logs and confirmed there was no evidence of continued attacker access or malicious activity.

The security expert found the attack ended on November 10, 2025, while the hosting provider reported possible attacker access until December 2. Combining both assessments, the compromise likely lasted from June to December 2, 2025.

Rapid7 Labs and its MDR team uncovered a sophisticated campaign tied to the China-linked APT Lotus Blossom. Active since 2009, the group runs targeted espionage against government, telecom, aviation, critical infrastructure, and media organizations, mainly in Southeast Asia and Central America. The investigation traced a compromise of Notepad++ hosting infrastructure used to deploy a new custom backdoor, dubbed Chrysalis, along with stealthy loaders that abuse Microsoft Warbird to conceal malicious code execution.

“Our investigation identified a security incident stemming from a sophisticated compromise of the infrastructure hosting Notepad++, which was subsequently used to deliver a previously undocumented custom backdoor, which we have dubbed Chrysalis.” reads the report published by Rapid7.

Rapid7’s MDR team traced the initial access to the abuse of Notepad++ distribution infrastructure. Investigators saw notepad++.exe and GUP.exe run first, followed by a suspicious update.exe downloaded from an external IP. That file turned out to be an NSIS installer, a delivery method often used by Chinese APT groups. It dropped files into a hidden AppData folder and abused DLL sideloading through a renamed Bitdefender binary to decrypt and launch a custom backdoor called Chrysalis.

“Shortly after the execution of BluetoothService.exe, which is actually a renamed legitimate Bitdefender Submission Wizard abused for DLL sideloading, a malicious log.dll was placed alongside the executable, causing it to be loaded instead of the legitimate library.” continues the report. “Two exported functions from log.dll are called by Bitdefender Submission Wizard: LogInit and LogWrite.”

The malware relied on multiple layers of obfuscation to conceal its code and make analysis harder. It used custom API hashing to avoid calling Windows functions directly and encrypted its configuration to hide key settings. After running, it set up persistence to survive reboots, collected detailed information about the infected system, and connected to a remote command-and-control server. Through this connection, attackers could run commands, move files, and take full control of compromised machines.

Chrysalis supports full remote control, including command execution, file transfer, and interactive shells. Investigators also uncovered related loaders abusing Metasploit shellcode, Cobalt Strike beacons, and even Microsoft Warbird protections, showing long-term development and a complex, multi-stage attack chain.

Researchers attribute the campaign to Lotus Blossom based on strong overlaps with prior Symantec research, including a renamed Bitdefender tool used to sideload log.dll, similar loader chains, and shared Cobalt Strike public keys across multiple samples.

Notepad++ version 8.9.2 addressed the issue by introducing a “double lock” update system that verifies both the signed installer from GitHub and the signed XML from its update server to prevent abuse.

“This “double lock” design makes the Notepad++ update process robust and effectively unexploitable.” wrote the maintainer.

The release also strengthens the WinGUp auto-updater by removing libcurl.dll to block DLL side-loading, disabling insecure SSL options, and restricting plugin execution to programs signed with the same certificate.

Version 8.9.2 also addressed an Unsafe Search Path vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2026-25926 (CVSS score of 7.3), that could result in arbitrary code execution in the context of the running application.

“An Unsafe Search Path vulnerability (CWE-426) exists when launching Windows Explorer without an absolute executable path.” reads the advisory. “This may allow execution of a malicious explorer.exe if an attacker can control the process working directory. Under certain conditions, this could lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the running application.”

[45] Security Affairs - VS Code extensions with 125M+ installs expose users to cyberattacks

[TAM METİN - 394 kelime]
OX Security researchers warn that security flaws in four widely used VS Code extensions (Live Server, Code Runner, Markdown Preview Enhanced, and Microsoft Live Preview) could allow attackers to steal local files and execute code remotely. These extensions have been installed over 125 million times, putting many users at risk.

“The OX Security Research team found vulnerabilities in four popular VS Code extensions (later confirmed on Cursor and Windsurf). Three were assigned CVEs – CVE-2025-65715, CVE-2025-65716, and CVE-2025-65717 – totaling over 120 million downloads and posing a significant threat to developers worldwide.” reads the report published by OX Security. “Our research demonstrates that a hacker needs only one malicious extension, or a single vulnerability within one extension, to perform lateral movement and compromise entire organizations.“

IDE extensions act like mini-admins with broad access to users’ systems. If users install poorly designed or malicious extensions, attackers can run code, modify files, and take over their machines. Opening a project or clicking a file can let attackers move laterally, steal data, and gain full control, putting sensitive information at high risk.

Researchers disclosed three vulnerabilities in July–August 2025 but received no response from the maintainers, despite reaching out via email, GitHub, and social media. Months of disclosure attempts went unanswered, highlighting a systemic issue: extension security lacks accountability and incentives for timely fixes.

The experts remark that current “install at your own risk” model is no longer safe. Solutions include mandatory security reviews before publishing, AI-powered vulnerability scanning, and enforceable maintainer response rules. As AI coding assistants speed development and reliance on extensions grows, securing developer tools must start at the source.

The experts recommend users should avoid opening untrusted HTML while localhost servers run and avoid running unnecessary servers. They should never paste or run unverified snippets in global settings.json. Users must install only trusted extensions, monitor or back up settings.json, disable or remove non-essential extensions, harden local networks with firewalls, and promptly apply security updates to IDEs, extensions, OS, and development dependencies.

“The vulnerabilities discovered in these widely adopted VS Code extensions – collectively downloaded over 128 million times – expose a critical blind spot in modern development security.” concludes the report. “While organizations invest heavily in securing production environments, the developer’s local machine remains a largely unprotected gateway to an organization’s most sensitive assets.”

[46] Security Affairs - China-linked APT weaponized Dell RecoverPoint zero-day since 2024

[TAM METİN - 478 kelime]
Mandiant and Google’s Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) reported that a suspected China-linked APT group quietly exploited a critical zero-day flaw in Dell RecoverPoint for Virtual Machines starting in mid-2024.

“Mandiant and Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) have identified the zero-day exploitation of a high-risk vulnerability in Dell RecoverPoint for Virtual Machines, tracked as CVE-2026-22769, with a CVSSv3.1 score of 10.0.” reads the report published by Google. “Analysis of incident response engagements revealed that UNC6201, a suspected PRC-nexus threat cluster, has exploited this flaw since at least mid-2024 to move laterally, maintain persistent access, and deploy malware including SLAYSTYLE, BRICKSTORM, and a novel backdoor tracked as GRIMBOLT.”

The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2026-22769, involves hardcoded credentials and was abused to gain access to VMware backup systems.

“Dell RecoverPoint for Virtual Machines, versions prior to 6.0.3.1 HF1, contain a hardcoded credential vulnerability. This is considered critical as an unauthenticated remote attacker with knowledge of the hardcoded credential could potentially exploit this vulnerability leading to unauthorized access to the underlying operating system and root-level persistence. Dell recommends that customers upgrade or apply one of the remediations as soon as possible.” reads the advisory published by Dell.”Dell has received a report from Google/Mandiant of limited active exploitation of this vulnerability. Dell strongly recommends that customers apply one of the remediations below to address this vulnerability as soon as possible.”

The China-nexus group exploited the bug to move laterally, maintain persistence, and deploy malware such as SLAYSTYLE, BRICKSTORM, and a new C# backdoor, GRIMBOLT. Researchers observed advanced tactics, including stealthy VMware pivoting via “Ghost NICs” and Single Packet Authorization with iptables. Dell has released patches and mitigation guidance.

During investigations into compromised Dell RecoverPoint appliances, Mandiant researchers discovered that attackers replaced BRICKSTORM with a new C# backdoor, GRIMBOLT, in September 2025. GRIMBOLT is compiled using Native AOT and packed with UPX. The malware provides remote shell access and reuses BRICKSTORM’s command-and-control channels.

“It provides a remote shell capability and uses the same command and control as previously deployed BRICKSTORM payload.” continues the report. “It’s unclear if the threat actor’s replacement of BRICKSTORM with GRIMBOLT was part of a pre-planned life cycle iteration by the threat actor or a reaction to incident response efforts led by Mandiant and other industry partners.”

The attackers ensured persistence by modifying a legitimate startup script so the backdoor runs automatically at boot.

While investigating compromised Dell RecoverPoint systems, Mandiant uncovered CVE-2026-22769 after spotting Tomcat Manager access using hardcoded admin credentials. Attackers uploaded a malicious WAR file containing the SLAYSTYLE web shell, gaining root command execution as early as mid-2024. The group also expanded into VMware environments, creating “Ghost NICs” for stealthy lateral movement and using iptables-based Single Packet Authorization to covertly redirect and control traffic on vCenter appliances.

Google released Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) and Yara rules for this campaign.

[TAM METİN - 506 kelime]
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) added Google Chromium CSS, Microsoft Windows, TeamT5 ThreatSonar Anti-Ransomware, and Zimbra flaws to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog.

The first flaw added to the catalog is CVE-2026-2441, which is a Use after free in CSS component in Google Chrome prior to 145.0.7632.75. This week, Google released urgent security updates to address this high-severity zero-day vulnerability. This is the first actively exploited Chrome zero-day fixed in 2026, after eight similar flaws were patched in 2025.

An attacker could exploit the flaw to compromise affected systems. The issue was discovered and responsibly reported by security researcher Shaheen Fazim on February 11, 2026.

“CVE-2026-2441: Use after free in CSS. Reported by Shaheen Fazim on 2026-02-11.” reads the Google’s advisory. “Google is aware that an exploit for CVE-2026-2441 exists in the wild.”

Google has confirmed that an exploit for CVE-2026-2441 exists in the wild, but has not shared details about how it is being used or which threat actor is behind the exploitation of the flaw.

The second flaw, tracked as CVE-2024-7694, impacts TeamT5 ThreatSonar Anti-Ransomware. The issue is an arbitrary file upload vulnerability due to improper validation of uploaded content. An authenticated attacker with administrator privileges can upload crafted malicious files to the platform. This may allow arbitrary system command execution on the server, potentially leading to full system compromise, data exposure, and disruption of security functions.

The third flaw added to the catalog, tracked as CVE-2020-7796, impacts Zimbra Collaboration Suite (ZCS) before 8.8.15 Patch 7. The issue is an SSRF that can be exploited if the WebEx Zimlet is installed and its JSP component is enabled. An attacker can trick the server into making unauthorized outbound requests, potentially accessing internal services or sensitive resources. In March 2025, Threat intelligence firm GreyNoise observed Grafana path traversal exploitation attempts before the Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) surge on March 9, suggesting that attackers may be leveraging Grafana as an initial entry point for deeper exploitation. One of the vulnerabilities exploited in the attacks observed by the experts is CVE-2020-7796. Most Server-Side Request Forgery exploitation attempts targeted entities in the United States, Germany, Singapore, India, Lithuania, Japan, and Israel.

The experts warned that attackers leverage SSRF for pivoting and reconnaissance and cloud exploitation.

The last flaw added to the catalog, tracked as CVE-2008-0015, is a stack-based buffer overflow in the in CComVariant::ReadFromStream within ATL, used by the MPEG2TuneRequest ActiveX control (msvidctl.dll) in DirectShow, affects multiple legacy Windows versions. A crafted web page can trigger remote code execution. The flaw was exploited in the wild in July 2009.

According to Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities, FCEB agencies have to address the identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect their networks against attacks exploiting the flaws in the catalog.

Experts also recommend that private organizations review the Catalog and address the vulnerabilities in their infrastructure.

CISA orders federal agencies to fix the vulnerabilities by March 10, 2026.

[48] Security Affairs - Keenadu backdoor found preinstalled on Android devices, powers Ad fraud campaign
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Link: https://securityaffairs.com/188147/malware/keenadu-backdoor-found-preinstalled-on-android-devices-powers-ad-fraud-campaign.html

[TAM METİN - 737 kelime]
Kaspersky has identified a new Android malware called Keenadu. It can be preinstalled in device firmware, hidden inside system apps, or even distributed via official stores like Google Play. Currently used for ad fraud by turning infected phones into click bots, some variants also allow attackers to gain full remote control of compromised devices.

After uncovering the Triada backdoor in counterfeit Android firmware, researchers found another firmware-level threat called Keenadu. Like Triada, Keenadu embeds itself into the system during the build process, injects into the Zygote process, and infects every app launched on the device. It acts as a multi-stage loader, enabling full remote control, ad fraud, credential theft, and malicious payload delivery.

The researchers reported that some infected firmware was even pushed via OTA updates and built into core system apps. Investigators also linked Keenadu to major Android botnets, including Triada, BADBOX, and Vo1d.

Researchers found that Keenadu was embedded inside Android’s core library, libandroid_runtime.so, acting as a hidden dropper. A modified logging function decrypted an RC4-encrypted payload and loaded it into every app via the Zygote process. The malicious code uses a client-server setup called AKClient and AKServer.

“We discovered a new backdoor, which we dubbed Keenadu, in the firmware of devices belonging to several brands. The infection occurred during the firmware build phase, where a malicious static library was linked with libandroid_runtime.so. Once active on the device, the malware injected itself into the Zygote process, similarly to Triada. In several instances, the compromised firmware was delivered with an OTA update.” reads the report published by Kaspersky. “A copy of the backdoor is loaded into the address space of every app upon launch. The malware is a multi-stage loader granting its operators the unrestricted ability to control the victim’s device remotely.”

This design lets the attackers bypass Android permissions, give apps special privileges, steal data, install extra plugins, and connect to encrypted command-and-control servers. The malware also avoids infecting devices set to the Chinese language or devices that do not have Google services installed.

The researchers discovered that the backdoor was preinstalled in the firmware for Alldocube tablets. The malicious code traced to a rogue static library added during the build process. Attackers used valid digital signatures, a circumstance that suggests this was a supply chain compromise, likely introduced before devices reached the market, and affecting multiple vendors.

Keenadu’s backdoor gives attackers near-total control of infected Android devices and loads extra malicious modules from its C2 server. To avoid detection, the server waits about 2.5 months after activation before delivering payloads. The modules are downloaded from Amazon AWS, verified with MD5 and DSA signatures, then decrypted and executed.

Kaspersky identified multiple plugins: a loader targeting Amazon, SHEIN and Temu apps that can install hidden APKs; clicker modules injected into apps like YouTube, Facebook and system components to generate ad fraud; a Chrome module that steals search queries and hijacks results; and “Nova,” a clicker using advanced techniques to interact with ads.

Other modules monetize app installs, collect device data, retrieve advertising IDs, and may deploy spyware or additional droppers. Some victims reported tablets adding shopping cart items without their knowledge.

Researchers found Keenadu spreading beyond the original firmware compromise. The loader was embedded inside legitimate system apps, including a facial recognition service, launchers, and content center apps, where it was triggered by normal system events. Some variants relied on a native library to load modules and silently install APKs.

Other samples were deployed through a separate backdoor linked to BADBOX, suggesting cooperation between malware platforms. Keenadu was also distributed via modified popular apps from unofficial stores and even Google Play, where trojanized smart camera apps with over 300,000 downloads secretly launched the Nova clicker under specific conditions.

As of February 2026, Kaspersky detected more than 13,000 Android devices infected with Keenadu. Most victims were located in Russia, Japan, Germany, Brazil, and the Netherlands, although infections were reported in other countries as well.

” During the investigation, we were surprised by the scope of the Keenadu campaigns: beyond the primary backdoor in firmware, its modules were found in system apps and even in apps from Google Play.” concludes the report. “This places the Trojan on the same scale as threats like Triada or BADBOX. The emergence of a new pre-installed backdoor of this magnitude indicates that this category of malware is a distinct market with significant competition.”

[49] Security Affairs - SmartLoader hackers clone Oura MCP project to spread StealC malware

[TAM METİN - 546 kelime]
Straiker’s AI Research (STAR) Labs team uncovered a SmartLoader campaign in which attackers cloned a legitimate MCP server linked to Oura Health to spread the StealC information stealer. The fake project appeared credible, complete with bogus forks and contributors, to trick users into downloading a trojanized version. Once installed, it deployed malware designed to steal sensitive data.

“Our investigation revealed the threat actors cloned a legitimate Oura MCP Server—a tool that connects AI assistants to Oura Ring health data—and built a deceptive infrastructure of fake forks and contributors to manufacture credibility. The trojanized version of the Oura MCP server delivers the StealC infostealer, targeting developer credentials, browser passwords, and cryptocurrency wallets.” reads the report published by Straiker. “This campaign signals a significant shift in the threat landscape: traditional threat actors who have long targeted software supply chains are now pivoting to MCP ecosystems, bringing their proven tactics and operational sophistication to this emerging attack surface.”

Researchers say the SmartLoader operators spent months building a fake GitHub ecosystem to make their malware look trustworthy. They first chose a popular developer tool: the Oura MCP Server, a project created by an OpenAI engineer that connects AI assistants to Oura Ring data. The target was attractive because productivity-focused developers are likely to hold valuable credentials.

Next, the attackers created a network of fake GitHub accounts, forking the legitimate project to simulate real community interest. The main account, YuzeHao2023, created the initial clean fork:

Four additional accounts then forked the same project to make it appear popular and legitimate:

“These accounts exhibit characteristics consistent with AI-generated personas: recent creation dates, similar activity patterns, and commits concentrated in the same timeframe. The fake accounts also forked other projects from YuzeHao2023, creating a web of cross-references designed to make each account appear more established.” continues the report. “Any organization deploying MCP-enabled AI tools is vulnerable to supply chain compromise”

The researchers believe the accounts were AI-generated and cross-linked each other’s activity to appear established.

Once credibility was built, they launched a separate repository containing a trojanized version, deliberately excluding the original author to avoid scrutiny.

Finally, they submitted the malicious package to public MCP registries, so developers searching for Oura integrations would unknowingly download the infected version.

SmartLoader, a malware group known for spreading info-stealers through fake installers, has shifted tactics from targeting piracy users to compromising developers via the supply chain. The malware used LuaJIT, heavy virtual machine obfuscation, scheduled tasks disguised as Realtek drivers, and ultimately deployed StealC to steal passwords, crypto wallets, API keys, and cloud credentials. The infrastructure and techniques match known SmartLoader patterns, with indicators pointing to China-based operations. Security experts warn that developer environments are now prime targets and urge stronger vetting of AI tooling and MCP servers.

“SmartLoader’s campaign against the MCP ecosystem should serve as a wake-up call for security leaders. Threat actors have moved beyond opportunistic malware distribution and they are now investing in elaborate social engineering infrastructure to compromise developer supply chains.” concludes the report. “As AI assistants become integral to enterprise workflows, the MCP servers that extend their capabilities become a critical attack surface. Organizations that fail to secure this vector expose themselves to credential theft, data exfiltration, and supply chain compromise.”

[50] Security Affairs - Polish cybercrime Police arrest man linked to Phobos ransomware operation

Polish authorities arrested a 47-year-old man suspected of involvement in cybercrime and linked him to the Phobos ransomware operation. Police said they discovered evidence of illegal activities on his seized devices.

“Officers from the Central Bureau for Combating Cybercrime detained a 47-year-old man suspected of creating, acquiring, and sharing computer programs used to unlawfully obtain information stored in computer systems.” reads the press release published by Poland’s Central Bureau of Cybercrime Control (CBZC) police. “Officers secured files on the man’s computer containing digital data, such as logins, passwords, credit card numbers, and server IP addresses. This data could have been used to launch various attacks, including ransomware. Furthermore, the 47-year-old used encrypted messaging to contact the Phobos criminal group, known for its ransomware attacks.”

In a joint operation by cybercrime units in Katowice and Kielce, Polish authorities arrested the man in the Małopolska region over suspected links to the Phobos group. Investigators seized computers and mobile phones containing logins, passwords, credit card data, and server IP addresses that could be used to breach electronic systems and launch ransomware attacks.

Evidence also showed he used encrypted messaging to communicate with members of the criminal network. He has been charged with creating and distributing tools for unlawful access to computer systems, an offense punishable by up to five years in prison. The case is overseen by the District Prosecutor’s Office in Gliwice. The arrest was part of Operation Aether, coordinated by Europol, which has targeted Phobos operators, affiliates, and infrastructure worldwide.

Phobos is an organized cybercrime group operating a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model, providing its malware to affiliates who carry out attacks and share the profits. The group has targeted more than 1,000 victims worldwide, including U.S. public schools, healthcare providers, nonprofit organizations, government bodies, and private firms, even a contractor linked to the U.S. Department of Defense. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, ransom demands tied to Phobos exceeded $16 million. While the average demand was around $54,000, amounts varied widely. Exact earnings remain uncertain due to cryptocurrency payments and darknet activity.

In November 2024, Russian Phobos ransomware operator Evgenii Ptitsyn, suspected of playing a key role in the ransomware operations, was extradited from South Korea to the US to face cybercrime charges.

The Russian national was allegedly involved in the development, sale, distribution, and operations of the ransomware.

Evgenii Ptitsyn and others allegedly ran an international hacking scheme since November 2020, deploying Phobos ransomware to extort victims. Ptitsyn reportedly sold the ransomware on darknet forums under aliases like “derxan” and “zimmermanx,” enabling other criminals to encrypt data and demand ransom.

Ptitsyn and his conspirators used a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model to distribute their malware to a network of affiliates. Affiliates paid fees to administrators like Ptitsyn for decryption keys, with payments routed via unique cryptocurrency wallets from 2021–2024.

Could America turn off Europe’s internet?

That’s one of the questions that Graham and special guest James Ball will be exploring as they discuss tech sovereignty.  Could Gmail, cloud services, and critical infrastructure really become geopolitical leverage? And is anyone actually building a Plan B?

Plus we explore if Meta is quietly plotting to turn its smart glasses into face-recognising surveillance specs? With reports of internal memos suggesting they plan to launch controversial features while everyone’s distracted by political chaos, we ask: is this innovation really wanted by the public… or something far creepier?

All of this, and much more, in episode 455 of the award-winning “Smashing Security” podcast with cybersecurity veteran Graham Cluley, joined this week by journalist and author James Ball.

[52] Graham Cluley - Dutch police arrest man for “hacking” after accidentally sending him confidential files
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Link: https://www.bitdefender.com/en-us/blog/hotforsecurity/dutch-police-arrest-man-hacking-accidentally-sending-confidential-files

[TAM METİN - 457 kelime]
Well, this is embarrassing.

Police in The Netherlands say they have arrested a 40-year-old man on suspicion of hacking... after police officers accidentally sent him a link granting him access to their own confidential documents.

On February 12, the unnamed man from Ridderkerk contacted the Dutch National Police in connection with a separate investigation, telling them that he had images that might be helpful to their case.

The police officer handling the contact sent the man a link intended to allow him to upload the images. However, by mistake, the link that was sent to the man actually allowed him to access and download confidential files.

The man proceeded to download the documents. When police told him to stop and delete the downloaded material he reportedly refused, saying that he would only agree if he "received something in return."

Details of precisely what the man may have wanted as a "reward" has not been shared, but I think nobody would be surprised if it was of a financial nature.

Mistake as it was for the police to carelessly share a link which allowed confidential files to be downloaded, you cannot help but think that the member of the public was also not making the wisest decision of his life in blackmailing the authorities.

At around 7pm that evening, police arrested the man, searched his home, and seized digital devices in an attempt to recover their lost files and prevent their further distribution.

An investigation is now being undertaken into what wrong, and a data breach has been formally reported to regulators. Dutch police say that there is no indication that any of the leaked files have been shared more widely.

Announcing that they were charging the man with "computervredebreuk" — the Dutch legal term for unauthorised access to computer systems - polce attempted to justify their decision:

The nature of the leaked documents has not been disclosed, and it is unclear whether the material included personal data or information related to active police investigations.

Mistakes like the one which has befallen the Dutch police are painful reminder of just how easy it is for humans to foul up. A simple check of whether a link is an upload or download URL before firing it off to a member of the public would seem like a sensible precaution, particularly when the files on the other end belong to a law enforcement agency.

Right now the unnamed man faces a potential future prospecution for accessing files that he was in a very real sense, invited to access. Whatever the outcome of any court case (if it gets that far), one has to hope that the police will be more careful with the links that they send out in future.

[54] Graham Cluley - Polish hacker charged seven years after massive Morele.net data breach

[TAM METİN - 409 kelime]
A 29-year-old Polish man has been charged in connection with a data breach that exposed the personal details of around 2.5 million customers of the popular Polish e-commerce website Morele.net.

Poland's Central Cybercrime Bureau (CBZC) announced that charges were filed on 30 January 2026, following years of investigation into the 2018 breach of Morele.net, that specialises in electronics, computer equipment and home appliances.

The high-profile breach of Morele.net, whose international equivalents include the likes of Best Buy, Newegg, and Amazon, sent shockwaves through Poland's online retail sector.

The investigation into the data breach had originally been shelved after police failed to identify a suspect, but authorities claim that the trail never went entirely cold.

Over time investigators identified the attack vector, reconstructed the sequence of events, and traced digital breadcrumbs back to the alleged hacker - demonstrating their determination in a YouTube video.

According to a CBZC press release, the suspect has admitted responsibility for the hack.

The cyber attack exposed names, email addresses, phone numbers, home addresses, and md5crypt-hashed passwords. Although payment card details were not compromised in the breach, it was reported that some 35,000 customers did have particularly sensitive information stolen, including national ID numbers, financial details, education information, income, and marital status.

Morele.net refused to pay a ransom, and the breached database was published online.

Unfortunately for the site's users who had their information breached, fraudsters weaponised the stolen data immediately. Victims reported receiving SMS messages demanding payment of 1 Polish zloty to "complete" their orders, accompanied by phishing links that stole banking credentials.

In 2019, in what was one of the country's largest GDPR-related fines at the time, Poland's data protection authority regulator hit Morele.net to the tune of €645,000, claiming that had failed to detect and respond to unusual network traffic.

Morele.net contested the fine, arguing that its security measures were reasonable even if they ultimately proved insufficient against a determined attacker, and eventually Poland's Supreme Administrative Court annulled the penalty, saying it had finding deficiencies in the regulator's justification and calculation of the fine.

Now, however, it is the alleged hacker who will be hoping he can escape receiving a heavy punishment.

If anything, this case serves as a timely reminder to cybercriminals that they should not assume that they have evaded justice just because years have passed since their offence. Digital forensics techniques continue to improve, and law enforcement agencies are increasingly willing to pursue cold cases when new leads emerge.

AI bots are having existential crises, inventing religions, and allegedly plotting against humanity… or so the internet would have you believe.

We dig into Moltbook, the “AI-only” social network that sent Twitter into a meltdown, attracted breathless talk of the singularity, and turned out to be far less Terminator and far more humans role-playing as bots.

Plus we discuss why “vibe coding” your app might be a catastrophically bad idea, when security researchers can easily peek inside rifle through your private messages, API keys, and databases.

Also this week we learn that pro-Russian hackers are circling the Winter Olympics – or is it the Jamaican Bobsleigh team?

All this and more is discussed in episode 454 of the “Smashing Security” podcast with cybersecurity veteran Graham Cluley, and special guest Iain Thomson.

[56] Graham Cluley - Fake Dubai Crown Prince tracked to Nigerian mansion after $2.5M romance scam
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[TAM METİN - 653 kelime]
An investigation has tracked down a sophisticated scammer who posed as Dubai's Crown Prince in a succesful plot to defraud a Romanian businesswoman out of over US $2.5 million.

That in itself, sadly, is probably not that shocking a story. But what the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) discovered was that in this particular case the perpetrators presented themselves in the public eye as philanthropists, while secretly destroying victims' lives.

The victim, Laura (not her real name), was a successful Romanian businesswoman when she received a LinkedIn message three years ago from someone claiming to be the Crown Prince of Dubai.

The man said that he wanted her assistance in investing a large amount fo money in a humanitarian foundation in Romania. What followed was a textbook example of how modern romance scams can operate.

Over the next two years, the pair exchanged thousands of messages as a virtual romance developed. Meanwhile, Laura met a man who claimed to be the "Prince's financial manager" in London, where she was given login credentials to a bank account showing a deposit of over £200 million. The banking website was, of course, an elaborate fake.

Fortuitously, a friend of Laura's had helpfully photographed her meeting the "financial manager" - a snap that would later prove crucial.

Laura tried to withdraw funds from the account, only to receive demands for large fees to release "the Prince's funds." As Laura had already sent hundreds of thousands of dollars to her online beau, she kept on paying, believing that it was the only way to recover her money.

In total, she sent over US $2.5 million before realising that she had fallen victim to a con.

But things were not to go all the scammer's way. The fake prince had partners helping move the money, but they fell out over how the spoils of the scam should be divided. Ultimately they made contact with Laura, exposing the fraud and revealing the fake prince's real name: Nzube Henry Ikeji.

Laura was also sent videos of Ikeji at his newly-purchased mansion in Abuja, Nigeria.

Armed with this information, reporters from OCCRP travelled to Nigeria to track the scammer down.

Nigeria does not have extensive Google Street View coverage or complete property registries, and so OCCRP's Chikezie Omeje resorted to old-fashioned methods to locate Ikeji's mansion - spending days driving around Abuja until he found the matching mansion.

Meanwhile, the photograph taken by Laura's friend in London was shared with British police, who recognised the "financial manager" as Dr. Martins Abhulimhen, who they had coincidentally been investigating over suspicious bank transactions. These transactions, it transpired, were Laura's money, which police traced from Dr. Abhulimhen all the way to Nigeria and Ikeji himself.

But rather than hiding in the darkness like some shadowy criminal, Dr. Abhulimhen presented himself as a globe-trotting philanthropist and businessman, rubbing shoulders with powerful Nigerian officials and international figures. Until recently, for instance, he ran a foundation which campaigned against gender-based violence.

Bizarrely, Ikeji also runs a Nigerian humanitarian foundation, and according to British police some of Laura's stolen funds went directly to this charity.

A UK court has since returned to Laura over £113,000from Dr. Martins Abhulimhen's frozen bank accounts, but Laura has been told that any criminal investigation into her case would need to be led by Romanian authorities.

Laura's case may be extreme, but it's far from unique. Romance and investment scams have escalated worldwide, with organised crime syndicates recognising that online fraud can be a lucrative, easy, and comparatively safe way to make millions.

The FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center consistently ranks romance scams amongst the costliest forms of cybercrime, whilst UK victims lost over £92 million to romance fraud in 2023 alone.

Whether Ikeji or Dr. Abhulimhen will face justice remains unclear. But at least one fake prince has discovered that his Nigerian mansion offers rather less sanctuary than he had hoped.

[57] Graham Cluley - Incognito Market admin sentenced to 30 years for running $105 million dark web drug empire

[TAM METİN - 496 kelime]
A Taiwanese man who ran one of the world's largest dark web drugs marketplaces has been sentenced to 30 years in a US federal prison, in what the judge described as "the most serious drug crime I have ever been confronted with in 27.5 years."

24-year-old Rui-Siang Lin operated Incognito Market under the alias "Pharaoh" from October 2020 until March 2024, facilitating over $105 million in illegal drug sales to more than 400,000 customers across the globe.

The dark web marketplace, accessible via the Tor browser, hosted more than 1,800 vendors and processed over 640,000 transactions, selling cocaine, methamphetamine, heroin, MDMA, and counterfeit prescription medications.

Lin had overall control over the Incognito Market's operations, managing vendors, customers, and employees while taking a 5% commission for himself on every sale.

The site operated its own cryptocurrency payment system, dubbed "Incognito Bank", promising that users could "buy whatever you desire with the best security, friendly interface and streamlined user experience there is."

However, for all his technical prowess, Lin made a fundamental error in his own security that led to his downfall. Imvestigators were able to trace the site's domain registration back to Lin after he - astonishingly - used his real name, phone number, and address.

What is perhaps most remarkable, however, is that - as The Record reports - while managing Incognito Market from St Lucia, Lin ran a four-day training session for local police on "Cybercrime and Cryptocurrency" - even bragging about it on Facebook.

Things turned deadly in January 2022 when Lin allowed the sale of opiates on Incognito Market. Fake prescription pills started to be listed on the site - some of which were actually fentanyl disguised as oxycodone. In September 2022, a 27-year-old man from Arkansas died after taking pills he had bought from the site. Prosecutors said Lin's marketplace was directly responsible for the man's death.

In March 2024, Lin abruptly shut down Incognito Market without warning, stealing at least US $1 million in user deposits. He then attempted to extort users by threatening to publish their transaction histories and cryptocurrency addresses, writing "YES, THIS IS AN EXTORTION!!!" on the site.

In May 2024, Lin was arrested when he flew into New York's JFK Airport en route to Singapore, and subsequently pleaded guilty to drugs-related charges and money laundering.

US District Judge Colleen McMahon has now given Lin a 30-year prison sentence, describing Incognito Market as "a business that made [Lin] a drug kingpin." In addition to the prison term, Lin was sentenced to five years of supervised release and ordered to forfeit US $105,045,109.67.

According to US Attorney Jay Clayton, Lin was "responsible for at least one tragic death, and he exacerbated the opioid crisis and caused misery for more than 470,000 narcotics users and their families."

Lin has three decades in a US federal prison to ponder whether training the police in cybercrime while simultaneously running a massive drug marketplace was perhaps not the wisest decision of his life.

Supposedly redacted Jeffrey Epstein files can still reveal exactly who they’re talking about – especially when AI, LinkedIn, and a few biographical breadcrumbs do the heavy lifting.

Sloppy redaction leads to explosive claims, and difficult reputational consequences for cybersecurity vendors, and we learn how trust – once cracked – can be almost impossible to fully restore.

Elsewhere, the spotlight turns to insider threat in the age of AI, after a senior US cybersecurity official uploads sensitive government material into the public version of ChatGPT. Oops.

All this, and much more, in episode 453 of Smashing Security with cybersecurity veteran Graham Cluley and special guest Tricia Howard.

[59] Graham Cluley - FBI takes notorious RAMP ransomware forum offline
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Sat, 31 Jan 2026 09:43:26 +0000
Link: https://www.bitdefender.com/en-us/blog/hotforsecurity/fbi-takes-notorious-ramp-ransomware-forum-offline

[TAM METİN - 486 kelime]
The FBI has seized control of RAMP, a notorious cybercrime online forum that bragged to be "the only place ransomware allowed."

Both the forum's presence on the dark web and on its regular website domain now display a notice from the FBI announced that it has been taken over by the law enforcement agency.

According to the message posted on the seized websites, it was seized by the FBI in collaboration with the US Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida and the US Justice Department’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS).

The seizure banner comes complete with a cheeky addition - a winking Masha from the popular Russian children's TV cartoon series "Masha and the Bear."

Sure enough, RAMP's nameservers now point to ns1.fbi.seized.gov and ns2.fbi.seized.gov, confirming they have been seized by US law enforcement.

RAMP - the Russian Anonymous MarketPlace - first emerged in mid-2021. It quickly became popular, filling a void in the cybercriminal ecosystem, after other major Russian-language hacking forums banned ransomware-related content following pressure in the aftermath of the Colonial Pipeline attack by the DarkSide gang.

RAMP served as a marketplace where ransomware operators could recruit affiliates, where initial access brokers could sell credentials for compromised business networks, and where cybercriminals could trade their stolen data and tools.

Many infamous ransomware groups, such as ALPHV/BlackCat, Qilin, DragonForce, and RansomHub would use the RAMP platform to promote their operations.

The site was certainly popular, boasting in excess of 14,000 users even though it requested evidence of two months' activity on other hacking forums or a US $500 fee to join.

Things started to go badly wrong for RAMP, however, when one of the individuals behind the forum was named as Russian national Mikhail Matveev (also known as "Orange", "Wazawaka", and "BorisElcin." Matveev was listed on the FBI's most wanted list, and was subsequently (and unusually) arrested in Russia in 2024.

Following the seizure of RAMP, another of the forum's alleged operators, confirmed the takedown in a posting on another hacking forum.

"This event destroyed years of my work to create the most free forum in the world, and although I hoped this day would never come, deep down I always understood that it was possible," wrote "Stallman". "This is the risk we all take."

As Flare reports, "Stallman" has indicated that the cybercriminal activity conducted through RAMP would continue through other channels.

A seizure like this is not going to eliminate ransomware overnight, but it does represent a meaningful disruption of cybercriminal infrastructure, as hackers will be forced to migrate their activities, and will be presented with new challenges related to their operational security and who they can trust.

After all, the seizure of RAMP suggests that the authorities now have access to the site's user data - which is likely to include email and IP addresses, private messages, and more, which could lead to arrests in the coming months.

Tracking Malware Campaigns With Reused Material

A few days ago I wrote a diary called "Malicious Script Delivering More Maliciousness"[1]. In the malware infection chain, there was a JPEG picture that embedded the last payload delimited with "BaseStart-" and "-BaseEnd" tags.

Today, I discovered anoher campaign that relies exactly on the same technique. It started with an attachment called "TELERADIO_IB_OBYEKTLRIN_BURAXILIS_FORMASI.xIs" (SHA256:1bf3ec53ddd7399cdc1faf1f0796c5228adc438b6b7fa2513399cdc0cb865962). The file in itself is not interesting, it contains a good old Equation Editor exploit (CVE-2017-11882). The exploit triggers the download of an HTA payload that executes a PowerShell payload and finally a DLL:

When I investigated the different payload, there was pretty simple to deobfuscated, the interesting code was polluted with Unicode characters. First the HTA file was downloaded from:

The interesting code is here and you can easily spot the "powershell" string, no need to use AI for this :-)

The Powershell payload will fetch another file:

Do you make the link with my previous diary? It's the same picture:

The technique is also exactly the same, the next stage is Base64-encoded and delimited by the same tags:

The extracted payload is a .Net binary (SHA256:adc2f550e7ff2b707a070ffaa50fc367af6a01c037f1f5b347c444cca3c9a650).

The fast that the same picture is re-used looks interesting! I did a quick search on VT and use the feature to search for similarities based on the icon/thumbnail and found a lot of identical pictures:

846 similar pictures have been reported but only 36 have a VT score above 5. I created a YARA rule to track them, just curious...

Fake Incident Report Used in Phishing Campaign

This morning, I received an interesting phishing email. I’ve a “love & hate” relation with such emails because I always have the impression to lose time when reviewing them but sometimes it’s a win because you spot interesting “TTPs” (“tools, techniques &  procedures”). Maybe one day, I'll try to automate this process!

Today's email targets Metamask[1] users. It’s a popular software crypto wallet available as a browser extension and mobile app. The mail asks the victim to enable 2FA:

The link points to an AWS server: hxxps://access-authority-2fa7abff0e[.]s3.us-east-1[.]amazonaws[.]com/index.html

But it you look carefully at the screenshots, you see that there is a file attached to the message: “Security_Reports.pdf”. It contains a fake security incident report about an unusual login activity:

The goal is simple: To make the victim scary and ready to “increase” his/her security by enabled 2FA.

I had a look at the PDF content. It’s not malicious. Interesting, it has been generated through ReportLab[2], an online service that allows you to create nice PDF documents!

They also provide a Python library to create documents:

The PDF file is the SHA256 hash 2486253ddc186e9f4a061670765ad0730c8945164a3fc83d7b22963950d6dcd1.

Besides the idea to use a fake incident report, this campaign remains at a low quality level because the "From" is not spoofed, the PDF is not "branded" with at least the victim's email. If you can automate the creation of a PDF file, why not customize it?

2026 64-Bits Malware Trend

In 2022 (time flies!), I wrote a diary about the 32-bits VS. 64-bits malware landscape[1]. It demonstrated that, despite the growing number of 64-bits computers, the "old-architecture" remained the standard. In the SANS malware reversing training (FOR610[2]), we quickly cover the main differences between the two architectures. One of the conclusions is that 32-bits code is still popular because it acts like a comme denominator and allows threat actors to target more Windows computers. Yes, Microsoft Windows can smoothly execute 32-bits code on 64-bits computers. It is still the case in 2026? Did the situation evolved?

Last week, I make the exact same exercise and generated some statistics. I download the malware archive from Malware Bazaar[3] and re-executed my YARA rule.

2.167 ZIP archives (one per day)

1.120.034.288.112 bytes  (1.1TB)

Time line covered: from 2020/02/24 - 2026/02/05

346.985 samples analyzed (only PE files)

312.307 32-bits samples

34.677 64-bits samples

11% of 64-bits samples

First, an overview of the global malware trend over the complete time period:

Zoom on the last year:

Now the interesting graph: the 64-bits sample trend over the complete period:

Zoom on the last year:

We can clearly see that, compared to 2022, there is now a trend in 64-bits code! Have a look at the last 30 days:

We are getting close to a 50-50 repartition!

AI-Powered Knowledge Graph Generator & APTs

Unstructured text to interactive knowledge graph via LLM & SPO triplet extraction

Courtesy of TLDR InfoSec Launches & Tools again, another fine discovery in Robert McDermott’s AI Powered Knowledge Graph Generator. Robert’s system takes unstructured text, uses your preferred LLM and extracts knowledge in the form of Subject-Predicate-Object (SPO) triplets, then visualizes the relationships as an interactive knowledge graph.[1]

Robert has documented AI Powered Knowledge Graph Generator (AIKG) beautifully, I’ll not be regurgitating it needlessly, so please read further for details regarding features, requirements, configuration, and options. I will detail a few installation insights that got me up and running quickly.
The feature summary is this:
AIKG automatically splits large documents into manageable chunks for processing and uses AI to identify entities and their relationships. As AIKG ensures consistent entity naming across document chunks, it discovers additional relationships between disconnected parts of the graph, then creates an interactive graph visualization. AIKG works with any OpenAI-compatible API endpoint; I used Ollama exclusively here with Google’s Gemma 3, a lightweight family of models built on Gemini technology. Gemma 3 is multimodal, processing text and images, and is the current, most capable model that runs on a single GPU. I ran my experimemts on a Lenovo ThinkBook 14 G4 circa 2022 with an AMD Ryzen 7 5825U 8-core processor, Radeon Graphics, and 40gb memory running Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS.
My installation guidelines assume you have a full instance of Python3 and Ollama installed. My installation was implemented under my tools directory.

I opted to test AIKG via a couple of articles specific to Russian state-sponsored adversarial cyber campaigns as input:

CISA’s Cybersecurity Advisory Russian GRU Targeting Western Logistics Entities and Technology Companies May 2025

SecurityWeek’s Russia’s APT28 Targeting Energy Research, Defense Collaboration Entities January 2026

My use of these articles in particular was based on the assertion that APT and nation state activity is often well represented via interactive knowledge graph. I’ve advocated endlessly for visual link analysis and graph tech, including Maltego (the OG of knowledge graph tools) at far back as 2009, Graphviz in 2015, GraphFrames in 2018 and Beagle in 2019. As always, visualization, coupled with entity relationship mappings, are an imperative for security analysts, threat hunters, and any security professional seeking deeper and more meaningful insights. While the SecurityWeek piece is a bit light on content and density, it served well as a good initial experiment.
The CISA advisory is much more dense and served as an excellent, more extensive experiment.
I pulled them both into individual text files more easily ingested for processing with AIKG, shared for you here if you’d like to play along at home.

Starting with SecurityWeek’s Russia’s APT28 Targeting Energy Research, Defense Collaboration Entities, and the subsequent Russia-APT28-targeting.txt file I created for model ingestion, I ran Gemma 3 as a 12 billion parameter model as follows:

You may want or need to run Gemma 3 with fewer parameters depending on the performance and capabilities of your local system. Note that I am calling file paths rather explicitly to overcome complaints about missing config and input files.
The article makes reference to APT credential harvesting activity targeting people associated with a Turkish energy and nuclear research agency, as well as a spoofed OWA login portal containing Turkish-language text to target Turkish scientists and researchers. As part of it’s use of semantic triples (Subject-Predicate-Object (SPO) triplets), how does AIKG perform linking entities, attributes and values into machine readable statements [2] derived from the article content, as seen in Figure 1?

Figure 1: AIKG Gemma 3:12b result from SecurityWeek article

Quite well, I’d say. To manipulate the graph, you may opt to disable physics in the graph output toolbar so you can tweak node placements. As drawn from the statistics view for this graph, AIKG generated 38 nodes, 105 edges, 52 extracted edges, 53 inferred edges, and four communities. You can further filter as you see fit, but even unfiltered, and with just a little by of tuning at the presentation layer, we can immediately see success where semantic triples immediately emerge to excellent effect. We can see entity/relationship connections where, as an example, threat actor –> targeted –> people and people –> associated with –> think tanks, with direct reference to the aforementioned OWA portal and Turkish language. If you’re a cyberthreat intelligence analyst (CTI) or investigator, drawing visual conclusions derived from text processing will really help you step up your game in the form of context and enrichment in report writing. This same graph extends itself to represent the connection between the victims and the exploitation methods and infrastructure. If you don’t want to go through a full installation process for yourself to complete your own model execution, you should still grab the JSON and HTML output files and experiment with them in your browser. You’ll get a real sense of the power and impact of an interactive knowledge graph with the joint forces power of LLM and SPO triplets.
For a second experiment I selected related content in a longer, more in depth analysis courtesy of a CISA Cybersecurity Advisory (CISA friends, I’m pulling for you in tough times). If you are following along at home, be sure to exit ollama so you can rerun it with additional parameters (27b vs 12b); pass /bye as a message, and restart:

Given the density and length of this article, the graph as initially rendered is a bit untenable (no fault of AIKG) and requires some tuning and filtering for optimal effect. Graph Statistics for this experiment included 118 nodes, 486 edges, 152 extracted edges, 334 inferred edges, and seven communities. To filter, with a focus again on actions taken by Russian APT operatives, I chose as follows:

Select a Node by ID: threat actors

Select a network item: Nodes

Select a property: color

Select value(s): #e41a1c (red)

The result is more visually feasible, and allows ready tweaking to optimize network connections, as seen in Figure 2.

Figure 2: AIKG Gemma 3:27b result from CISA advisory

Shocking absolutely no one, we immediately encapsulate actor activity specific to credential access and influence operations via shell commands, Active Directory commands, and PowerShell commands. The conclusive connection is drawn however as threat actors –> targets –> defense industry. Ya think? ;-) In the advisory, see Description of Targets, including defense industry, as well as Initial Access TTPs, including credential guessing and brute force, and finally Post-Compromise TTPs and Exfiltration regarding various shell and AD commands. As a security professional reading this treatise, its reasonable to assume you’ve read a CISA Cybersecurity Advisory before. As such, its also reasonable to assume you’ll agree that knowledge graph generation from a highly dense, content rich collection of IOCs and behaviors is highly useful. I intend to work with my workplace ML team to further incorporate the principles explored herein as part of our context and enrichment generation practices. I suggest you consider the same if you have the opportunity. While SPO triplets, aka semantic triples, are most often associated with search engine optimization (SEO), their use, coupled with LLM power, really shines for threat intelligence applications.

Cheers…until next time.

GrayCharlie Hijacks Law Firm Sites in Suspected Supply-Chain Attack

Insikt Group has been monitoring GrayCharlie, a threat actor overlapping with SmartApeSG and active since mid-2023, for some time, and is now publishing its first report on the group. GrayCharlie compromises WordPress sites and injects them with links to externally hosted JavaScript that redirects visitors to NetSupport RAT payloads delivered via fake browser update pages or ClickFix mechanisms. These infections often progress to the deployment of Stealc and SectopRAT. Insikt Group identified a large amount of infrastructure linked to GrayCharlie, primarily tied to MivoCloud and HZ Hosting Ltd. This includes NetSupport RAT command-and-control (C2) servers, both actor-controlled and compromised staging infrastructure, and higher-tier infrastructure used to administer operations. While most compromised websites appear to be opportunistic and span numerous industries, Insikt Group identified a cluster of United States (US) law firm sites that were likely compromised around November 2025, possibly through a supply-chain compromise involving a shared IT provider.

To protect against GrayCharlie, security defenders should block IP addresses and domains tied to associated remote access trojans (RATs) and infostealers, flag and potentially block connections to compromised websites, and deploy updated detection rules (YARA, Snort, Sigma) for current and historical infections. Other controls include implementing email filtering and data exfiltration monitoring. See the Mitigations section of this report for implementation guidance and Appendix A for a complete list of indicators of compromise (IoCs).

GrayCharlie, which overlaps with SmartApeSG and first emerged in mid-2023, is a threat actor that injects links to externally hosted JavaScript into compromised WordPress sites. These links redirect victims to NetSupport RAT infections delivered via fake browser update pages or ClickFix techniques, ultimately resulting in Stealc and SectopRAT infections.

Insikt Group identified a wide range of GrayCharlie infrastructure, largely associated with MivoCloud and HZ Hosting Ltd. This includes NetSupport RAT command-and-control (C2) servers, staging infrastructure made up of both actor-controlled and compromised infrastructure, as well as components of GrayCharlie’s higher-tier infrastructure used to manage its operations.

Insikt Group identified two primary attack chains associated with GrayCharlie: one in which victims encounter fake browser update pages after visiting compromised websites, and another in which they are presented with a ClickFix pop-up, a technique that has become increasingly common in 2025.

GrayCharlie is Insikt Group’s designation for a threat activity group that first appeared in mid-2023 and is behind SmartApeSG, also referred to as ZPHP or HANEYMANEY. The group’s operations typically involve injecting malicious JavaScript into legitimate but compromised WordPress sites. Visitors to these sites are shown convincing, browser-specific fake update prompts (such as for Chrome, Edge, or Firefox) that encourage them to download what appears to be an update but is actually malware.

In late March or early April 2025, SmartApeSG shifted from using fake browser updates to deploying ClickFix lures, mirroring a broader trend among threat actors of increasingly adopting ClickFix.

GrayCharlie predominantly delivers NetSupport RAT; however, deployments of Stealc and, more recently, SectopRAT, have been observed in rare instances. The group’s ultimate objectives remain uncertain. Current evidence suggests a focus on data theft and financial gain, with a theoretical, but unsubstantiated, possibility that it may sell or transfer access to other threat actors.

Insikt Group has been tracking GrayCharlie for an extended period and has observed the actor’s persistent behavior since its emergence in 2023. GrayCharlie continues to conduct the same types of operations, regularly deploying large volumes of new infrastructure and adhering to consistent tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), including continued use of the same infection chains and NetSupport RAT payloads. The group targets organizations worldwide, with a particular focus on the US. The following sections provide a detailed examination of GrayCharlie’s operational infrastructure and its two primary attack chains.

Infrastructure Analysis

Insikt Group identified two main NetSupport RAT clusters linked to GrayCharlie based on factors such as TLS certificates, NetSupport serial numbers and license keys, and the timing of the activity (see Figure 1). In addition, Insikt Group identified a range of other NetSupport RAT C2 servers linked to GrayCharlie activity, but which are not currently attributed to either of the two main clusters. Insikt Group assesses that these clusters may correspond either to different individuals associated with GrayCharlie or to distinct GrayCharlie campaigns. The clusters are further described below.

Cluster 1 comprises NetSupport RAT C2 servers whose TLS certificates display a recurring monthly naming pattern. All servers in this cluster are hosted by MivoCloud and were deployed between March and August 2025. Notably, NetSupport RAT samples associated with the cluster’s March and April infrastructure used the license key DCVTTTUUEEW23 and serial number NSM896597, before shifting to the license key EVALUSION and serial number NSM165348 in subsequent deployments. The C2 servers associated with this cluster are listed in Table 1.

Table 1: NetSupport RAT C2 servers linked to Cluster 1 (Source: Recorded Future)

Notably, the NetSupport RAT C2 servers in Cluster 1 are connected not only through the characteristics previously described, but also by the near-simultaneous creation of their TLS certificates. For example, the TLS certificate with the common name june5ebatquot associated with IP address 94[.]158[.]245[.]135 was generated on June 30, 2025 at 4:55:20 PM, while the certificate with the common name june6 linked to 94[.]158[.]245[.]174 was created only 20 seconds later.

Cluster 2 comprises NetSupport RAT command-and-control servers whose TLS certificates typically start with two or more repetitions of “s”, followed by an “i” and a number (so “sssi3”, for example). NetSupport RAT samples linked to Cluster 2 used the license key XMLCTL and serial number NSM303008. The NetSupport RAT C2 servers typically also host an instance of the vulnerability scanner Acunetix. The C2 servers associated with this cluster are listed in Table 2. Notably, all TLS certificates associated with this cluster were created in a single batch on June 17, 2025.

Table 2: NetSupport RAT C2 servers linked to Cluster 2 (Source: Recorded Future)

Of note, one NetSupport RAT C2 server (94[.]158[.]245[.]56) used a TLS certificate with the common name 23sss, created in May 2025, and was linked to a NetSupport RAT sample that carried the same license key (EVALUSION) and serial number (NSM165348) previously observed in Cluster 1.

Insikt Group identified an additional set of NetSupport RAT C2 servers linked to GrayCharlie that did not form a distinct cluster (see Table 3). However, all the servers were hosted by MivoCloud and were associated with NetSupport RAT samples using license key and serial number combinations observed in Clusters 1 and 2.

Table 3: Additional NetSupport RAT C2 servers linked to GrayBravo (Source: Recorded Future)

Once GrayCharlie victims land on the compromised WordPress sites, thereby satisfying the conditional logic, the payload is typically fetched from the attacker-controlled infrastructure and injected into the compromised WordPress sites. Insikt Group has identified two distinct types of staging infrastructure, each characterized by different website templates. Type 1 is modeled after “Wiser University,” and Type 2 is modeled after “Activitar.”

The IP addresses associated with the Type 1 staging infrastructure are linked to websites impersonating “Wiser University” (see Figure 2), a fictional entity used to demonstrate Wiser, a free Bootstrap HTML5 education website template for school, college, and university websites. (As a sidenote, Oreshnik is the name of a Russian intermediate-range ballistic missile reportedly capable of speeds exceeding Mach 10.) Appendix B lists the IP addresses associated with the Type 1 staging infrastructure. All IP addresses, except for one, are announced by AS202015 (HZ Hosting Ltd).

Although most IP addresses associated with the Type 1 staging infrastructure are announced by AS202015, as shown in Appendix B, Insikt Group also identified a small subset announced by other ASNs that host the same websites (see Table 4). On average, approximately one such IP address appears to be established each month. Notably, most of these IP addresses appear to geolocate to Russia, and the same ASNs are consistently reused within the same timeframe.

Table 4: Additional infrastructure possibly linked to GrayCharlie (Source: Recorded Future)

Insikt Group identified an additional set of staging infrastructure, referred to as “Type 2.” The IP addresses in this cluster commonly host specific websites (see Figure 3). Insikt Group assesses that this template was sourced elsewhere and is not unique to GrayCharlie.

A subset of domains and IP addresses associated with Type 2 is presented in Table 5. Notably, most of the IP addresses are also announced by AS202015 (HZ Hosting Ltd), and one domain in Table 5, filmlerzltyazilimsx[.]shop, is linked to the email address oreshnik[@]mailum[.]com through its WHOIS record.

Table 5: Domains and IP addresses linked to Type 2 staging infrastructure (Source: Recorded Future)

GrayCharlie commonly injects malicious scripts into the Document Object Model (DOM) of compromised WordPress sites using script tags. Insikt Group has identified several recurring URL patterns tied to this activity: some URLs load externally hosted JavaScript files (such as hxxps://joiner[.]best/work/original[.]js), while others call a PHP file on specific endpoints using an ID parameter (such as hxxps://signaturepl[.]com/work/index[.]php?abje2LAw). Notably, these URLs are updated over time by the threat actor, complicating detection and indicating the threat actor maintains ongoing access to a large pool of compromised WordPress installations. Appendix A lists a subset of WordPress websites infected by GrayCharlie.

Although the exact initial access vector is unknown, it is likely that the actors either purchase access, such as via malware logs containing WordPress admin credentials, or exploit vulnerable WordPress plugins. The latter remains the most frequent cause of all WordPress compromises.

While the GrayCharlie-linked compromised WordPress sites span a wide range of industry verticals, in a few rare instances, the threat actors appear to have obtained, either through their own intrusions or via a third party, a more targeted set of WordPress domains. Specifically, at least fifteen websites belonging to US law firms were observed loading the external JavaScript hosted at hxxps://persistancejs[.]store/work/original[.]js (see Table 6).

Insikt Group assesses that GrayCharlie (or the third party GrayCharlie works with) likely compromised these websites through a supply-chain vector. One potential avenue is SMB Team, the self-described “fastest-growing law firm acceleration company,” which has supported thousands of firms across North America, according to its website, as its logo and other references appear across many of the websites listed in Table 6 (see Figure 4). Notably, credentials associated with an SMB Team email address used for a WordPress hosting platform surfaced around the same time that the domain persistancejs[.]store first began resolving. This temporal overlap suggests that the threat actors may have gained access to SMB Team-related infrastructure through the use of legitimate, compromised credentials.

Table 6: Compromised law firm websites linked to GrayCharlie (Source: Recorded Future)

Notably, while an SMB Team compromise is possible, Insikt Group also assesses that the actors may have exploited a specific version of WordPress or its plugins used by SMB Team, which could explain the simultaneous compromise of all affected websites.

In some instances, the same compromised WordPress sites are compromised by multiple threat actors simultaneously. For example, bianchilawgroup[.]com was also breached by TAG-124 (also known as LandUpdate808 or Kongtuke) since at least December 2025, which used the domain vimsltd[.]com.

GrayCharlie administers its staging infrastructure primarily over SSH, though other ports are used intermittently. The group manages its NetSupport RAT C2 servers over TCP port 443. Overall, Insikt Group assesses that GrayCharlie relies extensively on proxy services to administer its infrastructure. Additionally, based on presumed browsing activity from higher-tier servers, at least some individuals linked to GrayCharlie are assessed to be Russian-speaking.

Attack-Chain Analysis

GrayCharlie has been observed using two different attack chains to deliver NetSupport RAT. The first chain uses compromised websites to distribute a fake browser update that triggers the retrieval and installation of a script-based payload; the second chain uses compromised WordPress sites and a ClickFix-style lure that copies a command to fetch and install the RAT. Both culminate in NetSupport execution from %AppData%, Registry Run key persistence, and C2 connectivity; the technical details are expanded below.

According to public reporting, when GrayCharlie first became active in mid-2023, it relied on fake browser updates to deliver the NetSupport RAT. Although the group later shifted to the ClickFix technique, Insikt Group observed a return to fake browser updates as early as October 12, 2025. Figure 5 provides an overview of Attack Chain 1.

Website compromise and lure delivery. Threat actors modify legitimate sites to load malicious scripts that render a browser-specific “update” prompt. Selecting the prompt initiates download of a ZIP “update” package containing a primary JavaScript file alongside decoy .dat files.

User-executed JavaScript loader. The victim manually runs the .js script. The script mimics a benign browser component to reduce suspicion while silently initiating the next stage of the attack.

PowerShell staging via WScript. The JavaScript launches wscript.exe, which spawns powershell.exe. PowerShell reaches out to a remote host to fetch an obfuscated JavaScript containing encoded tasking.

Secondary payload retrieval. PowerShell decodes instructions and downloads the actual payload ZIP archive. This archive contains a complete NetSupport RAT client set, including client32.exe and required DLLs.

File deployment and execution. The archive is extracted under the user profile (for example, %AppData%\Roaming\...). client32.exe is started in the background to minimize visible indicators to the user.

Persistence establishment. A Windows Run registry key is created to automatically launch client32.exe at logon, ensuring the NetSupport RAT remains active after reboots without requiring further user interaction.

C2 readiness. With the NetSupport RAT client running on the infected host, the endpoint is prepared to establish command-and-control connectivity with the attacker's infrastructure.

As early as April 2025, GrayCharlie began using ClickFix as a secondary attack chain, consistent with industry reporting that many threat actors have adopted ClickFix techniques due to their effectiveness. Figure 6 provides an overview of Attack Chain 2.

Initial delivery and redirection. Phishing emails, malicious PDFs, or links on gaming sites direct users to compromised WordPress pages that embed attacker JavaScript.

Background script and profiling. A background script loads when the site is visited, injects an iframe, and profiles the environment (such as the operating system and browser) to deliver the next stage.

ClickFix fake CAPTCHA. The page presents a fake CAPTCHA that quietly copies a malicious command to the user’s clipboard and instructs them to paste it into the Windows Run dialog (Win+R), turning social engineering into user-assisted execution (see Figure 7).

Command-driven staging. The pasted command retrieves a batch file that downloads a ZIP containing NetSupport RAT and uses PowerShell to extract it into %AppData%\Roaming\ (see Figure 8).

Figure 8: PowerShell command (Source: Cybereason)

NetSupport RAT launch and persistence. The batch file starts client32.exe and sets a Run registry key to automatically relaunch the NetSupport RAT client at startup, establishing persistence on the endpoint.

Remote access and follow-on actions. Once connected to C2, operators can interact with the system, perform reconnaissance (for example, domain group membership queries), transfer files, execute additional commands, and potentially move laterally using access acquired from the host.

Observed Operator Activity

In October 2025, Insikt Group detonated a NetSupport RAT sample (SHA256: 31804c48f9294c9fa7c165c89e487bfbebeda6daf3244ad30b93122bf933c79c) with the C2 server 5[.]181[.]156[.]234[:]443 linked to GrayCharlie within a controlled environment. Later that day, approximately three hours later, the threat actor connected using NetSupport RAT, compressed and moved two files, and then executed group and account reconnaissance commands. The same actor returned three days later and repeated the previously observed reconnaissance commands (see Figure 9).

Figure 9: Reconnaissance commands (Source: Recorded Future)

When both files were compressed into a single ZIP archive and the executable was detonated, the process sideloaded a DLL identified as Sectop RAT (SHA256: 59e7e7698d77531bfbfea4739d29c14e188b5d3109f63881b9bcc87c72e9de78) with the C2 server 85[.]158[.]110[.]179[:]15847. The executable (SHA256: 5f1bd92ad6edea67762c7101cb810dc28fd861f7b8c62e6459226b7ea54e1428) was identified as “Merge XML Files”, version 1.2.0.0, developed by Vovsoft, and was signed with a digital certificate that expired on October 31, 2025.

Leverage the IoCs in Appendix A and Appendix B to investigate potential past or ongoing infections, both successful and attempted; Recorded Future customers can use the Recorded Future Intelligence Operations Platform to monitor for future IoCs associated with GrayCharlie.

Monitor for validated infrastructure associated with the malware families discussed in this report, including NetSupport RAT and Stealc, as well as numerous others identified and validated by Insikt Group, and integrate these indicators into relevant detection and monitoring systems.

Leverage the Sigma, YARA, and Snort rules provided in Appendices D, E, and F in your security information and event management (SIEM) or endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools to detect the presence or execution of NetSupport RAT. Customers can use additional detection rules available in the Recorded Future Intelligence Operations Platform.

Use Recorded Future Network Intelligence to detect instances of data exfiltration from your corporate infrastructure to known malicious infrastructure.

Use the Recorded Future Intelligence Operations Platform to monitor GrayCharlie, other threat actors, and the broader cybercriminal ecosystem, ensuring visibility into the latest tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), preferred tools and services (for example, specific threat activity enablers [TAEs] used by threat actors), and emerging developments.

Use Recorded Future AI’s reporting feature to generate tailored reports on topics that matter to your company. For example, if you want to stay informed about activities related to GrayCharlie, you can receive regular AI-generated updates on this threat actor.

GrayCharlie has been operating for more than two years, and despite shifts in its tactics, such as alternating between fake updates and ClickFix techniques or transitioning from SmartApe to other hosting providers like MivoCloud, the group’s core behaviors have remained consistent. Given its sustained activity, GrayCharlie is highly likely to remain active and continue targeting organizations worldwide, with a current emphasis on US entities, as indicated by Recorded Future Network Intelligence.

Insikt Group will continue to closely monitor GrayCharlie to detect emerging threats and evaluate the group’s strategic direction within the broader cybercriminal ecosystem.

Network Intelligence: Your Questions, Global Answers

The Problem with Pre-Packaged Intelligence

Security teams are drowning in threat intelligence feeds. Hundreds of vendors promise comprehensive coverage, real-time alerts, and actionable insights. Yet sophisticated adversaries continue to operate undetected, incidents take weeks to scope, and attribution remains elusive.

The fundamental issue isn't quality but control. Traditional network visibility solutions force passive consumption: their alerts, their priorities, their timeline. This one-size-fits-all approach assumes threats targeting financial services match those facing critical infrastructure, or that yesterday's patterns predict tomorrow's campaigns.

Network intelligence flips this model. With global visibility spanning billions of connections across 150+ sensors in 35+ countries, you investigate what matters to your organization using your own selectors, questions, and mission requirements.

What Network Intelligence Actually Means

Effective network intelligence requires global visibility at scale: distributed sensors across dozens of countries processing billions of packets daily, generating tens of millions of network flow records. But collection methodology matters equally. Metadata-only approaches capture source and destination IPs, ports, protocols, flow counts, and timestamps without payloads or deep packet inspection. This enables operation at internet scale while maintaining strict ethical boundaries and data minimization standards.

At Recorded Future, our network intelligence query capability provides this access to global network traffic observations for specific IP addresses of interest. Our Insikt Group uses this same infrastructure to research 500+ malware families and threat actors. Government CERTs use these capabilities to track adversary infrastructure at national scale.

What This Means in Practice

Consider what changes when your security operations can query global network intelligence.

Your team flags a suspicious IP at 2 AM. Instead of guessing whether it's noise or the start of something worse, query the network intelligence platform. See its global communication patterns instantly. Understand whether you're looking at commodity scanning or infrastructure that's been quietly staging against targets for weeks. Internet scanner detection capabilities automatically classify the behavior and reveal specific ports targeted, web requests made, and geographic distribution. Triage in minutes, not hours.

Targeted or Opportunistic? Now You'll Know

When threats hit your industry, the first question is always: are we specifically in the crosshairs, or is this spray-and-pray? Network intelligence lets you track adversary infrastructure across your sector before it reaches your perimeter. See the pattern. Understand the targeting. Brief leadership with confidence because you're no longer guessing. You're showing them the actual traffic patterns that prove whether your organization is in the crosshairs or caught in the spray.

Fraud Infrastructure Exposed

Fraud campaigns depend on infrastructure that moves fast but leaves traces. Your selectors, run against global network intelligence, can reveal the networks behind credential stuffing, account takeover, and payment fraud before the campaign fully scales.

Attribution That Actually Holds Up

Mapping adversary infrastructure is hard. Connecting it to broader campaigns and ultimate operators is harder. Network intelligence gives you the longitudinal visibility to trace how infrastructure evolves, clusters, and connects. Administrative traffic analysis reveals patterns operators use to manage C2 infrastructure. When you identify admin flows from a common source connecting to multiple C2 servers, you're mapping the operator's pattern of life based on observed behavior across hundreds of global vantage points. You're turning indicators into intelligence.

Integration Into Security Workflows

Network intelligence integrates directly into existing security workflows through API access to SIEMs, SOAR platforms, and custom analysis tools. When your SIEM flags suspicious traffic, automated queries reveal global context: Is this IP conducting C2 communications? Scanning your sector specifically? Connected to infrastructure from last month's campaign? Curated threat lists reduce noise from legitimate security research while enabling early blocking of targeted reconnaissance, turning your existing tools into instruments for active investigation rather than passive alerting.

When Expertise Becomes Essential

For organizations facing persistent, sophisticated adversaries, network intelligence capabilities alone aren't sufficient. The difference between having access to global network visibility and operationalizing it effectively comes down to tradecraft.

Recorded Future's Global Network Intelligence Advisory program addresses this by pairing technical capabilities with forward-deployed analysts and embedded engineers who work directly inside your SOC or intelligence fusion center. This becomes especially critical when nation-states are mapping your critical infrastructure, when advanced persistent threats are staging for long-term access, or when attribution could influence strategic decision-making. You need the ability to investigate specific questions with global visibility and the expertise to interpret what you find.

The Compliance Framework That Enables Trust

Network intelligence operates under strict ethical and legal guidelines. All use is subject to our Acceptable Use Policy and must avoid surveillance, profiling of individuals, or political targeting. Access is invitation-only, requiring vetting and agreement to specific terms of use.

These aren't just policies but foundational to how this capability operates. The metadata-only collection model, the data minimization approach, and the geographic distribution that prevents any single point of visibility into user communications are design choices. These constraints aren't obstacles to effectiveness but enablers of trust. They allow powerful intelligence capabilities to exist while maintaining appropriate boundaries.

The gap between what most security programs need and what traditional threat intelligence provides continues to widen. Adversaries operate at scale, evolving infrastructure faster than feeds can update. Internal telemetry shows only what touches your perimeter. Point-in-time observations lack the context to distinguish targeted attacks from noise.

Network intelligence addresses this gap with the ability to query global visibility using your own selectors. At Recorded Future, we've developed capabilities that operate at this scale, with the compliance framework and operational expertise to make them effective. For organizations ready to move beyond pre-packaged feeds, we're offering these capabilities to select customers through an invitation-only program.

What matters now is recognizing that your questions matter more than their answers and building security programs that reflect that reality.

2026 State of Security

Explore the intelligence from Recorded Future's Insikt Group annual threat landscape analysis: the definitive report on how geopolitical fragmentation, state-sponsored operations, and criminal ecosystem evolution are reshaping global risk.

Fragmentation is the new normal

The global threat landscape didn't simplify in 2025—it shattered. Geopolitical alliances strained. Criminal enterprises splintered and regrouped. State-sponsored actors shifted from dramatic disruptions to quiet pre-positioning. And as long-established norms unwound, convergence across once-distinct domains created unprecedented uncertainty.

The 2026 State of Security report delivers Insikt Group's most comprehensive annual analysis of the forces shaping global security—helping leaders reduce surprise, prioritize effectively, and act with confidence.

2025: A year of fragmentation

Geopolitical tensions dominate

Russia-Ukraine War Enters Fourth Year | Geopolitical

India-Pakistan Ballistic Missile Exchanges | Geopolitical

US-Brokered Ceasefire Prevents Escalation | Geopolitical

State-sponsored attacks

Israel-Iran Twelve-Day Conflict | Geopolitical

RedMike Campaign Targets Telecom Infrastructure | State-Sponsored

Chinese Actors Exploit Unpatched Cisco Devices Across 100+ Countries | State-Sponsored

Geopolitical threats and deepfakes

Thailand-Cambodia Border Clashes | Geopolitical

Russian GRU Operations Intensify Against NATO Infrastructure | State-Sponsored

Deepfake-Enabled Fraud Increases 10x Since 2024 | Emerging Technology

289 New Ransomware Variants Identified (33% YoY Increase) | Cybercrime

Synthetic Identity Fraud Up 300% | Emerging Technology

Law Enforcement Disruptions Fragment Criminal Ecosystems | Cybercrime

The converging threat landscape

Risk moves to the edges

China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea focused not on dramatic attacks but on covert accumulation of access—targeting identity systems, cloud environments, and edge infrastructure where oversight is weakest. The primary risk is no longer a single large-scale incident. It's sustained pre-positioning that enables persistent espionage and creates latent capacity for disruption.

Key Insight: Warning timelines are compressing. The adversaries are already inside.

Convergence across domains

Every major conflict in 2025 had a digital front—and the combatants weren't always who they claimed to be. Genuine intrusions, exaggerated claims, and disinformation reinforced one another across Israel-Iran, India-Pakistan, Thailand-Cambodia, and Russia-Ukraine conflicts.

Key Insight: Perception is now contested terrain. Even low-sophistication attacks generate outsized impact when amplified through coordinated information operations.

Fragmented, modular, resilient

Law enforcement achieved significant wins in 2025. But the criminal ecosystem adapted. Sustained pressure fractured large enterprises into smaller, decentralized operations. Groups adopted subscription models, outsourced operations, and relied on specialized services—creating a distributed criminal supply chain that's resilient and difficult to track.

Key Insight: Threat actors are adapting faster than defenses. Modular ecosystems mean even disrupted operations reconstitute rapidly.

Verification failure at scale

2025 was not a breakout year for AI-driven cyber operations. But the immediate risk isn't autonomous attacks—it's verification failure at scale, where deception becomes faster, cheaper, and more convincing. As AI becomes empowered to take real-world actions through autonomous agents, the attack surface for fraud and manipulation will expand dramatically.

Key Insight: Organizations that act now to establish AI governance and prepare for post-quantum migration will hold significant advantages.

[74] Recorded Future - Fragmentation Defined 2025's Threat Landscape. Here's What It Means for 2026

Fragmentation Defined 2025's Threat Landscape. Here's What It Means for 2026

Uncertainty has become the operating environment for business. And this year, fragmentation is driving it.

The global threat landscape didn't simplify in 2025; it shattered. Geopolitical alliances strained. Criminal enterprises splintered under law enforcement pressure, then regrouped into smaller, faster, and harder-to-track operations. State-sponsored cyber actors shifted from dramatic disruptions to quiet pre-positioning, embedding themselves in networks and waiting. Hacktivist groups and influence networks amplified conflicts, blurring the line between genuine intrusions and perception warfare.

But here's what makes this moment dangerous: as long-established norms unwind, fragmentation is paradoxically enabling greater interoperability across domains that were once distinct. State objectives, criminal capability, and private-sector technology increasingly reinforce one another. That convergence creates uncertainty, compresses warning time, and expands plausible deniability.

Today, Recorded Future's Insikt Group releases the 2026 State of Security report, our most comprehensive annual analysis of the forces shaping global security.

Drawing on proprietary intelligence, network telemetry, and deep geopolitical analysis, this report examines how 2025's fractures are reshaping the threat environment — and what security leaders must prepare for in the year ahead.

The End of Stability as a Baseline Assumption

For decades, organizations built risk models around a core premise: that the international order would hold, diplomatic mechanisms would constrain escalation, and major powers would avoid direct confrontation.

That premise no longer applies.

In 2025, the international geopolitical order fragmented as hard-power competition, transactional diplomacy, and the testing of red lines became defining features of state behavior. The Russia–Ukraine war ground into its fourth year, with Moscow maintaining a strategic advantage despite minimal territorial gains. Israel and Iran clashed directly in a twelve-day conflict that reshaped regional power dynamics. India and Pakistan escalated to ballistic missile exchanges before a US-brokered ceasefire intervened. Thailand and Cambodia exchanged fire along disputed borders, triggering the most intense fighting in nearly fifteen years.

The pattern is clear: states are increasingly willing to use force to advance objectives when diplomatic mechanisms appear unreliable. As modern power struggles threaten institutions like international law, risk is spreading across domains that have historically had clearer boundaries.

For organizations, this means geopolitical crises are increasingly likely to spill over into corporate networks, supply chains, regulatory environments, and digital infrastructure with limited warning. Resilience, not stability, became the baseline operating assumption.

State-Sponsored Actors: Risk Moves to the Edges

While kinetic conflicts dominated headlines, some of 2025's most consequential state-sponsored activity unfolded quietly in digital environments — at the edges of networks where oversight is weakest.

China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea, also known as the four most capable and consistently active hostile state cyber actors Insikt Group tracks, focused not on dramatic attacks but on the covert accumulation of access. They targeted identity systems, cloud environments, and edge infrastructure: the poorly monitored network devices, VPN appliances, and perimeter systems that organizations struggle to patch and defend.

Insikt Group's reporting on RedMike highlighted disciplined pre-positioning in telecommunications infrastructure: access built selectively and held quietly for intelligence value by threat actors ready to pivot quickly when timing and pressure align. Chinese state-sponsored actors targeted telecommunications providers worldwide, with one campaign exploiting unpatched Cisco devices across more than 100 countries. Russian GRU-linked groups intensified operations against critical infrastructure in Ukraine and NATO member states. Iranian operators blended espionage with hack-and-leak campaigns. North Korean actors merged revenue generation with espionage, deploying fraudulent IT workers embedded in foreign companies as an access vector.

The strategic shift is profound: the primary risk is no longer a single, large-scale cyber incident. It's sustained pre-positioning that enables persistent espionage in peacetime and creates latent capacity for disruption during crises. Warning timelines are compressing, as the adversaries are already inside.

Hacktivists and Influence Operators: Convergence Across Domains

Every major conflict in 2025 had a digital front, and unsurprisingly, the combatants weren't always who they claimed to be.

Hacktivist groups, patriotic volunteers, and influence networks played growing roles in conflicts involving Israel–Iran, India–Pakistan, Thailand–Cambodia, and Russia–Ukraine. These actors operated with varying degrees of state alignment but consistently contributed to a threat landscape where genuine intrusions, exaggerated claims, and disinformation reinforced one another.

Regional escalation involving Israel and Iran showed how cyber operations, influence campaigns, and commercial surveillance tools can operate alongside military force, as domains converge in ways that would have seemed implausible just years ago. During the India–Pakistan escalation, both sides deployed large-scale influence networks that spread coordinated narratives, forged military documents, and amplified hacktivist claims of grid disruptions. Russian-aligned hacktivists targeted NATO countries with DDoS campaigns, with investigations revealing that portions of this "hacktivist" ecosystem function as state-directed fronts.

The implication for defenders: perception is now contested terrain. Even low-sophistication attacks can generate outsized reputational and psychological impact when amplified through coordinated information operations.

Cybercrime: Fragmented, Modular, Resilient

Law enforcement achieved significant wins against cybercriminal infrastructure in 2025. Forum takedowns, arrests, and sanctions disrupted major operations. Ransomware payments declined for the second consecutive year.

But the criminal ecosystem just adapted to these new conditions.

Sustained pressure fractured large criminal enterprises into smaller, more decentralized operations. Insikt Group identified 289 new ransomware variants this year (a 33% increase from 2024), most of which were derived from leaked source code. Groups adopted subscription models, outsourced operations, and relied on specialized services for laundering and negotiation. The result: a distributed criminal supply chain that's resilient, decentralized, and increasingly difficult to track.

Cybercrime groups increasingly aligned with national strategic objectives, blurring the boundaries between criminal and state activity. In Venezuela, state action eroded legal, political, and cyber boundaries, challenging assumptions about sovereignty and accountability. Mercenary spyware pursued the same persistent-access goals as state actors, embedding where oversight was weakest and adapting under pressure.

English-speaking criminal actors, such as the Scattered LAPSUS$ Hunters collective, demonstrated that low-tech social engineering tactics — particularly help desk impersonation — remain devastatingly effective. Meanwhile, organized crime in Southeast Asia industrialized fraud at an unprecedented scale, with Chinese-speaking transnational criminal organizations running call center compounds using coerced labor augmented by AI-driven automation.

For organizations, the takeaway is stark: threat actors are adapting faster than defenders. Modular criminal ecosystems that share tools, infrastructure, and access can reconstitute rapidly even after disruptions.

Emerging Technologies: Verification Failure at Scale

2025 was not a breakout year for AI-driven cyber operations.

To separate hype from signal, Insikt Group developed AIM3 — our framework for assessing AI malware maturity. It shows that most observed use remains at an early stage of development. Threat actors experimented with malicious AI models tailored for cyber operations, but the results were incremental rather than transformative.

The immediate risk is not autonomous attacks. It's verification failure at scale, where deception becomes faster, cheaper, and more convincing as AI is embedded into decision workflows.

Deepfake-enabled fraud has increased more than tenfold since the start of 2024. Synthetic identity fraud rose 300% in Q1 2025 alone. Adversaries began testing prompt injection attacks and "generated-SEO" manipulation to poison AI search results. As AI becomes empowered to take real-world actions through autonomous agents, the attack surface for fraud and manipulation will expand dramatically.

At the strategic level, the US–China race for AI dominance intensified, with China pursuing an aggressive diffusion strategy that's embedding Chinese LLMs into the global software ecosystem. Competition over quantum computing, advanced robotics, and space systems is extending beyond commercial markets into sustained geopolitical rivalry.

The organizations that act now to establish AI governance, inventory cryptographic dependencies, and prepare for post-quantum migration will hold significant advantages as these technologies mature.

What 2025 Teaches Us About 2026

Looking ahead, diplomatic friction, selective enforcement of norms, and accelerating technology adoption will continue to widen the gap between how risk is assumed to behave and how it actually behaves.

The patterns of 2025 point toward a 2026 threat environment defined by sustained uncertainty:

Simultaneous regional crises will become the norm. As enforcement of established norms becomes more selective, regional and emerging powers will pursue objectives more aggressively, and external intervention in internal conflicts will expand.

Connectivity disruptions will emerge as a primary tool of coercion. Undersea cables, satellite systems, and positioning/navigation/timing infrastructure are becoming strategic targets, with even limited interference capable of cascading across critical sectors.

Ransomware will fragment further. Declining payments will push threat actors toward shorter attack cycles, lower demands, and disruption-focused tactics designed to compel engagement.

The synthetic identity crisis will deepen. AI-enabled deepfakes and compromised identity verification systems will make business email compromise and social engineering more convincing and scalable.

AI will become the next great attack surface. Prompt-based manipulation will increasingly replace code-based exploits as the preferred intrusion method against AI systems.

Quantum readiness will move from planning to spending. Organizations will begin allocating dedicated budgets for cryptographic inventories, vendor transitions, and post-quantum migration pilots.

Robots and space systems will become contested cyber-physical terrain. In 2026, humanoid robots and space infrastructure will move from experimentation to operational deployment, increasing economic and strategic reliance on network-connected cyber-physical systems.

Intelligence does not eliminate uncertainty; having more access to more data points means nothing without context. Rather, intelligence makes the uncertainty more manageable.

Fragmentation creates complexity. But complexity rewards those who can see connections others miss, such as how risks across geopolitics, cyber operations, and criminal ecosystems converge to shape exposure. That's the purpose of the 2026 State of Security report: not just to catalog threats, but to help leaders reduce surprise, prioritize effectively, and act with confidence.

The full report includes detailed analysis of each threat domain, threat actor profiles, regional risk assessments, and actionable recommendations for building organizational resilience.

[75] Recorded Future - From 27 Steps to 5: How Recorded Future Reimagined Threat Hunting with Autonomous Threat Operations

From 27 Steps to 5: How Recorded Future Reimagined Threat Hunting with Autonomous Threat Operations

The manual operations gap can be a business risk

Manual threat hunting requires 27 steps that burn analyst time

Autonomous Threat Operations can reduce 27 steps to 5

Autonomous operations prove measurable ROI

At Recorded Future, we’re constantly looking for ways to help security teams work more efficiently so they can focus their expertise where it matters most: stopping threats before they impact business.

Over the past few years, as we spent time talking to our customers and observing the ways that their SOCs actually work day to day, we discovered a troubling pattern. Every Monday morning, analysts would begin a new round of threat hunts, manually gathering intelligence, writing queries for different tools, correlating findings, and documenting results. By Friday, they’d complete their reports. Meanwhile, attackers who may have breached the network on Tuesday may have already moved laterally, established persistence, and potentially exfiltrated data.

The manual operations gap

This inefficient approach to threat hunting wasn’t a people problem. It was a process problem.

We identified that traditional manual threat hunting required 27 separate steps, from selecting threat actors and gathering intelligence sources to validating anomalies and writing up reports for stakeholders.

Each of the 27 steps consumed hours of analyst time, and the entire manual workflow created what we now call the manual operations gap—the dangerous window between when threats emerge and when security teams can respond.

Rather than accept this gap as an inevitable reality, we asked ourselves a question: How many more threats could be prevented, and how could we improve organizations’ defenses overall, if we could make manual threat operations autonomous?

Rethinking manual workflows

Threat hunting represented the perfect use case for autonomous operations. It’s a critical security function that’s highly repetitive, spans multiple tools, requires constant updates as threats evolve, and must happen continuously—not just during business hours. We knew that if we could bring autonomous functionality to threat hunting, we could demonstrate a new model for security operations.

The breakthrough came from reimagining the entire workflow around a few core principles: intelligence-driven automation, seamless cross-tool orchestration, and continuous autonomous operations. Instead of analysts manually translating intelligence into queries for each security tool, what if their systems could automatically initiate hunts across SIEM, EDR, and other platforms simultaneously? Instead of analysts having to schedule weekly hunt cycles, what if threat hunting could run 24/7, adapting in real time as new intelligence emerged?

The result of this reimagining is Autonomous Threat Operations and the autonomous threat hunting capability, a new solution that reduces 27 manual steps to as few as 5 largely automated ones, delivering the speed, scale, and effectiveness that the modern threat landscape demands.

Closing the gap with autonomous operations

The transition from manual bottlenecks to autonomous operations isn't just about working faster—it's about working smarter. Security teams need workflows that scale their expertise rather than limit it, systems that integrate their existing investments rather than replace them, and processes that prove measurable ROI to justify continued investment.

Organizations that standardize on intelligence-led operations often demonstrate measurable gains in time to detect and time to respond. They can close the gap between threat emergence and defensive action, transforming security from a reactive cost center into a proactive risk-reduction function.

Want to see exactly how leading organizations are making this transformation? Our new playbook breaks down the specific steps for moving from manual threat hunting to autonomous operations—including the precise methodology for reducing complex, multi-day processes into streamlined workflows that run continuously.

Discover how to eliminate workflow bottlenecks, achieve 24/7 threat coverage, and prove the ROI of your security investments in the autonomous era.

Rublevka Team: Anatomy of a Russian Crypto Drainer Operation

Insikt Group has identified a major cybercriminal operation specializing in large-scale cryptocurrency theft, operating under the moniker “Rublevka Team”. Since its inception in 2023, the threat group has generated over $10 million through affiliate-driven wallet draining campaigns. Rublevka Team is an example of a “traffer team,” composed of a network of thousands of social engineering specialists tasked with directing victim traffic to malicious pages. Unlike traditional malware-based approaches such as those used by the traffer teams Marko Polo and CrazyEvil (previously identified by Insikt Group, both of which distributed infostealer malware), Rublevka Team deploys custom JavaScript scripts via spoofed landing pages that impersonate legitimate crypto services, tricking victims into connecting their wallets and authorizing fraudulent transactions. Their infrastructure is fully automated and scalable, offering affiliates access to Telegram bots, landing page generators, evasion features, and support for over 90 wallet types. By lowering the technical barrier to entry, Rublevka Team has built an extensive ecosystem of global affiliates capable of launching high-volume scams with minimal oversight.

This structure poses a growing threat to cryptocurrency platforms, fintech providers, and brands whose identities are being impersonated. Organizations that facilitate blockchain transactions, particularly fintech firms, exchanges, or wallet providers, face elevated reputational and legal risks if customers fall victim to these scams. Even if the victim’s compromise occurs outside a firm’s platform, failure to detect spoofed landing pages or fraudulent referrals can trigger consumer backlash, loss of trust, or regulatory scrutiny around customer protections and Know Your Customer (KYC) enforcement. The threat group’s agility — evidenced by its use of frequently rotating domains, targeting lower-cost chains like Solana (SOL), and exploiting Remote Procedure Call (RPC) APIs — undermines traditional fraud detection and domain takedown efforts. Their model mirrors ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operations, signaling a continuation of the broader shift toward scalable, service-based cybercrime that organizations must proactively monitor, disrupt, and defend against to protect customers and maintain trust.

The objective of a Rublevka Team scam is to create an attractive SOL-based offer, such as a promotion or an airdrop event, generate traffic to the lure via social media or advertisements, and trick a user into connecting their wallet to the website and signing a transaction that drains their wallet.

As of writing, Rublevka Team’s primary Telegram channel has approximately 7,000 members. Over 240,000 messages have been posted to Rublevka Team’s automated “profits” channel, indicating at least 240,000 successful wallet drains, with transactions ranging from $0.16 to over $20,000.

Rublevka Team offers a custom JavaScript drainer embedded into their landing pages, which exfiltrates victims’ SOL assets by draining held tokens. The drainer is compatible with over 90 SOL wallet types.

The threat group’s infrastructure is fully automated via Telegram bots, offering affiliates tools for landing page creation, campaign tracking, cloaking, and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) protection.

The drainer campaign, active since 2023, leverages spoofed versions of legitimate services such as Phantom, Bitget, and Jito to maximize user trust and conversion

Insikt Group has been monitoring Rublevka Team since August 2025, when we first encountered the threat group’s advertisement banner on Exploit Forum. The name “Rublevka Team” is likely a reference to the Rublevka neighborhood of Moscow, a prestigious and wealthy suburb largely populated by elite Russian businesspeople and government officials. Like other traffer teams previously reported by Insikt Group, such as Marko Polo and Crazy Evil, Rublevka Team is a “cryptoscam” team primarily operating on LolzTeam Forum, as well as maintaining a smaller presence on high-tier forums Exploit and XSS. However, in contrast to the traffer teams previously reported by Insikt Group, Rublevka Team does not rely on infostealer malware to target victims; instead, it operates a drainer script embedded in its landing pages to connect to victims’ cryptocurrency wallets and drain their funds.

Based on analysis by Insikt Group, Rublevka Team has been active since 2023, when it was first launched on LolzTeam Forum by the user “denisssss_inactive”. Based on an analysis of its reported profits within its private channel, Rublevka Team has a lifetime revenue of over $10 million USD as of the time of writing. The team’s tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) have evolved since it began operations in 2023. Originally, the threat group operated fake cryptocurrency exchanges to convince users to connect their wallets and deposit funds, focusing on generating traffic through Instagram and, later, TikTok. In 2024, however, Rublevka Team fundamentally shifted its tactics to deploy a custom JavaScript-based cryptocurrency wallet drainer on its landing pages, which impersonated cryptocurrency token airdrops and giveaways. The threat group initially targeted The Open Network (TON), then shifted to SOL in spring 2025. Its latest campaign, which is ongoing as of writing, has generated the majority of its total revenue (approximately $8.2 million).

Rublevka Team Operations

Affiliate Recruitment

Rublevka Team’s latest post on LolzTeam Forum, which was published by denisssss_inactive on April 18, 2025, advertises Rublevka Team’s SOL drainer scam program. Since Rublevka Team’s original postings advertising its cryptocurrency exchange scams and TON token campaigns, the payout rates have shifted significantly in affiliates’ favor, with a starting percentage of 75% and 80% for “experienced users.” The increase in commission rates for starting affiliates may indicate a shift over time in the team’s monetization strategies based on the financial success the threat group has seen; it may now be more favorable to prioritize expanding the pool of workers rather than extracting maximum income from any individual affiliate.

The post also advertises a fully automated Telegram bot for conducting operations, a landing page generator, and free domains and hosting services with included cloaking features and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) protections. The advertisement also describes the SOL drainer used on the landing pages, which supports over 90 wallet types, draining capabilities for SOL, Solana Program Library (SPL) tokens (including SPL2022 extension tokens), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and Native Stake, spoofing and bypass features for Phantom wallet, a drainer API, and over 35 ready-to-use landing pages integrated with the drainer.

The posts do not specify any hard requirements for prospective affiliates, who are instructed to apply for the team via the Telegram bot [@]RublevkaTeam_Bot. Applications are likely vetted by Rublevka Team’s leader, denisssss_inactive, or the administrative team (“Jesse Pinkman” and “Shell” at the time of writing).

Once an applicant is accepted to Rublevka Team, they are directed to join the following private channels:

“[RublevkaTeam] Chat”: Closed group chat with messages dating back to May 2024, with 6,821 members as of writing

“[RublevkaTeam] Info”: An informational channel posting updates to the drainer and affiliate program; the threat group also operates a Russian-language version of this channel, “[Rublevka Team] Инфо”

“[RublevkaTeam] Landing pages”: Repository of screenshots of new landing pages used by Rublevka Team

“RublevkaTeam_bot (@RublevkaTeam_Bot)”: Handles group applications and serves as an administrative panel for affiliate campaigns

“Rublevka Utils (@RublevkaUtils_bot)”: Used for generating custom landing pages and video content for traffic generation

Rublevka Team hosts an informational manual for affiliates on the domain rublevkateam[.]cc. This manual outlines the procedures for working on the team, including how to use the Telegram bot, how to conduct cryptoscams, how to configure the drainer, and more.

The stated goal of the Rublevka Team scam is to create a “drainer-based offer” (usually a promotion, an airdrop notice, a KYC request, or other) and to attract traffic to the website. From the perspective of a victim (referred to as a “lead”), they will encounter the website, connect their cryptocurrency wallet to the website, and then receive an offer to perform a crypto transaction. Upon confirming and signing the transaction, all assets from the lead’s wallet are transferred to the website’s operator.

According to the manual, the team opted for SOL due to its fast transaction time and low fees, as well as its support for smart contracts, decentralized apps (dApps), and NFTs. The manual includes a table of popular wallets that support SOL and are compatible with the Rublevka drainer, which includes Solflare, Phantom, Backpack, Coinbase, Bitget, OKX, Metamask, and others.

Notably, configuration for an affiliate’s campaign is done within the [@]RublevkaTeam_bot, which is available in English, Russian, and Chinese, and in most cases requires no interaction with the support team. This provides affiliates with full control and visibility into their own campaigns.

Rublevka Team affiliates have three options when creating a domain for hosting a landing page:

“Shared domain”: This type of domain is provided by Rublevka Team and is shared among multiple team members. This option is free of charge but has a higher chance of being blocked and comes with a preset list of names. With this option, a user chooses a custom subdomain, which is hosted under a shared apex domain managed by Rublevka Team and periodically rotated by administrators. Users on a shared domain have no control over the IP address of their website. This option has experienced continuous disruptions from December 2025 into 2026.

“Private domain”: An affiliate provides a private domain, which they purchase and configure themselves. This option has minimal risk of being blocked and provides users with full control over their own hosting.

“Self-host”: With this option, the affiliate can host the SOL drainer backend on a Rublevka Team-operated domain for free, with the intent that the affiliate invokes the script from their own privately hosted website.

Users can also choose to register subdomains of their private domain using the bot, with each subdomain functioning as a fully autonomous landing page.

Once a domain is created, the affiliate can configure their landing page. Within the bot, the user has the option to create either a “regular” page, which includes a drainer, or a “white” page, which does not have a drainer and is used to evade abuse detection services. The white pages are used as part of the “Red Table Bypass” feature, designed to unblock a domain that has been blocked by Google by temporarily displaying a harmless web page. In both cases, the user has the option to choose from a wide selection of pre-created landing pages.

Alternatively, users can choose to generate their own landing page based on a template, which can be customized to a token of the user’s choice. They can also choose to “copy” an existing website by providing a URL to the bot; however, as of writing, this functionality appears to be broken.

In addition to generating landing pages, the Telegram bot also allows users to configure “cloaking settings” for their domains. Cloaking is a technique used by cybercriminals that involves presenting website content to a search engine in a way that differs from what the victim will see after navigating to the website. However, Rublevka Team uses the term to describe access restrictions for users from certain countries, IP addresses, internet service providers (ISPs), or virtual private network (VPN) or proxy users. Affiliates can also configure redirect logic and CAPTCHAs via Cloudflare to redirect victims to another landing page if the primary domain is blocked; they can also filter out bots to reduce the likelihood of the domain being blocked. The Telegram bot also supports configurations that allow only the user’s domain to open as a Telegram Mini App for Telegram-based traffic schemes, as well as the option to block specific “leads” (victims).

Rublevka Team affiliates can configure the settings for the drainer to fit their specific needs. The drainer can display a custom fake transaction for receiving SOL or a fake token, based on the contents of an affiliate’s landing page, and can be configured to display a fake credit for each asset drain operation on the wallet. Affiliates can also set up minimum balance alerts to lure victims into buying additional SOL to use on their landing page.

The drainer has additional settings specifically for Phantom wallet, which the manual states is one of the most popular SOL wallets and can allow for a significant boost in “traffic conversion.” The drainer supports the following Phantom wallet “modes,” which are ways to connect with a user’s Phantom wallet to convince a user to sign a malicious drainer transaction:

“Honeypot”: This mode relies on a fake incoming token or SOL receipt to prime the user before initiating a visible drain transaction. The drain is shown as an outgoing transfer, but Phantom does not flag it as risky. Fake receipts only render correctly for tokens installable through Phantom’s UI (not arbitrary custom tokens). A modal window falsely claims that the drained assets will be returned via a second transaction.

“Honeypot2”: Honeypot2 expands on Honeypot by requiring two transactions. The user first sees a fake inbound transfer, then approves a follow-on transaction that performs the drain. When combined with Crasher, the second transaction may appear as a simulation error rather than a clear debit. As with Honeypot, a modal window falsely claims that a refund will follow.

“Fake Return”: Unlike Honeypot, this mode does not simulate inbound funds; instead, it shows a straightforward outgoing transfer that appears legitimate. After a user signs the transaction, a modal window falsely claims that a second “return” transaction will refund the assets.

“Crasher”: This is a stealth-focused drain designed to complete in one interaction with minimal user review. Phantom displays a generic warning commonly seen on legitimate sites, reducing suspicion through familiarity. There is no fake inbound activity or refund narrative. This mode is considered experimental and is replaced by Honeypot behavior on mobile devices.

“Whitelist”: This mode is intended for domains explicitly whitelisted by Phantom, and is used in conjunction with other modes. When active on a whitelisted domain, it enables hidden draining and fake inbound token displays. If enabled on a non-whitelisted domain, Phantom blocks all draining activity, rendering the mode ineffective.

“Warning”: Unlike other modes that suppress warnings, this mode intentionally displays a Phantom warning banner while concealing the drain mechanics, aiming to exploit warning fatigue in users. A modal window instructs the user to proceed despite the warning. Default warnings include:
            
“This dApp could be malicious”
“You are approving over 200 transactions”

“This dApp could be malicious”

“You are approving over 200 transactions”

“Remove Phantom”: This mode restricts Phantom wallet use by hiding it from wallet selectors or blocking connection attempts.

The user can configure notifications in Telegram to notify them when a user visits their website, receives a withdrawal request, does not have funds, and more. Additionally, they can use the “Autosplit” feature, which will send any stolen funds directly to their private wallet, bypassing any intermediaries such as smart contracts or the shared Rublevka Team wallet, which is the default behavior. In this case, the profits are sent as they are, with each drained token being sent without conversion to the threat actor’s wallet.

Additionally, Rublevka Team provides an API (PiterAPI) stored in the piter variable within the JavaScript code to allow more advanced users to further customize drainer behavior. This API includes the following functions:

“connect”: Opens the modal window to connect to a victim’s wallet

“process”: Prompts the user to sign the transaction

“onConnect”: Sets the function to be called when a user connects their wallet

“getBalance,” “getAddress”: Gets victim wallet information

“setToken”: Sets up context for a specific token to be drained, including the token account address, mint, victim address, price, amount, and whether it’s an SPL-2022 token

Landing Pages and Content

Through the Telegram bot, Rublevka Team provides affiliates with an extensive catalog of landing pages available for use in their campaigns. As of October 2025, the Insikt Group identified 50 unique drainer landing pages and eleven “white” landing pages provided to affiliates. It is possible that additional landing pages have been added to the Telegram bot since then.

The drainer landing pages spoofed meme coin and stablecoin token airdrops, token mints, decentralized finance (DeFi) trading platforms, SOL staking services, and more. For the most part, the landing pages impersonate existing “legitimate” services, such as Axiom, Bitget, Photon, Jito, and Marinade. The landing pages also impersonate existing meme coin and social coin tokens for airdrops, including “Bonk,” “DogWifHat,” “Trump,” “Pengu,” and “Fartcoin.” The SOL-specific services pages typically reference SOL liquid staking, “burning” or “incineration,” faucets, airdrops, snipers, and multipliers. Generally, the landing pages included social media and informational links to the actual websites of the coins and services they were impersonating, likely to appear legitimate in a cursory check.

The landing page generator also included a panel for selecting a crypto wallet to connect to the malicious page, which prompts users to either connect an existing wallet or create a new one.

It is likely that these landing pages are used to lure victims to connect their wallet to the website, after which the embedded drainer script, index.js, will enumerate the wallet’s holdings, trick the user into signing a malicious transaction, and drain all held funds.

JavaScript Drainer Analysis

Based on Insikt Group’s analysis of the malicious landing pages, we identified that each page contained the file index.js (9c21d538c2a556f4a5b351b29f3513097ac57643f291ff6d751400d8dbc69489). This file is heavily obfuscated; Insikt Group assesses that the authors possibly used js-confuser, a free open-source JavaScript obfuscation tool with no available deobfuscator. However, Insikt Group was still able to identify strings of interest within the code, including indicators that may suggest parts of the script’s functionality.

The drainer includes the following URLs:

hxxps://mainnet[.]helius-rpc[.]com/?api-key=

hxxps://mainnet[.]helius-rpc[.]com/?api-key=8e0e9a34-2648-421a-8f22-6460b4a68705

hxxps://solana-rpc[.]publicnode[.]com

hxxps://wallet-api[.]solflare[.]com

These are likely authorization calls to the Solana remote procedure call (RPC) API endpoints provided by RPC platforms Helius and WalletConnect, as well as the free Solana RPC endpoint provided by PublicNode. These endpoints are likely used to conduct the malicious drainer transactions. Notably, the Helius and WalletConnect URLs include API keys, as both services require sign-up and have various service tiers. As such, these API keys likely belong to Rublevka Team developers. The Solflare endpoint is likely used to connect to a victim’s wallet for enumeration and draining. The strings also included the domain efficient-endpoint[.]site (discussed further in the Domains and Infrastructure section below).

The drainer code also includes the following strings (verbatim):

Insikt Group also identified approximately 160 unique strings within the drainer that resembled SOL addresses. Of these, approximately 30 corresponded to known addresses in the SOL ecosystem, including system programs and token mints. The remaining approximately 130 addresses do not have any official SOL affiliation and are likely private addresses linked to attacker infrastructure. These addresses are discussed further in the Cryptocurrency Addresses section below.

Profits and Top Earners

According to the main chat channel, Rublevka Team has also operated a more private channel for “top earners” to receive “exclusive” information and landing pages. As of May 2025, the eligibility requirements for this channel are:

Having no less than ten TON in profit (the team was targeting TON during this time)

Being in the list of top 50 earners in the last ten days, which can be verified using a command in the [@]RublevkaTeam_bot

Being active in the team for no less than fourteen days, including providing traffic, contributing to the chat channel, or communicating with members of the support team

Having any Telegram username

Although a high number (approximately 14%) of “worker” names are hidden in the channel messages, Insikt Group was able to identify the top named earners in Rublevka Team based on the number of transactions posted to the channel, as well as based on the highest revenue per individual. The worker named “🇨🇦🇹🇷🇮🇷🇪🇪🇪🇺🇫🇮🇫🇷🇩🇪🇯🇵🇳🇱🇰🇷🇺🇸”, for example, has a total of 24,625 posts in the profits channel, the most among any other individual user, and has grossed $292,033.85 USD during their time in Rublevka Team. Other top posters include “Zatecky Gus 🍎🩸🍎🩸🍎🩸🍎🩸🍎🩸🍎🩸🍎” (9,804 posts valued at $95,106.91), “🍎🦮💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥👀” (8,165 posts valued at $76,228.84), and others.

The top earner per the profits channel is the user “hard working guy”; though there are only 799 transactions associated with this user, they are valued at over $1.3 million. Multiple users within the “[RublevkaTeam] Chat” channel expressed amazement at this user’s high profits, with several users asking “hard working guy” to message them for collaboration and speculating on what type of traffic “hard working guy” uses to generate such high profits per transaction. However, “hard working guy” is not active within the chat channel, and several users have cast doubt on whether this user exists, or if they are a fake user created by Rublevka Team administrators to motivate other affiliates to “work harder.” The user “think about it” is a close second to “hard working guy”, with 145 transactions valued at $1.04 million. The next top earner, “Mr. Zelensky” (no relation to the President of Ukraine), made only $325,662.67 with 195 transactions, indicating a significant gradation between these earning tiers. This likely demonstrates the differing approaches between individual affiliates of Rublevka Team, which involve either extracting small sums of money from individual victims over a prolonged period or draining large quantities in fewer transactions.

Domains and Infrastructure

Insikt Group collected a sample of domains associated with Rublevka Team based on the Telegram bot and channels linked to the threat group. Based on proprietary sources, it is evident that Rublevka Team is constantly changing and rotating their infrastructure, including the domains used to host their shared pages for affiliate use, as well as other staging infrastructure to host aspects of their drainer. Over the last year, shared Rublevka Team domains have included:

Using open-source intelligence (OSINT) tools, Insikt Group identified approximately 70 unique subdomains historically associated with open-sol[.]cc, 400 associated with sol-hook[.]org, 300 associated with sol-galaxy[.]cc, 30 associated with web-core[.]cc, and 40 associated with sol-coin[.]xyz, as of writing. A cursory analysis of these domains’ hosting information showed that Rublevka Team primarily hides their shared infrastructure behind Cloudflare, with variation in registrars (using CNOBIN, Public Domain Registry, and an unspecified Hong Kong-based registrar). Notably, in November and December 2025, three of the domains (sol-galaxy[.]cc, web-core[.]cc, and sol-coin[.]xyz) migrated to IP address 158[.]94[.]208[.]165, registered to “Lanedonet Datacenter,” previously named “Metaspinner Net Gmbh.” Insikt Group recently identified Metaspinner net GmbH as a fraudulently registered hosting network that impersonated a legitimate German software company. Following RIPE NCC intervention, the network was re-registered under Lanedonet Datacenter. Insikt Group assessed with high confidence that Lanedonet Datacenter is operated by threat activity enabler (TAE) Virtualine Technologies.

Insikt Group also identified several domains used for Rublevka Team’s shared drainer backend hosting (“selfhost”) service: g-app-d[.]cc, fontmaxplugin[.]cc, and commontechrepo[.]cc. These domains are also behind Cloudflare and have obfuscated registration information. We identified approximately 60 unique subdomains under g-app-d[.]cc, approximately 20 under fontmaxplugin[.]cc, and approximately 40 under commontechrepo[.]cc, all of which followed the naming convention “[word1]-[word2].[domain].cc,” where “word1” and “word2” appeared to be randomly selected words. This is likely due to the specific domain generation algorithm (DGA) used by Rublevka Team to automatically spin up domains as they rotate them.

Insikt Group also identified the domain efficient-endpoint[.]site contained within the drainer file index.js. This domain was registered on September 24, 2025, and was hosted behind Cloudflare until December 12, 2025. After this date, the WHOIS record indicated it was registered via Namecheap to “Alexander Petrov,” with a physical address at 742 Evergreen Drive, Springfield, OR (likely fake), and the email address alex[.]petrov[.]domain[@]emailsecure[.]tech.

Insikt Group identified additional domains registered to this individual and email address, with over 900 registered since April 2025. These subdomains followed several DGA patterns since first being registered, including “[word 1]-[word 2]-[word 3]” and “[word 1][word 2][word 3]” (where each word is themed around decentralized finance and technology), “[word 1][word 2]”, and “[word 1]-[word 2]”. They used the top-level domains .xyz, .online, .site, .store, .space, .online, and .com.

The first website observed in OSINT sources registered to the email address alex[.]petrov[.]domain[@]emailsecure[.]tech is burn-shard-bridge[.]xyz, first observed on April 15, 2025. Around this time, the website displayed a “Connect Wallet” window similar to that observed in the Rublevka Team landing page generator, and an analysis of calls made by the website included /piter/visit and /piter/fetch, matching the name of the “Piter” drainer API described in Rublevka Team’s manual. We identified the following five additional domains that shared similar features and were registered to the same email address:

public-proof[.]online

highperformance-kit[.]online

instant-automated-matrix[.]website

highperformance-shard[.]online

All of these websites demonstrated similar behavior, including displaying the same “Connect Wallet” window, calls to the PiterAPI function openModal(), and references to a JavaScript file that is highly similar to the drainer analyzed by Insikt Group. Hashes for the JavaScript drainer files observed on these websites are included in Appendix A.

We assess that the domains registered to Alexander Petrov are possibly automatically generated infrastructure for use by Rublevka Team to host backend functions of their drainer operation, where the high volume of the domains is likely intended to enable the threat group to frequently rotate their infrastructure.

Cryptocurrency Addresses

Insikt Group identified a set of cryptocurrency addresses connected to Rublevka Team operations. Approximately 160 unique strings resembling SOL addresses were extracted from the JavaScript drainer attached to the team’s malicious landing pages, and several others were obtained by tracing transactions within affiliate screenshots showing proof of their payouts on forums and the “[RublevkaTeam] Chat” Telegram channel. We focused on the following addresses for further analysis:

EAsyxEjYKbDSVi6JbGYF1v9Jq1QyTSghRc8aqCeq7Ub3 (“Address A”, Transaction History)

EkaGjTVHDiRTYqSiup6TQs2QXfqSnEcrWN61dC8UVK21 (“Address B”, Transaction History)

CRnuwdpi3HGvFU5gGnvZAA9rV7AWe12v3sap8H3vXFY4 (“Address C”, Transaction History)

DD6vCVa4NEYRKA7K93rYZSKuY7REydFbqB3rog149ySx (“Address D”, Transaction History)

8e8kiGgEMCxYYx2vuSf2iPo859QjE7ojkY6yGWDez9pW (“Address E”, Transaction History)

4Ri6Rd7zN6M6H8jF3vPc6MqnmFioVcPaizZt3crLVGXd (“Address F”, Transaction History)

Insikt Group identified seventeen references to the above addresses in the Recorded Future Platform, all of which involved posts from users on social media and Telegram stating that those addresses had stolen crypto assets from them, with the earliest post dated July 10, 2025. One such post specifically named pumptoken[.]net as the phishing website that had initiated the transaction; via further historical analysis, Insikt Group identified a JavaScript file linked to this website (b9157f6bff6a6ee6ba5932ebac2c8796836b21eb3c69df08fbeb102e9228ba15) that had a high degree of similarity with the drainer file analyzed above, including the same obfuscation technique and overlap in listed addresses. We assess that these users were likely victims of Rublevka Team.

Both Address A and Address B were contained in the JavaScript drainer code as base64-encoded strings, indicating an attempt by the threat actor to further obfuscate these specific addresses, while all others were available in plaintext. Based on SOL blockchain data, Address A is listed as the “owner” for 31 of the identified addresses within the drainer JavaScript file, corresponding to its Associated Token Accounts (ATAs). As such, these ATAs are almost certainly used as part of the drainer logic. Additionally, the address appeared to be making a high number of conversions to wrapped SOL (wSOL), potentially to use on or swap to compatible blockchains. Insikt Group observed that in fall 2025, Address A followed a pattern of transferring large amounts in and out on the same day, with $50,000 to $80,000 moving through the wallet each day over a several-week period. On October 6, 2025, approximately $1.2 million worth of assets were transferred in and out of the address. This pattern suggests that the wallet was likely used by Rublevka Team as a conduit for transferring and laundering stolen funds before cashing them out. Based on SOL blockchain data, the address first came into use in September 2025.

Insikt Group also identified an account associated with Address A on pump[.]fun, a platform for users to launch their own meme coins. This account holds low balances in over 600 tokens and was first funded by a transaction from Fixed Float Exchange on September 22, 2025.

The account associated with Address B currently holds over 100 tokens and is associated with a high volume of token swap activity. Notably, Address B’s first funder is Address C, which was mentioned in several social media posts as a malicious wallet between July and August 2025. It was also mentioned in a Reddit thread from August 2025, where users discussed having their funds stolen. One user stated that they were signing up for Axiom and connected their Phantom wallet to the service website, and once they authenticated the service took $50 worth of SOL from their wallet and transferred it to Address C. Based on the wallet address and TTPs (using an Axiom-themed landing page and Phantom wallet), we assess that this individual was likely another victim of Rublevka Team.

Insikt Group identified Addresses D and E in several affiliate reviews of Rublevka Team, namely in posts showing proof of funds disbursement to their personal wallets from those addresses. These addresses also appeared in screenshots of the [@]RublevkaTeam_bot “profits” notifications, posted by individual affiliates to the chat channel, many of which did not obfuscate the victim wallet ID, allowing Insikt Group to trace the transaction. Several of these transactions were made directly to Address D and E. Based on this, we assess that these are likely two of the “shared” Rublevka addresses used to collect stolen assets and then disburse affiliates’ cuts. We also note that Address E is the first funder of Address D.

In addition to the above, Insikt Group identified 28 abuse reports for SOL addresses contained in the drainer file (including Addresses A to E) within other open sources, made between April and October 2025. Users reported a variety of scams in which these addresses drained their funds. These scams involved web pages shared on Telegram, social media, and crypto investment advice groups that prompted users to connect their wallets and sign transactions, resulting in the loss of all their funds. The TTPs and timeframe described in these reports match those associated with Rublevka Team, and we assess that these reports were highly likely made by Rublevka Team victims. Notably, in at least one report, users reported that in addition to their wallet funds being drained, they experienced a breach of their personal data and accounts; this may indicate that some Rublevka Team affiliates possibly conduct additional follow-on activity as part of their scams, such as credential theft. For a full list of the domains and malicious social media accounts listed in these reports, see Appendix C.

A complete list of SOL addresses extracted from the drainer script can be found in Appendix D; this section excludes addresses corresponding to SOL system programs and official token mints.

Rublevka Team represents the maturation of cybercrime-as-a-service within the cryptocurrency threat landscape, signaling that sophisticated social engineering and scalable infrastructure now rival malware as the primary tool set for digital asset theft. As this affiliate-driven drainer ecosystem continues to expand, we expect similar models to proliferate across other blockchain ecosystems and decentralized platforms, particularly those with low transaction fees and fast settlement times, such as SOL. The low barrier to entry, combined with high financial incentives, will continue to attract a global pool of cybercriminals, accelerating the volume, complexity, and geographic diversity of crypto-targeted scams in the near term.

Looking ahead, brand impersonation campaigns tied to crypto drainers will become a strategic reputational risk for exchanges, Web3 platforms, and fintech providers. The effectiveness of these spoofing campaigns, especially those that mimic legitimate token airdrops or DeFi services, will continue to erode user trust in the broader crypto ecosystem. As threat actors like Rublevka Team improve their social engineering tactics, abuse of RPC APIs, and cloaking techniques to bypass detection, more platforms will likely come under regulatory pressure to implement proactive monitoring, takedown partnerships, and user verification mechanisms to mitigate liability.

Autonomous Threat Operations in action: Real results from Recorded Future’s own SOC team

Recorded Future deployed Autonomous Threat Operations within its own SOC before customer release, ensuring real-world effectiveness and identifying critical capabilities.

Autonomous Threat Operations reduced analyst-dependent, inconsistent processes, creating standardized hunts that deliver the same input, output, and expectations every time.

Team members now run 15-20 threat hunts weekly—work that previously required days or weeks of manual research, coordination, and planning.

During the Salt Typhoon campaign, Recorded Future's CISO launched a comprehensive network-wide threat hunt in five minutes between meetings, enabling immediate risk mitigation.

A single pane of glass eliminates context-switching across multiple tools, allowing analysts to hunt threats and research IOCs within one platform.

Autonomous Threat Operations in action: Real results from Recorded Future’s own SOC team

The ultimate test of any cybersecurity solution Recorded Future builds? Using it to defend our own network.

That's exactly what we did with Autonomous Threat Operations. Before rolling it out to customers, we became Customer Zero, deploying the technology within our security operations organization to see if it could truly transform the way security teams hunt for threats.

The results exceeded our expectations. What we discovered wasn't just incremental improvement; it was a fundamental shift in what our security team could accomplish.

The challenge: Inconsistent and analyst-dependent threat hunting

Prior to implementing Autonomous Threat Operations, we faced the same threat hunting challenges many security teams struggle with today. As Josh Gallion, Recorded Future's Incident Response Manager, explains: "Before using Autonomous Threat Operations, our approach to threat hunting was more piecemeal and unique to each analyst. It varied based on whatever they were comfortable with and however they were trained on the tooling."

This inconsistency meant that the quality and thoroughness of our threat hunts varied significantly by analyst. And since each team member had different strengths, different levels of experience, and different comfort levels with our security tools, we struggled to standardize the process.

The transformation: Unified, repeatable threat hunting

Autonomous Threat Operations leveled the playing field immediately. "It unifies the hunting capability and makes it so that every time analysts run a hunt, it's the same," says Gallion. "We get the same input, we get the same output, and we know what to expect."

The implementation was remarkably straightforward. "When we turned it on, it just was a simple connection to our Splunk environment," he says. "And once the team started using it, we could see an increase in the number of threat hunts each user would do."

Perhaps most importantly, Autonomous Threat Operations enabled our team to shift from reactive, manual hunting to proactive, automated operations. "Now we can schedule hunts that will continuously run over time, update with the threat actor TTPs, and give us a more holistic view," Gallion says. "Before, we had to have an analyst get back into the product and look for new IOCs to run. Now it just runs it automatically and we know that that's taken care of."

Real-world impact: Upskilling junior analysts and enabling rapid response

According to Recorded Future's CISO, Jason Steer, the true value of Autonomous Threat Operations became clear through two significant outcomes.

First, the technology dramatically upskilled our junior staff. In traditional manual workflows, preparing to run a single threat hunt could take days or even weeks—requiring extensive research, coordination, and planning.

Today, our junior analysts are running 15–20 threat hunts each week to identify high-priority threats. This isn't just about quantity; it's about empowering less experienced team members to contribute meaningfully to our defense posture while accelerating their professional development.

Gallion sees this impact firsthand. "We have newer analysts who can do more advanced hunting based on IOCs, and it does it for them automatically in the background,” he says. “We get our results, and then they can do research in the app to shore up the findings."

Second, the speed and accessibility of automated threat hunting has proven invaluable during critical moments. When Steer read about Salt Typhoon making its way into corporate networks, he didn't need to schedule a meeting, assemble a team, or wait for the next sprint cycle. In the five minutes between meetings, he was able to launch a comprehensive threat hunt across Recorded Future's entire network to identify and mitigate associated risks to our systems.

That kind of rapid response would have been impossible with manual processes—and in today's threat landscape, that speed can mean the difference between containment and catastrophe.

The advantage of a single pane of glass

Another key benefit emerged around workflow efficiency. "Having a single pane of glass makes it a lot easier for an analyst to do not just the threat hunt, but also to see the meaning behind the IOCs that they're pulling back into the app," says Gallion. "Analysts don't like to have to get into a whole bunch of different applications. If we don't have to, it speeds things up and we can add context from inside the app."

This unified approach has eliminated the context-switching and tool-juggling that had often slowed down our security team and led to missed findings.

Why the Customer Zero experience matters

Serving as Customer Zero validated what we believed Autonomous Threat Operations could deliver to every customer: consistent, repeatable threat hunting that empowers analysts of all skill levels to defend their organizations more effectively. By testing the new solution within our own security operations first, we were able to identify what works, refine the capabilities that matter most, and prove that Autonomous Threat Operations isn't just a theoretical improvement—it's a practical solution that transforms daily security operations.

Gallion sums it up this way: "Some of the aspects of Autonomous Threat Operations that'll have the biggest impact are the repeatability, the scheduling of threat hunts to happen over time, and the single pane of glass that allows analysts to research IOCs in the app without having to go into multiple tools."

We saw a need for Autonomous Threat Operations, so we built it. Being Customer Zero enabled us to test it, refine it, and ensure that it’s the best possible solution to help our customers enter the era of the autonomous SOC.

[78] Recorded Future - PurpleBravo’s Targeting of the IT Software Supply Chain

PurpleBravo’s Targeting of the IT Software Supply Chain

PurpleBravo is a North Korean state-sponsored threat group that overlaps with the “Contagious Interview” campaign first documented in November 2023. It targets software developers, especially in the software development and cryptocurrency verticals, via fake recruiter outreach, interview coding tests, and ClickFix prompts. Activity throughout 2025 has linked multiple fraudulent LinkedIn personas to PurpleBravo through malicious GitHub repositories and fictitious lure brands. The group’s tool set includes BeaverTail (a JavaScript infostealer and loader) and multi-platform remote access trojans (RATs), specifically, PyLangGhost and GolangGhost, optimized for stealing browser credentials and cryptocurrency wallet information.

Based on Recorded Future® Network Intelligence, Insikt Group identified 3,136 individual IP addresses concentrated in South Asia and North America linked to likely targets of PurpleBravo activity from August 2024 to September 2025. Twenty potential victim organizations were observed across the AI, cryptocurrency, financial services, IT services, marketing, and software development verticals in Europe, South Asia, the Middle East, and Central America. In several cases, it is likely that job-seeking candidates executed malicious code on corporate devices, creating organizational exposure beyond the individual target. Insikt Group observed PurpleBravo administering command-and-control (C2) servers via Astrill VPN and from IP ranges in China, with BeaverTail and GolangGhost C2 servers hosted across seventeen distinct providers.

Insikt Group distinguishes PurpleBravo (Contagious Interview) from PurpleDelta (North Korean IT workers) but has documented meaningful intersections. This includes a likely PurpleBravo operator displaying activity consistent with North Korean IT worker behavior, IP addresses in Russia linked to North Korean IT workers communicating with PurpleBravo C2 servers, and administration traffic from the same Astrill VPN IP address associated with PurpleDelta activity.

PurpleBravo presents an overlooked threat to the IT software supply chain. Because many targets are in the IT services and staff-augmentation industries with large public customer bases, compromises can propagate downstream to their customers. This campaign poses an acute software supply-chain risk to organizations that outsource development, particularly in regions where PurpleBravo concentrates its fictitious recruitment efforts.

PurpleBravo employs a combination of fictitious personas, organizations, and websites to distribute malware to unsuspecting job seekers in the software development industry. Candidates sometimes use their corporate devices, thereby compromising their employers' security.

PurpleBravo uses a variety of custom and open-source malware and tools in its operations, including BeaverTail, InvisibleFerret, GolangGhost, and PylangGhost.

Using Recorded Future Network Intelligence, Insikt Group identified 3,136 individual IP addresses linked to likely targets of PurpleBravo activity and twenty potential victim organizations in the AI, cryptocurrency, financial services, IT services, marketing, and software development industries.

Insikt Group has observed multiple points of overlap between PurpleBravo and PurpleDelta, Recorded Future’s designation for North Korean IT workers, indicating that some individuals may be active in both operations.

PurpleBravo’s heavy targeting of the IT and software development industries in South Asia presents an overlooked and acute supply-chain risk to organizations that contract or outsource their IT services work.

The Contagious Interview campaign, a North Korean state-sponsored operation, was first documented in November 2023 targeting software developers primarily in the cryptocurrency industry. Insikt Group tracks PurpleBravo as a cluster of activity overlapping with the campaign (other names for the group include CL-STA-0240, Famous Chollima, and Tenacious Pungsan). While some organizations track the Contagious Interview cluster and North Korean IT workers as the same set of activity, Insikt Group tracks North Korean IT workers separately as PurpleDelta. Insikt Group has observed points of intersection between the two groups and is investigating the exact extent of the overlap.

In March 2025, Insikt Group identified four personas (Figure 1) that were highly likely associated with PurpleBravo threat activity. This high-confidence assessment was made following an investigation of malicious GitHub repositories, cryptocurrency scam reports on social media, and Recorded Future Network Intelligence on known PurpleBravo infrastructure. These personas, and their associated behaviors, align with previous Insikt Group reporting and open-source reporting (1, 2, 3) on the Contagious Interview campaign.

The personas claim to be developers and recruiters representing cryptocurrency companies, among other types of organizations. These organizations appear in the PurpleBravo lures and malicious GitHub repositories detailed below. They all purport to be from Odessa, Ukraine, and target prospective victims located in South Asia. At the time of writing, Insikt Group was unable to determine the motivation behind PurpleBravo's use of Ukrainian personas in their operations.

Insikt Group identified several malicious GitHub repositories linked to PurpleBravo activity, via publicly available information on potential victim servers outlined in Recorded Future’s Network Intelligence data.

Insikt Group identified a GitHub repository linked to Web3 security researcher Luthiano Trarbach, who reported an unattributed scam impersonating a food manufacturing brand with the goal of cryptocurrency theft. Insikt Group identified a website advertising a token the repository is likely imitating. It is assessed with low confidence that the token is likely a scam, based on an evaluation of the social media and messaging platform activity associated with its operators and users. At the time of writing, the project's legitimacy could not be determined, nor could any links between the token and the food manufacturing brand identified. The “official” Telegram group associated with the project is populated with scammers, bots, malicious links, and likely malicious downloads masquerading as job opportunities, cryptocurrency airdrops, and other lures generally indicative of this behavior.

The repository contains a JavaScript file named index[.]js. This file is encoded in Base64 with an XOR cipher, which, when deobfuscated, reveals malicious capabilities intended to exfiltrate sensitive keychain and login information from Windows OS and macOS devices. This data is packaged into a ZIP file and sent to a hardcoded command-and-control (C2) server with an encoded HTTP POST request (Figure 2). When the string MTQ3LjEyNCaHR0cDovLw4yMTQuMTI5OjEyNDQ is decoded from Base64, it reveals a previously identified BeaverTail C2 IP address 147[.]124[.]214[.]129.

Figure 2: HTTP POST instructions identified in the GitHub repository (Source: GitHub)

ESET’s February 2025 report on threat activity aligned with PurpleBravo (which ESET tracks as DeceptiveDevelopment) described PurpleBravo threat actors posing as recruiters using a Lumanagi-themed lure in fake job interviews for a decentralized exchange (DEX) to deliver BeaverTail via malicious GitHub repositories. Insikt Group searched for additional GitHub repositories containing the same malicious JavaScript strings identified in the ESET report, revealing a repository affecting an Indian software development company. This repository contains a malicious JavaScript file titled routes.js, which is heavily obfuscated and different from the food manufacturing token’s instance. The JavaScript in the software development company’s repository had two further BeaverTail C2 servers hard-coded IP addresses, 216[.]173[.]115[.]200 and 95[.]179[.]135[.]133.

While investigating the Indian software development company’s repository and the “Lumanagi” lure previously observed in the ESET report, Insikt Group identified a scam report on social media on or around March 28, 2025. This scam report claimed that a recruiter (“Karyna Isakova”; Figure 1) representing Lumanagi approached a South Asian developer for a job opportunity. The PurpleBravo operator posing as the recruiter sent a document via Google Docs purportedly from lumanagi[.]online that contained information about their project, the job vacancy, and the next steps for a practical interview. This document contained a Figma design for a Hungarian-language DEX named Lumanagi. This behavior aligns with previous reports on PurpleBravo’s interview lures, which incorporate Google Docs and Figma into their activities.

Insikt Group identified a third malicious GitHub repository linked to one of the abovementioned personas. This repository contained a similar malicious file to routes[.]js, which was observed in the Indian software development company’s repository. When the JavaScript in this file is deobfuscated, it reveals the BeaverTail C2 IP addresses, 216[.]173[.]115[.]200 and 95[.]179[.]135[.]133. Revisiting the persona on LinkedIn revealed that the persona previously claimed to work for Lumanagi, linking this persona back to the PurpleBravo network.

Recorded Future tracks two distinct sets of PurpleBravo C2 servers, BeaverTail and GolangGhost. BeaverTail is a JavaScript infostealer and loader that gathers sensitive information from victim systems, and GolangGhost is an interpreted Go backdoor based on the HackBrowserData open-source tool. Recorded Future identified 62 BeaverTail C2 servers and fourteen GolangGhost C2 servers between August 2024 and September 2025. The hosting providers detailed in Figure 3 have been used by PurpleBravo to host C2 infrastructure.

Figure 3: Hosting providers used by PurpleBravo (Source: Recorded Future)

Both families are organized into parallel components:

Core/Control loop: Implements the persistent request–response cycle, serializes messages for C2, and dispatches received commands

Command layer: Encodes/decodes the line‑based Base64 message format and contains the code to execute the commands

Transport/Protocol: Performs RC4 wrapping with a per-packet random key, followed by an MD5 checksum; the HTTP POST body uses the application/octet-stream MIME type; and its observed User‑Agent strings include python-requests and Go-http-client

Utilities: TAR/GZIP pack/unpack for staging exfiltration

Configuration: Fixed message/command identifiers and AUTO mode tokens; jitter and PID/machine‑id filenames; Windows persistence keys and parameterization

Table 1 details the commands that PylangGhost and GolangGhost support.

Table 1: PylangGhost and GolangGhost commands and descriptions (Source: Recorded Future)

GolangGhost and PylangGhost both have a Chromium Stealer module that is invoked with the “AUTO” command; however, the implementation differs across versions. PylangGhost focuses exclusively on Windows Chromium but implements far more sophisticated credential theft, supporting both v10 and v20 app-bound encryption. The latter requires LSASS impersonation to achieve SYSTEM privileges, dual-layer DPAPI unwrapping, and custom key derivation via Windows CNG APIs to bypass Chrome's hardened encryption introduced in version 127 and later.

GolangGhost, on the other hand, only implements Chrome v10 decryption using standard AES-GCM after obtaining master keys from native credential stores. It compensates for this simpler decryption by automating the enumeration of extensions to catalog cryptocurrency wallets at scale. GolangGhost's design suggests optimization for broader victim coverage across multiple platforms, such as macOS and Linux, while PylangGhost represents a specialized Windows-focused variant engineered specifically to defeat Google's latest credential protection mechanisms, making it more effective against hardened Chrome installations but limited to a single OS.

The configuration for PylangGhost (config.py) and GolangGhost (constans.go) serves as the central configuration and command vocabulary file for the C2. It contains tokens that are obfuscated command identifiers used to obscure the communication protocol between the infected client and the command-and-control server. Instead of sending readable commands like "download" or "execute", it uses random-looking strings, such as "qwer" or "asdf".

Figure 4: PylangGhost configuration snippet (Source: Recorded Future)

The malware manages its runtime state and host identity using two files defined in the configuration module, PID0187NAME and MACHINEID0187HOSTFILE, as shown in Figure 4. These files are created in the system’s temporary directory (for example, %TEMP% on Windows). The .store (PID0187NAME) file records the process identifier (PID) of the active instance and is checked during startup to prevent multiple concurrent executions. The file .host (MACHINEID0187HOSTFILE) contains a randomly generated, persistent client identifier.

The configuration also contains C2 endpoints, persistence registry keys, collection scope, and instance control across both variants. It supplies the C2 URL and a list of Chromium wallet-extension IDs targeted by the Chrome “auto” modes.

Figure 5: PylangGhost configuration snippet (Source: Recorded Future)

On Windows systems, the malware achieves persistence by creating a registry Run key that launches a Visual Basic Script (VBS) loader via wscript.exe. Both the registry path and key name are hardcoded in the malware’s configuration module. For example, using the configuration in Figure 5, the persistence key would be

HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\csshost = "wscript.exe" "<VBS file path>".

Key names may change from configuration to configuration, and some constants carry variant-specific suffixes (for example, _0187, _0501); however, their semantics and use in persistence, collection, and protocol handling remain the same.

PylangGhost and GolangGhost both send an RC4-encrypted payload via an HTTP POST request with headers such as application/octet-stream and typical User Agents of python-requests (Py) and Go-http-client (Go).

Figure 6: PylangGhost and GolangGhost HTTP POST request (Source: Recorded Future)

The HTTP payloads are RC4-encrypted. The start of the payload is a 16-byte MD5 value calculated over everything that follows: first, a randomly generated RC4 key (sent in the clear) and then the RC4‑encrypted message body. Because the key is included up front, anyone with the packet capture can decrypt the body; the MD5 can be used to confirm that the packet was split correctly and that the contents were not corrupted. The length of the RC4 key is chosen at build time and is not recorded in the packet itself. Insikt Group has observed that this is consistently 128 bytes.

Figure 7: PylangGhost and GolangGhost custom RC4 Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) (Source: Recorded Future)

After RC4 decryption, the payload is just a single text line made of “tokens” separated by spaces. Each token is Base64 encoded. For messages going from the victim to the command-and-control server, the first token is a plain machine ID (not Base64 encoded), followed by a Base64‑encoded message type (for example, the four‑character code fwe9 for “system info”) and several Base64‑encoded fields such as user name, computer name, operating system, architecture, and an internal version string.

Figure 8: PylangGhost and GolangGhost request Base64 encode and decode (Source: Recorded Future)

For messages sent from the server to the victim, every token is Base64-encoded; the first one decodes to a four‑character command (for example, r4ys for the “auto” task), and the remaining tokens provide that command’s arguments.

InvisibleFerret is a Python-based, multi-platform RAT incorporating modular functionality for system control, credential theft, and data exfiltration. The malware operates through two C2 channels: a persistent, custom TCP command channel and an HTTP service leveraged for initial host fingerprinting, payload staging, and file exfiltration. Newer builds appear protected by the use of PyObfuscate or OSRipper tooling.

InvisibleFerret consists of three primary components:

The core RAT, built for cross-platform operation, conducts system reconnaissance and maintains a persistent C2 session using length-prefixed JSON messages. It supports capabilities such as remote shell execution, file search and download, collection of environment configuration files, browser-process termination, and on-demand staging of additional payloads.

The Windows keylogger uses Python libraries, including pyWinhook, pyperclip, psutil, and pywin32, to capture keystrokes, mouse activity, active window information, and clipboard content. This information is aggregated in a global buffer for exfiltration to the C2 server. Collected data is not saved to disk.

The browser credential stealer operates as a standalone Python program capable of enumerating up to 120 profiles across Chromium-family browsers. It retrieves and derives local decryption keys using Windows DPAPI, Linux secret storage, or macOS Keychain/PBKDF2 to decrypt stored credentials and payment data. The decrypted information is transmitted in plaintext via HTTP POST requests to the /keys endpoint of the C2 server. This stealer does not work against Chrome's app-bound encryption and therefore does not extract passwords for versions of Chrome higher than 127.

InvisibleFerret conducts system fingerprinting immediately after execution, collecting OS details, hostname, username, and a unique host identifier derived from the SHA-256 hash of the system’s MAC address and username. It also gathers internal and external IP addresses, ISP information, geolocation coordinates, region, and timezone using external queries to ip-api[.]com. This data is promptly transmitted to its C2 infrastructure via the /keys endpoint, enabling operators to profile infected hosts for subsequent tasking.

Figure 10: InvisibleFerret system information data sent to C2 (Source: Recorded Future)

When traversing the directory of the infected machine, InvisibleFerret uses exclusion lists to enumerate files suitable for data exfiltration, while minimizing bandwidth consumption. The enumeration process applies two primary filtering criteria: file extensions must not be present in the ex_files exclusion list, and file sizes must not exceed 104,857,600 bytes (100 MB). Directory traversal is similarly filtered against the ex_dirs list. InvisibleFerret prioritizes document files, configuration files, and source code, while systematically excluding low-value artifacts that would unnecessarily consume network bandwidth and C2 storage resources.

Figure 11: InvisibleFerret file and directory exclusion lists (Source: Recorded Future)

On Windows systems, InvisibleFerret deploys an auxiliary keylogging component that hooks keyboard and mouse inputs, records the active process and window title, and captures clipboard contents during copy or paste operations. These logs are stored in a global buffer (e_buf) for on-demand exfiltration through a designated C2 command.

The InvisibleFerret commands are detailed in Table 3.

Table 3: InvisibleFerret RAT commands and descriptions (Source: Recorded Future)

One of the modules InvisibleFerret downloads is a browser stealer targeting Chromium-based browsers, including Chrome, Brave, Opera, Yandex, and Edge on Windows, Linux, and macOS systems. The malware focuses on harvesting browser-stored credentials and payment card information, which it exfiltrates in plaintext via HTTP POST requests to the /keys path of the C2 server. The stealer performs an enumeration of up to 120 browser profiles per browser to ensure maximum coverage of stored credentials across multi-profile configurations.

The module mirrors common open-source Chromium credential stealers.

On Windows, it reads the Local State file to Base64-decode the os_crypt.encrypted_key, strips the DPAPI prefix, unwraps the master key with CryptUnprotectData, then decrypts the Login Data (password manager) files using Chrome’s v80+ AES-GCM layout as documented in a public proof-of-concept.

On Linux, it uses secretstorage to read the browser’s “Safe Storage” item (historically defaulting to “peanuts”) and derives a 16-byte key using PBKDF2 and the salt “saltysalt” for AES-CBC decryption, matching widely shared examples and code.

On macOS, the command, security 2>&1 > /dev/null find-generic-password -ga, is run to obtain the Safe Storage secret and derive the decryption key with PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA1 (1003 iterations) before AES-CBC decryption, which aligns with long-standing reports.

Similar multi-browser, multi-profile enumeration and decryption logic is present in LaZagne and other cross-platform extractors, indicating the code is very likely derived from such sources.

InvisibleFerret splits control and collection across two services:

A persistent, RAW TCP interactive channel using a simple 4‑byte big‑endian length header followed by UTF‑8 JSON.

An HTTP service with various endpoints, initial beaconing, sending system information, exfiltration, and payload delivery. All transmissions observed are in plaintext.

Figure 12 illustrates the dual-channel C2 structure described above. The malware maintains two active C2 channels that operate concurrently to manage the infection lifecycle and data exfiltration.

The HTTP channel handles initial system beacons, payload delivery, and data exfiltration through endpoints /keys, /uploads, /brow, and /adc. In parallel, the persistent TCP channel sustains a long-lived session for interactive tasking via a structured command loop.

From the persistent connection, the C2 server can issue operational commands, such as ssh_obj (remote shell execution), ssh_upload (file exfiltration), or ssh_env (environment file theft), which direct the client to perform additional actions or interact with the HTTP endpoints for staged downloads and uploads.

Figure 12: InvisibleFerret C2 HTTP and TCP communication channels (Source: Recorded Future)

Data transmitted on the persistent channel adheres to a custom protocol, which includes a 4-byte big-endian length header followed by UTF-8 JSON. While the fields of the JSON object vary depending on the command, they all include a “code” field that indicates the command to be run and its output, as well as an “Admin” field for ID/Session tracking. Figure 13 shows the command 1 (ssh_obj), which executes a command. In this case, the command whoami is run, and the output is returned.

Figure 13: InvisibleFerret Whoami command sent to infected host (Source: Recorded Future)

The HTTP C2 channel uses multiple endpoints to conduct initial beaconing, transmit system information, facilitate data exfiltration, and deliver payloads. All observed communications occur in plaintext.

Initial beacon (/keys): Executes an HTTP POST request to the /keys endpoint containing a timestamp (ts), along with hard-coded parameters (type and hid). The request also includes the output of the sys_info function, which gathers details such as the OS version, system hostname, username, and UUID. Additionally, the beacon transmits geolocation data, including the public IP address, internet service provider, approximate physical location, and timezone.

Using Recorded Future Network Intelligence, Insikt Group identified 3,136 individual IP addresses linked to likely targets of PurpleBravo activity from August 2024 to September 2025, with a significant concentration in South Asia and North America. PurpleBravo has consistently targeted individuals working for entities in South Asia throughout 2025. Insikt Group notes this is based on Recorded Future’s visibility, and a complete picture of PurpleBravo activity could look different. While PurpleBravo targets software developers with fictitious job offers, Insikt Group has observed evidence of candidates taking malicious coding challenges on corporate devices, thereby compromising their employers. Many of these organizations are in the IT services space, including IT staff augmentation services. While organizations around the world are focused on the PurpleDelta threat, identifying and preventing fraudulent IT workers from gaining employment, Insikt Group assesses that the IT software supply chain is just as vulnerable to infiltration from North Korean state-sponsored threats.

Figure 16: Map of likely PurpleBravo targets by number (Source: Recorded Future)

Among the likely targets of PurpleBravo activity, Insikt Group identified twenty potential victim organizations based on network communications. The organizations are in the AI, cryptocurrency, financial services, IT services, marketing, and software development industries in Belgium, Bulgaria, Costa Rica, India, Italy, the Netherlands, Pakistan, Romania, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Vietnam. Many of these organizations advertise large customer bases, presenting an acute supply-chain risk to companies outsourcing work in these regions.

Recorded Future observed administrative communications to PurpleBravo C2 servers from multiple IP addresses, including 151 Astrill VPN nodes (See Appendix C). In some cases, administrative communications were observed from a single Astrill VPN node to up to six different C2 servers. Insikt Group and other cybersecurity vendors have previously observed PurpleBravo operators and PurpleDelta operators use Astrill VPN in their operations. Recorded Future also observed IP addresses from autonomous systems in China communicating with BeaverTail C2 administration ports in July and August 2025, including some geolocated to Changchun and Siping in Jilin province in China, near the North Korean border, and where North Korean threat groups are known to operate (see Appendix D).

PurpleBravo and PurpleDelta Overlap

As mentioned previously, some organizations track both PurpleBravo and PurpleDelta as the same campaign, while other reporting keeps these groups separate. Insikt Group has also chosen to keep these groups separate but has observed several points of overlap For example, in September 2025, researchers at SentinelOne identified the email address hundredup2023[@]gmail[.]com that was unintentionally exposed in a script on a PurpleBravo (Contagious Interview) malware distribution server. Using Recorded Future Identity Intelligence, Insikt Group was able to determine that the individual behind the address is also highly likely to be a PurpleDelta operator.

We determined that the owner of the email address hundredup2023[@]gmail[.]com was observed using AnyDesk remote desktop software and Astrill VPN, two applications commonly used by PurpleDelta. We also observed the process CallRI[.]exe, which is very likely an internal chat tool used between PurpleDelta operators, running on the system. Moreover, while the system time, pattern of life, and virtual private server (VPS) suggest the operator was using personas located in Eastern Europe, the operator consistently used the Hong Kong version of Google with simplified Chinese, suggesting they were physically located in East Asia.

The infostealer log showed the operator was consistently interested in remote Golang software development jobs in the United States. Insikt Group observed the operator attempting to use the SSN24 service, an automated dark web shop that specializes in the sale of compromised personally identifiable information (PII), along with multiple Telegram channels that sell LinkedIn and Upwork accounts. Insikt Group also observed evidence that the operator used the cryptocurrency exchange MEXC Exchange. The operator was also seen using proxy-seller[.]com , powervps[.]net , residentialvps[.]com , lunaproxy[.]com , and sms-activate[.]io , likely to purchase infrastructure. At least two AI tools, Perplexity and ChatGPT, assisted the operator in crafting job-related emails and providing guidance for job applications on Upwork, a freelance jobs website. The operator also installed the LazyApply extension on their web browser, a tool that automates job applications on multiple job websites.

Insikt Group observed the following additional email addresses being used on the same system:

aaron19101301[@]gmail[.]com

cryptofan1013[@]gmail[.]com

techsavvy001013[@]outlook[.]com

domin61013[@]outlook[.]com

rico.gonzalez1013[@]gmail[.]com

Insikt Group also observed an email address on the operator's system that appears to be for a legitimate software development company in Romania. It is unclear whether the operator was employed by the organization or was merely imitating it; however, the overlap in names between the personal Gmail address above and the Breakpoint IT email suggests a connection.

The names Aaron Porchia, Aaron Taylor, and Aaron Ham were frequently seen, along with what appears to be a Korean name, Ham Gon Il (함건일). Insikt Group was unable to definitively determine whether the Korean name is also being used as a persona. The operator uses a GitHub account with the username “domin191013” that is active at the time of this writing. Among the GitHub users “domin191013” follows is the profile “adonistoday”, an account that displays many common characteristics of a PurpleDelta operator. Pivoting on the profile “adonistoday”, the user follows a known PurpleDelta GitHub persona, “smartdev022”. These links highlight additional overlap with known PurpleDelta operations.

Data from Recorded Future Identity Intelligence shows the PurpleBravo operator potentially connected to a remote desktop session hosted on the IP address 135[.]181[.]7[.]162 with the GitHub profile “domin191013” open in the web browser. At the time of access, the GitHub profile used the alias “Aaron”, which is consistent with the email address and names seen above; however, the profile currently uses the alias “Boris”, as shown in Figure 17.

Figure 17: Screenshot of GitHub profile “domin191013” used by PurpleBravo operator (Source: GitHub)

The PurpleBravo operator was also observed using an online meeting application open called “CoolEx”, which has been flagged as a malicious scam in open sources. In their web browsing history, they navigated to a Telegram chat with a user who had previously been observed spreading malware via the CoolEx scam and then to a likely fake CoolEx meeting link. It is unclear whether the PurpleBravo operator was compromised by this scam; however, given that the individual has a CoolEx application on their system, Insikt Group assesses it is likely that they installed the malicious application.

Figure 18: PurpleBravo operator’s remote desktop from the Recorded Future Identity data showing the GitHub profile “domin191013” and the likely malicious online meeting application “CoolEx” (Source: Recorded Future)

Insikt Group observed the IP address 188[.]43[.]33[.]252 communicating with three PurpleBravo C2 servers (Table 4). While Insikt Group was unable to determine the exact nature of the communications, we assess that it is likely PurpleBravo operators were testing their C2 infrastructure from this IP address. The IP address 188[.]43[.]33[.]252 is assigned to Joint Stock Company Transtelecom and geolocated to Russia. The same Transtelecom IP address is also associated with PurpleDelta activity.

66[.]235[.]175[.]11767[.]203[.]7[.]205

Table 4: Observed PurpleBravo C2 servers communicating with Transtelecom IP address (Source: Recorded Future)

Previous Insikt Group reporting has also revealed occasional overlaps between PurpleBravo and PurpleDelta activity, with at least one PurpleBravo-linked individual operating a PurpleDelta-linked GitHub persona. Given the extensive evidence above indicating that the operator in control of the email hundredup2023[@]gmail[.]com is a member of PurpleDelta, along with the commonalities in network traffic, it strongly suggests an overlap between the groups.

Use Recorded Future Threat Intelligence: Recorded Future customers can proactively mitigate this threat by operationalizing Recorded Future Intelligence Operations Platform data, specifically by leveraging continuously updated Risk Lists and by blocklisting IP addresses associated with PurpleBravo C2 servers to block communication with malicious infrastructure.

Use Recorded Future Network Intelligence: Leverage Recorded Future’s Malicious Traffic Analysis events to proactively identify servers involved in PurpleBravo activity, along with targeted infrastructure and attack techniques, powered by Network Intelligence and other proprietary methodologies.

Use Recorded Future Reporting: Configure alerts in the Recorded Future Intelligence Operations Platform to track Insikt Group reporting on PurpleBravo activity.

Maintain a dedicated watchlist for PurpleBravo campaign indicators of compromise (IoCs), hosting providers, Astrill VPN nodes, and lure brands.

Block direct-to-IP HTTP/S traffic to non-standard ports, such as ports 1224 and 1244, which are commonly abused for C2 in PurpleBravo operations.

Restrict npm install and go get to allowlisted registries and mirror caches with malware scanning; require SLSA provenance attestations, which are documents that capture metadata about a software artifact, detailing the location, time, and process used to produce it for third-party code in critical repositories.

Hunt for Base64 decode and XOR loops in JS files touched within developer profiles; flag repositories that introduce those differences.

Build detection for Go binaries with embedded HackBrowserData artifacts or accessing multiple browser profiles in less than 60 seconds.

Require contractors to use company-managed, endpoint detection and response (EDR)-enrolled devices or secure virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI); forbid bring your own device (BYOD) policies for developer roles.

Provide security awareness training to employees related to common PurpleBravo approaches, social engineering themes, and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs); establish and communicate clear routes for employees to safely report suspicious external outreach or potential malware infections to internal security teams.

PurpleBravo has maintained a high operational tempo since the group was first publicly uncovered in November 2023. The amount of PurpleBravo infrastructure evident as of the time of this report suggests that the group has achieved success in its operations and will likely continue at a similar pace in the near term. While the group’s widespread targeting of software developers is global in scope, as seen in this report, the group has also significantly targeted the South Asia region. Similarly, although cryptocurrency theft may be the group’s primary focus, many of the compromised organizations operate in other areas, namely software development and IT services. This presents an acute supply-chain risk to organizations that rely on individual contractors or outsource their IT services work. While the North Korean IT worker employment threat has been widely publicized, the PurpleBravo supply-chain risk deserves equal attention so organizations can prepare, defend, and prevent sensitive data leakage to North Korean threat actors.

Threat and Vulnerability Management Systems: What Cybersecurity Teams Need in 2026

Traditional vulnerability management tools can no longer keep up with the speed of modern exploitation—threat context is now mandatory.

Threat and Vulnerability Management (TVM) systems unify asset discovery, vulnerability data, and real-time external threat intelligence to prioritize real risk.

Static CVSS scores fail to reflect exploitation likelihood; intelligence-driven, dynamic risk scoring is essential in 2026.

Organizations that integrate vulnerability intelligence and attack surface intelligence reduce remediation time and security waste, enhancing detection and remediation while reducing alert fatigue.

Why Threat and Vulnerability Management Must Evolve in 2026

Security teams currently find themselves at a crossroads. Year over year, CVE volumes continue to surge higher and higher. Exploitation is faster, more automated, and more targeted, meaning attacks are growing in volume, velocity, and sophistication alike. As a result, security teams are expected to “patch faster” with fewer resources and can no longer realistically keep up with this ever-rising tide of threats.

Thanks to these forces, security teams have found themselves in a state of affairs in which vulnerability management has become an exercise in sheer volume, not risk. Day in and day out, teams are overwhelmed by alerts that lack real-world context, making it all but impossible to assess the actual degree of risk.

Thankfully, there is a solution. Threat-informed vulnerability management (TVM) has emerged to counteract this trend, enabling security teams to intelligently address weaponized vulnerabilities, zero-day exploits, and supply chain and cloud-native risk. All this comes along with much-needed relief from creeping alert-fatigue.

In 2026, effective cybersecurity programs will be defined not by how many vulnerabilities they detect but by how precisely they understand, prioritize, and neutralize real threats using intelligence-driven TVM systems.

The Core Problem: Alert Fatigue and Prioritization Failure

As it stands today, the explosion in disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs) has outpaced humans’ abilities to triage and manage patching effectively. Today, the vast majority of organizations are incapable of remediating more than a fraction of the total identified issues affecting the ecosystem.

Traditionally, using a standard CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) was enough to overcome these challenges of prioritization. CVSS is an open, standardized framework used to assess the severity of security vulnerabilities by assigning a numerical score based on factors like exploitability, impact, and scope. Organizations use CVSS scores to prioritize remediation and compare vulnerabilities consistently across systems and vendors.

However, CVSS only measures theoretical severity, not exploitation likelihood. It misses critical pieces of context for prioritization decisions such as:

Is exploit code available?

Is the vulnerability actively exploited?

Are threat actors discussing or operationalizing it?

As a result, high-severity CVEs that pose little real-world risk continue to consume time and resources, leading us back once again to the issue of alert fatigue and the inability to effectively triage and patch the most pressing vulnerabilities.

At the same time, we are seeing modern organizations struggle with a “silo problem,” in which security, IT, and CTI (cyber threat intelligence) teams operate independently and with limited visibility and collaboration between one another. In many organizations, each of these teams ends up using different tools, establishing different priorities, sharing findings infrequently if at all, and adopting entirely different “risk languages” through which they understand, prioritize, and address threats.

Taken broadly, this leaves organizations woefully lacking a unified, intelligence-driven view of risk. Without this, many adopt a de facto policy of “patch everything”. And it comes with significant costs, including:

Operational drag and burnout

Delayed remediation of truly dangerous vulnerabilities

Increased business risk despite increased effort

Fractured security operations

Both individually, and in the aggregate, these side-effects come at a significant detriment to organizational security. And as the number and diversity of CVEs continues to expand, the greater that cost becomes. Moving forward, organizations must find a better way.

The Evolving Threat Landscape Demands a New Approach

Today’s ever-changing landscape means that organizations must evolve along with it or risk falling dangerously behind. The rise of rapidly weaponized vulnerabilities (i.e., known software weaknesses that have moved beyond disclosure and into active attacker use) reflects a fundamental shift in how quickly and deliberately adversaries turn CVEs into operational threats. Today, the gap between disclosure, proof-of-concept release, and active exploitation has collapsed from months to days (or even hours), driven largely by exploit marketplaces, automated scanning, and widely shared tooling.

Attackers increasingly prioritize vulnerabilities that are easy to exploit, broadly applicable across cloud services, edge devices, and common dependencies, and capable of delivering fast returns. Once weaponized, these vulnerabilities manifest not as theoretical risk but as active intrusion campaigns, ransomware operations, and opportunistic internet-wide exploitation, making threat context essential for distinguishing true danger from background noise.

At the same time that weaponization is accelerating, attack surfaces are expanding. The average attack surface today is expanding and fragmenting across hybrid and multi-cloud environments, all of which is worsened by SaaS sprawl, shadow IT, and third-party and supply chain exposure. In this environment, it is absolutely critical that security teams have a clear understanding of vulnerabilities vs. threats, and work to establish an integrated approach between the two.

In short, a vulnerability is a technical weakness, while a threat is an actor, campaign or event at work exploiting that weakness. In order to be truly effective, modern threat vulnerability management (TVM) systems must merge both concepts to reflect real risk and separate signal from noise.

What Is Threat and Vulnerability Management (TVM)?

Threat and Vulnerability Management (TVM) — also called Threat-Informed Vulnerability Management — is a continuous, intelligence-driven process that prioritizes remediation based on three core variables:

Threat actor behavior

TVM differs from traditional vulnerability management (VM) in a number of critical ways. Traditional VM relies on periodic scans, static severity scoring, and a largely reactive patching process. TVM, on the other hand, employs continuous monitoring, external threat intelligence enrichment, and close-loop remediation and validation.

This continuous, context-rich approach is foundational for modern security programs. Rather than inundating security teams with decontextualized CVEs and indiscriminate patching, modern TVM systems align security efforts with attacker reality. Reactive patching is replaced with proactive, risk-based decision-making, and as a result, organizations are able to reduce noise while simultaneously increasing the impact of their security operations.

The Five Core Pillars of Modern TVM Systems

As the speed and breadth of today’s threats continue to grow, traditional VM, being fundamentally reactive in nature, is no longer enough to keep up. In a world where vulnerabilities are exposed by the day, TVM offers much-needed efficiency, intelligence, and proactiveness. However, not all TVM systems are created equally. Here are five core pillars of effective modern TVM systems to help you evaluate and assess solutions on the market.

1. Continuous Asset Discovery & Inventory

Modern TVM systems are invaluable in that they provide full visibility across the entirety of an organization’s growing and fragmented attack surface. This includes external-facing assets, shadow IT, and cloud and SaaS environments alike. By providing continuous asset discovery and a timely, up-to-date inventory of one’s assets, TVM systems allow for real-time, comprehensive, attack-surface management.

Remember, you can’t defend what you can’t see. That’s why attack surface management (ASM) is a prerequisite for effective TVM. Without accurate, up-to-date asset inventories, vulnerability data is incomplete and misleading. Continuous discovery ensures defenders see their environment the way attackers do.

2. Vulnerability Assessment & Scoring

TVM goes beyond internal scanning tools to identify vulnerabilities exposed to the internet and reassess them continuously as environments change. This includes tracking misconfigurations, outdated services, and newly introduced exposure, not just known CVEs.

3. External Threat Context Enrichment

This is where TVM fundamentally diverges from legacy approaches. External threat intelligence enriches vulnerability data with insight from dark web and criminal forums, exploit marketplaces, malware telemetry, and active attack campaigns.

Vulnerabilities are mapped to known threat actors, active exploitation, and MITRE ATT&CK® techniques, ultimately transforming raw findings into actionable intelligence.

4. Risk-Based Prioritization (RBVM)

Risk-based vulnerability management prioritizes issues based on the probability of exploitation, asset importance, and threat actor interest. This shifts the focus from “most severe” to “most dangerous,” enabling teams to address the vulnerabilities that pose the greatest immediate risk to their organizations.

5. Automated Remediation & Verification

Modern TVM integrates directly with IT and SecOps workflows, pushing prioritized findings into ticketing and automation platforms. Just as importantly, it verifies remediation to confirm that patches were applied and exposure was actually reduced, creating a continuous feedback loop.

These five pillars of effective TVM systems come together to create a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts. These systems, unlike their predecessors, are designed to continuously monitor and triage real threats and vulnerabilities in context and ensure awareness and proactive mitigation without the risk of burn-out and alert fatigue.

Stop Patching Everything — Use Intelligence to Prioritize Real Risk

The scale of the CVE problem is overwhelming. Tens of thousands of vulnerabilities are disclosed each year, yet only a small fraction are ever exploited in the wild. Treating them all as equally urgent is not just inefficient — it’s dangerous.

Vulnerability intelligence changes the equation by tracking a CVE across its full lifecycle, from initial disclosure to weaponization, exploitation, and criminal adoption. This enables dynamic risk scoring that reflects real-world conditions rather than static assumptions.

Dynamic risk scoring incorporates evidence of active exploitation, availability of exploit code, dark web chatter, and threat actor interest. As conditions change, so does the risk score, ensuring prioritization remains aligned with attacker behavior.

The operational impact is significant. Security teams can focus remediation on the top 1% of vulnerabilities that pose immediate risk, respond faster, reduce operational cost, and strengthen overall security posture.

See Your Risk Like an Attacker: The Full Attack Surface View

In today’s threat landscape, security teams must recast the way they envision their roles. Rather than operating in a reactive, defensive manner at all times, security teams should think more like their adversaries, taking a complete view of their attack surface and leveraging modern tools and technologies to ensure intelligent, prioritized defenses. The following three key concepts will help you take on that mentality.

The Visibility Gap: Unknown assets create unknown risk. Traditional scanners often miss orphaned domains, misconfigured cloud services, and forgotten infrastructure — precisely the assets attackers look for first.

Attack Surface Intelligence Explained: Attack surface intelligence provides continuous mapping of domains, IPs, cloud assets, and external services. It identifies exposures attackers see before defenders do, enabling proactive remediation rather than reactive cleanup.

Connecting the Dots with Vulnerability Tools: When integrated with vulnerability scanners like Qualys and Tenable, attack surface intelligence provides a unified, prioritized view of exposure. Intelligence-driven platforms serve as a single source of truth for risk decisions, enabling teams to connect vulnerabilities to real-world exposure and threat activity.

Three Strategic Recommendations for Security Leaders

Most organizations remain behind the curve in threat and vulnerability management. Knowing what we know now, there are three strategic steps security leaders can take to reclaim control.

1. Bridge the Gap Between Security and IT

Establish a shared, intelligence-driven risk language. Align SLAs with real-world risk rather than raw severity scores, ensuring remediation efforts focus on what matters most.

2. Embrace Automation and Workflow Integration

Push prioritized findings directly into platforms like ServiceNow and SOAR tools. Reducing manual handoffs accelerates remediation and minimizes delays.

3. Measure What Matters — Time-to-Remediate (TTR)

Shift KPIs toward time-to-remediate actively exploited vulnerabilities and reduction in exposure windows. These metrics demonstrate real ROI and security impact.

The Path Forward Is Threat-Informed: Strengthen Your Threat and Vulnerability Strategy

Volume-based vulnerability management is no longer viable. As we progress through 2026, threat context is not optional. It is foundational.

Future-ready security programs are intelligence-led, automation-enabled, and attacker-aware. Recorded Future sits at the center of this shift, providing the intelligence backbone required to move from reactive patching to proactive risk reduction.

Explore how Recorded Future Vulnerability Intelligence and Attack Surface Intelligence can help your organization transition from alert-driven vulnerability management to intelligence-driven risk reduction.

By unifying threat intelligence, vulnerability data, and attack surface visibility, organizations can reduce alert fatigue, prioritize what truly matters, and proactively harden defenses against real-world threats before attackers exploit them.

Frequently Asked Questions

What is the primary difference between a Vulnerability and a Threat?

A Vulnerability is a weakness or flaw in an asset (e.g., unpatched software, misconfiguration) that could be exploited. A Threat is a person, group, or event (e.g., a threat actor, a piece of malware) that has the potential to exploit that vulnerability to cause harm.

What is the biggest challenge facing traditional vulnerability management programs today?

The biggest challenge is alert fatigue and prioritization noise. Traditional programs generate an overwhelming number of vulnerabilities, often relying only on the technical severity score (like CVSS). This leads security teams to waste time patching low-risk flaws while critical, actively exploited vulnerabilities remain unaddressed.

Why is integrating external threat intelligence mandatory for TVM in 2026?

External threat intelligence provides real-time context on the threat landscape. These days, it’s mandatory because it allows security teams to identify which vulnerabilities are being actively exploited in the wild, have associated proof-of-concept (PoC) code, or are being discussed on the dark web, enabling true risk-based prioritization.

How does Recorded Future Vulnerability Intelligence help with prioritization?

Recorded Future Vulnerability Intelligence automatically assigns a dynamic Risk Score to every CVE by correlating it with real-time threat intelligence from across the internet, including evidence of active exploitation, malware associations, and dark web chatter. This lets teams instantly know if a vulnerability is a theoretical risk or an immediate, active threat requiring urgent attention.

What is Attack Surface Intelligence, and what role does it play in TVM?

Attack Surface Intelligence is the continuous process of identifying and monitoring all external-facing assets of an organization (like public IPs, domains, and cloud services). In TVM, it is crucial to ensure that vulnerabilities are not just identified on known assets, but also on shadow IT and unknown exposed systems that are most likely to be targeted by adversaries.

How does the TVM lifecycle differ from the traditional vulnerability management lifecycle?

While both involve Discovery, Assessment, and Remediation, the TVM lifecycle adds an explicit Threat Analysis step before prioritization. The modern TVM cycle is typically:

[80] Recorded Future - Best Ransomware Detection Tools
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Best Threat Intelligence Tools for Ransomware Detection

Effective ransomware detection requires three complementary layers: endpoint and extended detection and response (EDR/XDR) to monitor device-level activity, network detection and response (NDR) to catch lateral movement, and threat intelligence tools to provide context that enables efficient prioritization.

The most valuable detection happens before ransomware encryption begins. Tools must identify precursor behaviors like reconnaissance, credential theft, and data staging rather than waiting for known indicators of compromise.

Intelligence quality determines detection quality: even sophisticated security tools require real-time threat data about active ransomware campaigns, attacker infrastructure, and current tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to distinguish genuine threats from noise.

Recorded Future strengthens the entire detection stack by providing organization-specific threat intelligence, early detection capabilities (in some cases, identifying victims up to 30 days before public extortion), and vulnerability intelligence focused on what ransomware groups are actively exploiting.

The ransomware playbook has fundamentally changed. Instead of casting wide nets with opportunistic phishing campaigns, attackers now focus on big-game hunting: targeting high-value enterprises with data theft and double or triple extortion tactics. Threat actors purchase pre-compromised access from brokers, exploit newly disclosed vulnerabilities within hours, and use automation to compress weeks-long campaigns into days.

The results are stark. Ransomware now appears in 44% of breaches, up from 32% the prior year, according to the 2025 Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report. Traditional signature-based detection tools often can't keep pace because ransomware groups continuously rotate their infrastructure, modify malware variants, and adopt new tactics faster than defenses can update. By the time a signature is written, the threat has already evolved.

This gap has created demand for a different approach: intelligence-driven ransomware detection. Rather than waiting for known indicators of compromise, these tools identify the precursor behaviors that happen before encryption (e.g. reconnaissance, credential theft, lateral movement, privilege escalation, and data staging).

The key is continuous external intelligence that maps what's happening in your environment to active campaigns and specific ransomware families operating in the wild.

The most effective defense combines three layers: endpoint and extended detection and response (EDR/XDR) to catch suspicious behaviors on devices, network detection and response (NDR) with deception technology to spot lateral movement, and threat intelligence tools that provide the real-time context tying it all together. When these tools share a common intelligence foundation, they can reveal malicious intent well before encryption begins.

The Ransomware Detection Tool Landscape: Three Pillars of Defense

Effective ransomware detection generally requires three complementary tool categories, each targeting different stages of an attack.

1. Endpoint and Extended Detection and Response (EDR/XDR) Tools

EDR and XDR platforms form the first line of defense, monitoring individual devices and user activity for signs of compromise.

EDR and XDR solutions monitor endpoints for suspicious behaviors like privilege escalation, credential dumping, unusual process creation, and bulk file modifications. When they detect threats, these tools automatically isolate devices, roll back changes, and contain threats, cutting response time from hours to seconds.

How Threat Intelligence Enhances EDR/XDR

Threat intelligence connects endpoint activity to active campaigns in the wild. When an EDR tool flags suspicious activity, intelligence context reveals whether it matches known campaigns from groups like LockBit, ALPHV/BlackCat, or BlackBasta. This can dramatically reduce false positives by distinguishing unusual-but-legitimate administrative work from activity aligned with active ransomware operations.

CrowdStrike Falcon delivers strong behavioral detection capabilities tied to comprehensive actor profiling. The platform's threat graph continuously correlates endpoint telemetry with global threat intelligence, enabling rapid identification of ransomware precursors.

Microsoft Defender XDR integrates telemetry across identity systems, endpoints, email, and cloud applications. This unified visibility helps security teams identify cross-domain attack patterns that indicate ransomware preparation, such as credential theft followed by lateral movement.

SentinelOne employs behavioral AI to detect malicious activity and offers automated rollback features that can reverse ransomware encryption and file modifications, effectively restoring systems to their pre-attack state.

2. Network Detection and Response (NDR) Tools

While EDR focuses on individual endpoints, NDR tools monitor the network layer to catch attackers as they move between systems.

NDR platforms watch internal network traffic to catch attackers moving laterally, scanning for targets, or accessing resources they shouldn't. The more advanced versions include deception technology like honeypots, fake credentials, and decoy systems that look like attractive targets. When attackers interact with these decoys during reconnaissance, security teams get early warnings before any real damage occurs.

How Threat Intelligence Improves NDR and Deception

Threat intelligence helps organizations customize deception environments based on active ransomware groups in their industry. When NDR tools spot anomalies such as unusual file sharing, unexpected queries, or abnormal transfers, intelligence matches these to current attack techniques, distinguishing administrative work from reconnaissance patterns before data staging begins.

Vectra AI specializes in detecting lateral movement and privilege misuse by correlating network behaviors with active attacker tradecraft. The platform's AI-driven detection identifies subtle deviations from normal network patterns that indicate ransomware reconnaissance.

ExtraHop Reveal(x) provides real-time network visibility that identifies reconnaissance activity and command-and-control (C2) communications. The platform's deep packet inspection capabilities reveal malicious traffic even when encrypted or obfuscated.

Illusive (now part of Zscaler) deploys deception technology specifically tuned to adversary behaviors. The platform's decoys and fake credentials create a minefield for attackers, triggering high-confidence alerts when threat actors interact with deception assets.

3. Threat Intelligence Tools

The third pillar provides the context that makes endpoint and network detection tools more accurate and actionable.

Threat intelligence tools pull together global threat data from sources like dark web forums, malware repositories, scanning activity, and criminal infrastructure. They enrich alerts from your other security tools with context about who's behind an attack, which campaign it's part of, and what techniques the attackers are likely to use next.

How Threat Intelligence Strengthens Ransomware Detection

These tools deliver several critical capabilities that transform how security teams identify and respond to ransomware threats:

Threat Mapping: Identifies whether your organization matches the targeting profile of active ransomware groups based on your industry, size, region, and technology stack. Specific operators are mapped using their TTPs to determine the intent and opportunity of carrying out a successful attack against your business.

Infrastructure Tracking: Monitors ransomware operators' continuous infrastructure shifts in real-time, identifying new C2 servers, drop sites, and payment infrastructure as they emerge.

Variant Identification: Rapidly analyzes and disseminates indicators when ransomware groups release new malware variants, enabling detection before signature-based systems receive updates.

Exploitation Intelligence: Identifies specific CVEs and misconfigurations that attackers are actively weaponizing, moving vulnerability management from severity-score-driven to threat-driven prioritization.

Risk Scoring: Provides real-time scores combining multiple intelligence signals—indicator prevalence, campaign association, TTP alignment—to guide analysts toward genuine threats rather than generic suspicious activity.

Recorded Future delivers organization-specific threat intelligence powered by The Intelligence Graph and proprietary AI. The platform provides end-to-end visibility into exposures, while research from its Insikt Group enables early detection of ransomware activity, identifying potential victims up to 30 days before public extortion.

Flashpoint specializes in deep and dark web intelligence, monitoring criminal forums, marketplaces, and chat channels where ransomware operators communicate, recruit, and trade access. This visibility into adversary communities provides early warnings about emerging threats and campaigns.

Google Threat Intelligence (formerly Mandiant) combines frontline incident response insights with global threat tracking. The platform leverages intelligence from breach investigations to identify ransomware group behaviors and attack patterns as they emerge.

Choosing the Right Ransomware Detection Tools

Security leaders must distinguish between tools that reduce ransomware risk and those that add noise. The most effective tools share several characteristics.

Security leaders should prioritize:

Pre-encryption visibility: Detect credential misuse, suspicious access, and lateral movement during reconnaissance and preparation phases when interventions are most effective.

Context-rich alerts: Alerts should include TTPs, infrastructure associations, and known actor activity and explain not just what triggered an alert but why it matters.

Integration maturity: Smooth data flow into SIEM, SOAR, and existing investigation workflows without creating siloed intelligence or blind spots.

Operational efficiency: Tools should reduce alert noise, not add to it, decreasing time-to-detection and time-to-response.

Relevance: Intelligence must map to current campaigns. Generic or stale indicators waste analyst time and create false confidence.

Scalability: Handle hybrid environments spanning on-premises infrastructure, multiple cloud providers, and remote endpoints without performance degradation.

How Recorded Future Enables Early Ransomware Detection

The quality of threat intelligence directly determines detection effectiveness. Even sophisticated endpoint and network tools require high-fidelity, current threat data to generate value. Security teams have plenty of options for tools; the real challenge is addressing alert fatigue draining analyst time on false positives instead of credible threats.

Recorded Future functions as the continuous intelligence layer strengthening the entire detection stack. Rather than adding another alert-generating tool, it feeds existing security ecosystems with real-time context about ransomware operator behavior.

Real-Time Relevance Through SecOps Intelligence

Every alert that hits your SIEM or endpoint platform gets automatically enriched with real-time risk scores, associated malware and infrastructure, and links to known attacker techniques and campaigns. Security tools can immediately recognize whether an indicator matches an active ransomware operation, cutting triage time from hours to minutes.

Proactive Mitigation Through Vulnerability Intelligence

Recorded Future identifies which vulnerabilities ransomware groups are actually exploiting right now, not just which ones have the highest theoretical severity ratings. This distinction matters because most high-severity vulnerabilities never get exploited in the wild, while some medium-severity vulnerabilities become critical the moment ransomware operators weaponize them.

The platform shows you which vulnerabilities specific ransomware groups are targeting, where exploit code is available, and which vulnerabilities are generating buzz in criminal forums. This lets security teams prioritize patching based on what attackers are actually doing, focusing on the access vectors most likely to result in ransomware incidents.

Victimology and Anticipation

Intelligence about dark web chatter, leak site activity, and victimology patterns reveals which industries, geographies, and technologies are being targeted. When Recorded Future detects increased targeting of specific sectors, SOC analysts can anticipate attack paths, tighten access controls, and implement protective measures before campaigns reach their network.

This closes the gap between reconnaissance and encryption. Most traditional tools don't trigger alerts until ransomware starts encrypting systems, by which point attackers have already stolen data. Intelligence-driven detection can catch the reconnaissance, credential theft, and lateral movement phases that happen first, shifting your response window from reactive damage control to proactive early containment.

Shifting From Reactive Response to Intelligence-Led Prevention

No single tool stops ransomware. The strongest defense is an integrated ecosystem where endpoint detection, network monitoring, and threat analysis platforms work from the same intelligence foundation.

Intelligence elevates these tools from reactive detection to early recognition of adversary behavior during preparation and reconnaissance phases, enabling intervention before ransomware reaches its destructive phase. Organizations that build detection architecture on real-time threat intelligence will adapt as quickly as their adversaries, maintaining effective defenses as the threat landscape evolves.

Frequently Asked Questions

Can behavioral analytics alone stop zero-day ransomware variants?

While powerful, behavioral analytics alone cannot guarantee a stop to a true zero-day ransomware variant. It excels at detecting malicious behavior (like mass file encryption or privilege escalation), even from unknown malware. The most effective defense is a combination of behavioral analytics, up-to-the-minute threat intelligence on emerging TTPs, and controlled execution (sandboxing).

What is the most common weakness of signature-based ransomware detection methods today?

The primary weakness is their reactive nature. Signature-based tools only detect known threats—they require a threat to be analyzed and its signature created before they can flag it. They are easily bypassed by polymorphic ransomware or customized, novel variants that threat actors create to evade detection.

How can Recorded Future's SecOps Intelligence Module help my existing EDR/XDR tool detect ransomware faster?

Recorded Future's SecOps Intelligence Module ingests and correlates massive amounts of external threat data. It directly integrates with your existing EDR/XDR tools, enriching alerts with real-time context (Risk Scores, actor TTPs, associated malware). This helps your existing tools move beyond basic indicators, prioritize critical alerts, and automatically initiate responses before a potential ransomware event escalates.

How does Recorded Future provide victimology data to anticipate ransomware attacks targeting my industry?

Recorded Future's Threat Intelligence Module provides crucial victimology and actor insights. It monitors real-time chatter on the dark web and forums to identify specific ransomware groups, their infrastructure, and the industries or regions they are planning to target next. This allows you to prioritize defenses based on pre-attack relevance.

Is a dedicated deception technology platform considered a primary ransomware detection tool?

Deception technology is not a primary prevention tool, but it is an extremely effective early detection tool. It places fake assets (honeypots, fake credentials) within the network. When an attacker, particularly ransomware moving laterally, interacts with a decoy, it immediately triggers a high-fidelity alert, providing security teams with crucial seconds to isolate the endpoint and stop the attack before encryption begins.

[TAM METİN - 529 kelime]
A 37-year-old Nigerian man was sentenced to eight years in prison for participating in a five-year cybercrime spree to steal money from the U.S. government through fraudulent tax returns, the Justice Department said Wednesday.

Matthew Abiodun Akande was living in Mexico when he and at least four co-conspirators broke into the networks of tax preparation firms, stole sensitive data on their clients and filed fraudulent tax returns, claiming tax refunds with victims’ personal data, according to court records.

Akande and his co-conspirators filed more than 1,000 fraudulent tax returns seeking more than $8.1 million in phony tax refunds during a five-year period ending in June 2021, prosecutors said. The crew collectively obtained more than $1.3 million in fraudulent tax refunds.

Officials said Akande also advanced the scheme by sending phishing emails to five Massachusetts-based tax preparation firms that were designed to trick employees into downloading remote access trojan malware, including Warzone RAT. Four of those firms were listed as victims in the indictment.

Akande has been in detention since he was arrested at Heathrow Airport in the United Kingdom in October 2024 and extradited to the United States in March 2025. A month later, Akande pleaded guilty to all 33 counts in the indictment prosecutors filed against him in July 2022.

His crimes include conspiracy to obtain unauthorized access to protected computers, wire fraud, unauthorized access to protected computers, theft of government money, and aggravated identity theft.

Akande and his alleged co-conspirators — Kehinde Hussein Oyetunji, a Nigerian national living in North Dakota, and two people that prosecutors declined to name — directed the fraudulent tax refunds to be deposited in U.S. bank accounts. Co-conspirators living in the United States withdrew some of the stolen money in cash then, at Akande’s direction, transferred a portion of the funds to third parties in Mexico, officials said.

In a sentencing memo submitted to the court, Akande’s lawyer insisted his client was not living an extravagant lifestyle in Mexico. Yet, he was ordered to pay almost $1.4 million in restitution as part of his sentencing.

[82] Cyberscoop - Fulton County lawsuit claims feds used ‘gross mischaracterizations’ to justify raid
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Wed, 18 Feb 2026 15:59:15 +0000
Link: https://cyberscoop.com/fulton-county-election-raid-expert-testimony-ryan-macias/

[TAM METİN - 784 kelime]
A former federal official who tested and certified voting machines used in Fulton County, Georgia for the 2020 presidential election told a court that the federal government misrepresented key facts and omitted exculpatory public evidence while seeking a warrant in last month’s law enforcement raid.

The raid, carried out by the FBI and overseen by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, saw agents seize ballots and other documentation from the Fulton County election offices. A public affidavit cited five core allegations related to the county’s recordkeeping, electronic ballot image storage,  and election night reporting. Authorities allege these issues point to a potential conspiracy to intentionally manipulate the vote count in favor of Democrat Joe Biden.

Fulton County officials sued the federal government in response, arguing that the affidavit used to obtain a warrant for the raid “does not identify facts that establish probable cause that anyone committed a crime.”

Another filing includes sworn testimony from Ryan Macias, an elections expert who tested and certified the county’s voting machines while at the Election Assistance Commission. In his testimony, Macias told the court that the government’s key claims have already been investigated and have been found to be baseless.

He said the FBI’s “many individual omissions and misstatements” in its affidavit reflect “gross mischaracterizations” of how elections work and directly contradict the conclusions of multiple prior investigations into the Nov. 2020 election in Fulton County.

“Once the statements and omissions in the Affidavit are corrected and based on my experience administering elections, the Affidavit does not have a substantial basis in reality,” Macias stated.

For instance, the FBI’s affidavit cites the absence of scanned images of all 527,925 ballots for the original count and recount. But Macias, who served as an adviser to Fulton County and witnessed pre and post-election operations in 2020, said this was standard practice.  Jurisdictions typically send only the vote count records from their machines on election night, because ballot images and audit logs are much larger files that can slow down the reporting process.

Macias also notes that the FBI affidavit omits that this issue was already investigated by Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who found Georgia election workers weren’t required by law to preserve such images until a state law passed in 2021.

An investigator from Raffensperger’s office later told the Board of Elections that “it was “important to note that ballots can be scanned and tabulated without capturing ballot images,” while general counsel Charlene McGowan testified that ballot images play no role in the vote tabulation process and Fulton County’s paper ballots – counted three times – were the “most important” documents to verify the count.

“These explanations about the storing of ballot images have been publicly available for some time,” Macias noted.

Similarly, the FBI cites instances where some Fulton County ballots were scanned multiple times, claiming it shows evidence of “an intentional tabulation of ballots in a false matter” to make the recount and original vote counts match. The bureau also pointed to small, non-determinative differences between the county’s machine recount and totals from a hand-counted risk-limiting audit.

But the federal government again failed to mention in its petition for a warrant that these claims were “exhaustively” investigated by the Secretary of State’s office, which found the errors were benign, the duplicates weren’t counted, and did not impact the final vote count in the state’s count of the 2020 presidential contest.

According to Macias, the government’s affidavit also contains errors about basic facts about Fulton County’s reporting process. This includes misreporting the correct official vote count and the date and time it was transmitted to state officials for tabulation.

[83] Cyberscoop - Chinese hackers exploited a Dell zero-day for 18 months before anyone noticed
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Wed, 18 Feb 2026 00:32:44 +0000
Link: https://cyberscoop.com/china-brickstorm-grimbolt-dell-zero-day/

[TAM METİN - 770 kelime]
Researchers uncovered more worrying details about a long-running cyber espionage campaign suspected to be backed by the Chinese government, exemplifying how such attacks often go undetected until they’ve already caused significant damage.

Google Threat Intelligence Group and Mandiant said the Chinese threat group UNC6201 has been exploiting a zero-day vulnerability in Dell RecoverPoint for Virtual Machines since at least mid-2024. The group overlaps with UNC5221, also known as Silk Typhoon, which has been burrowing into critical infrastructure and government agency networks undetected since at least 2022.

The zero-day exploitation marks an escalation from this particular cluster of actors.  State-sponsored attackers spent years implanting Brickstorm malware into networks before the campaign was finally detected last summer. By September, however, the attackers had replaced Brickstorm with Grimbolt, a more advanced malware that’s harder to detect, Google security researchers said Tuesday.

The zero-day vulnerability — CVE-2026-22769 — hinges on a hardcoded administrator password in Dell RecoverPoint for Virtual Machines that was pulled from Apache Tomcat. It carries a 10/10 CVSS rating. The Chinese threat group has been using the hardcoded password, which triggers the vulnerability and allows unauthenticated remote attackers to gain full system access with root-level persistence for at least 18 months, Google said.

Dell Technologies disclosed and released a patch for the vulnerability Tuesday. A company spokesperson urged customers to follow guidance in its security advisory.

“We are aware of less than a dozen impacted organizations, but because the full scale of this campaign is unknown we recommend that organizations previously targeted by Brickstorm look out for Grimbolt in their environments,” Austin Larsen, principal analyst at GTIG, told CyberScoop.

When the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency unveiled new details about the campaign in December, Google said dozens of U.S. organizations, not including downstream victims, had already been impacted by Brickstorm.

“The actor is likely still active in unpatched and remediated environments, and because exploitation has been occurring since mid-2024, they have had significant time to establish persistence and carry out long-term espionage,” Larsen added.

The campaign — one of many concurrent efforts by China state-sponsored groups to embed themselves into networks for long-term access, disruptions and potential sabotage — remains a top area of concern for national security.

CISA, the National Security Agency and Canadian Centre for Cyber Security released new analysis on Brickstorm last week to share indicators and compromise that could help potential victims detect malicious activity on their networks.

Yet, the China-linked groups involved in this campaign have already moved on to Grimbolt, in some cases replacing older Brickstorm binaries with the new backdoor that’s more difficult to reverse engineer, according to Google.

Marci McCarthy, director of public affairs at CISA, told CyberScoop the agency will share further information on Wednesday.

Google’s fresh research on the China state-sponsored campaign demonstrates how the threat group’s tenacity, and ability to dwell undetected in networks longer than 400 days, keeps defenders and cyber authorities at a disadvantage.

The threat groups typically target edge applications and devices running on systems without endpoint detection and response, but researchers don’t know how attackers broke into the networks of the most recently discovered victims.

Researchers only have a narrow view of the threat groups’ activities at large.

“We suspect a significant portion of UNC5221 and UNC6201’s activity likely remains unknown, and there is a strong probability that they are developing or using undiscovered zero-days and malware,” Larsen said. “The most concerning aspect of this campaign is that additional organizations were likely compromised as part of this campaign and do not know it yet.”

[84] Cyberscoop - Polish authorities arrest alleged Phobos ransomware affiliate
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Tue, 17 Feb 2026 18:23:04 +0000
Link: https://cyberscoop.com/phobos-ransomware-affiliate-arrested-poland/

[TAM METİN - 525 kelime]
Polish officials arrested a 47-year-old man accused of participating in ransomware attacks as an affiliate for the Phobos ransomware group, the country’s Central Bureau for Combating Cybercrime said Tuesday.

Authorities did not name the man who was arrested during a raid on his apartment in the Małopolskie province, but said he faces up to five years in prison for his alleged crimes.

The arrest is the latest in a series of coordinated law enforcement actions targeting people involved with Phobos ransomware attacks, which were also carried out by the 8base ransomware group. Polish officials said they identified the suspect through the “Phobos Aetor” operation, a Europol-led effort involving agencies across Europe, Asia and North America that took place in February 2025.

Officials accused the 47-year-old man of possessing credentials, credit card numbers and IP addresses for servers that may have been used to conduct various attacks. He also had tools that could breach servers and used encrypted messaging platforms to communicate with others linked to Phobos, police said.

During the raid, police said they seized a computer and multiple mobile phones that were used to commit cyberattacks. The unnamed suspect was charged with producing, obtaining and sharing computer programs used to illegally obtain information stored on IT systems.

Phobos ransomware had claimed more than 1,000 victims globally and received more than $16 million in extortion payments by February 2025, according to the Justice Department. Victims of Phobos ransomware attacks, which date back to at least November 2020, include hospitals, schools, non-profit organizations, and a company that contracted with the Defense Department, officials said.

Malicious activity linked to Phobos significantly declined when Russian national Evgenii Ptitsyn, the alleged developer and administrator of Phobos ransomware, was extradited from South Korea to the United States in November 2024.

Ptitsyn, also known as “derxan” and “zimmermanx,” was charged with multiple counts of cybercrime, including wire fraud, wire fraud conspiracy, conspiracy to commit computer fraud and abuse, extortion in relation to hacking and causing intentional damage to protected computers.

Pretrial motions for his case are due this week in the U.S. District Court of Maryland.

[85] Cyberscoop - Palo Alto Networks’ Koi acquisition is all about keeping AI agents in check
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[TAM METİN - 613 kelime]
Palo Alto Networks announced Tuesday its plans to buy security startup Koi, a deal aimed at addressing the security risks emerging as organizations rapidly adopt agentic AI.

Terms were not disclosed, but Israeli business outlet Globes reported that Palo Alto will pay approximately $400 million. The deal is another among a trend of larger cybersecurity industry companies buying AI-focused security startups.

In a statement announcing the agreement, Palo Alto Networks argues that “agentic” tools are reshaping endpoint risk because they can act with broad privileges, interact with multiple systems and move data in ways that older security products were not designed to monitor. For years, endpoint protection emphasized detecting malicious files and stopping known malware techniques. The new concern described in the announcement centers on legitimate software that can become dangerous through compromise, misconfiguration or abuse. AI agents, in this framing, resemble highly capable insiders: they operate using a user’s credentials, can take actions on a user’s behalf and may do so automatically and at speed.

“AI agents and tools are the ultimate insiders,” said Lee Klarich, Palo Alto’s chief product & technology officer. “They have full access to your systems and data, but operate entirely outside the view of traditional security controls. By acquiring Koi, we will be closing this gap and setting a new standard for endpoint security. We will give our customers the visibility and control required to safely harness the power of AI — ensuring that every agent, plugin, and script is governed, verified, and secure.”

Palo Alto Networks says Koi’s technology would be integrated into its Prisma AIRS AI security platform and would enhance the company’s Cortex XDR endpoint product. The stated goal is better visibility into AI-driven activity on endpoints and additional controls over tools that fall outside conventional security monitoring.

Palo Alto Networks and Koi describe their approach moving forward as “Agentic Endpoint Security,” built around visibility into AI-related software, continuous risk analysis and real-time policy enforcement. The language suggests an attempt to define a new product category at a moment when enterprises are still deciding how to govern AI tools that are proliferating through developer workflows and everyday office software.

The proposed acquisition also signals how major security vendors may respond to enterprise AI adoption: by packaging agent governance, monitoring and control into endpoint and cloud security portfolios, and by treating AI-driven automation as a distinct source of risk rather than a feature layered onto existing defenses.

The acquisition is the second AI-focused deal for Palo Alto in the plast six months. In November, the company announced it was acquiring Chronosphere, an AI-focused observability firm, for $3.35 billion.

[86] Cyberscoop - Citizen Lab links Cellebrite to the hacking of a Kenyan presidential candidate’s phone
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[TAM METİN - 642 kelime]
Researchers have found forensic evidence suggesting that Kenyan authorities used Cellebrite’s phone-cracking technology on the device of a prominent human rights activist after arresting him, according to a report published Tuesday.

The University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab said the intrusion is a sign of growing abuse of Cellebrite’s technology. According to the report, after his widely criticized  arrest in July amid mass protest, Boniface Mwangi noticed that his personal phone no longer required a password to access. The government initially suggested it might pursue  terrorism charges, but  later backed away from that and instead filed lesser offenses.

After the incident, Mwangi gave his phone to Citizen Lab for forensic analysis. The group said it found evidence of Cellebrite’s use, potentially to extract data from his device.

Mwangi told CyberScoop he felt a “very strong feeling of violation” after that, as his phone contained family photos, conversations with loved ones and even his plans for running for president, a bid he announced in August.

“I’ve been shot, I’ve been jailed, I’ve been tortured, I’ve been assaulted in many, many ways,” he continued. “So this is more emotional than physical, because I feel like someone was in your private thoughts — the things that you think, that you think should never be public.”

Citizen Lab said the incident showed that Cellebrite’s claims of safeguards against abuse via an ethics committee aren’t sufficient.

“Boniface Mwangi’s case wasn’t the first Cellebrite abuse case, and it won’t be the last, because Cellebrite has a global abuse problem,” John Scott-Railton, senior researcher at the organization, told CyberScoop. “When Cellebrite sells their technology to a security service with a track record of abuses, journalists, activists, and people speaking their conscience are at risk. It’s time for Cellebrite to take action and prove that their ethics committee isn’t a Potemkin village and their vetting procedures aren’t just empty platitudes.”

The U.S. government, including the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, also uses Cellebrite’s products and services.

Citizen Lab sent Cellebrite a list of questions, but the company did not respond to them. Cellebrite did, however,  defend its approach in a response to CyberScoop.

“Cellebrite maintains a rigorous process for reviewing allegations of technology misuse,” said Victor Cooper, a company spokesperson. “When credible, substantiated evidence is presented directly to our team, we investigate thoroughly and take decisive action, up to and including license termination.

“We do not respond to speculation and encourage any organization with specific, evidence-based concerns to share them with us directly so we can act on them,” he continued.

“Cellebrite operates under stringent compliance and ethics frameworks. We stand behind our vetting processes, our Ethics & Integrity Committee and our record of enforcement.”

Neither a spokesperson for the Kenyan government nor the Kenyan embassy in Washington, D.C. answered requests for comment Monday.

[87] Cyberscoop - Unit 42: Nearly two-thirds of breaches now start with identity abuse
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Tue, 17 Feb 2026 11:00:00 +0000
Link: https://cyberscoop.com/attackers-abuse-identity-unit42-palo-alto-networks-incident-response-report/

[TAM METİN - 911 kelime]
Identity is still the primary entry point for cyberattacks, according to Palo Alto Networks’ threat intelligence firm Unit 42. In its annual incident response report released Tuesday, Unit 42 found that identity-based techniques accounted for nearly two-thirds of all initial network intrusions last year.

Social engineering was the leading attack method, accounting for one-third of the 750 incidents Unit 42 responded to in the one-year period ending in September 2025. Attackers also bypassed security controls with compromised credentials, brute-force attacks, overly permissive identity policies and insider threats, researchers said.

The persistent pitfalls of identity extended beyond initial access, with an identity-related element playing a critical role in nearly 90% of all incidents last year. Unit 42’s report highlights the explosive impact of identity abuse, and pins much of the problem on poor security controls and misconfigurations across interconnected tools and systems.

“Across the attack lifecycle, the biggest thing is that once you have an identity, you’ve got everything, you’ve got the key and you’re in,” Sam Rubin, senior vice president of consulting and threat intelligence at Unit 42, told CyberScoop. “From a defense standpoint, enterprises are still not very good at finding the signal in the noise, essentially the detection when an identity-based tactic is used because there isn’t unauthorized access per se from a technical telemetry standpoint, and it becomes a harder detection mechanism.”

Vulnerability exploits, an ever-moving target, were still prolific and accounted for 22% of initial intrusions across attacks, but humans remain the weakest link, Rubin said.

The rise of machine-based identities and AI agents, which require an identity to take action, is expanding the attack surface for cybercriminals. Identity challenges are manifesting in the software supply chain as well, as API access and SaaS integrations become another weak link and way in for attackers if control keys aren’t properly controlled.

An attack on Salesloft Drift customers last summer highlighted how tightly integrated services can unravel and expose victims that are multiple layers removed from the vendor. More than 700 organizations were impacted directly, but Salesloft Drift’s integrations with dozens of third-party tools opened many additional paths of potential compromise.

More broadly, attackers are jumping from branch offices into a victims’ headquarters or data centers because too many accounts remain over permissioned and cloud-based accounts are established with too much privilege or a lack of segmentation, Rubin said.

These gaps allow threat groups to turn break-ins into significant attacks.

“We just see this time and again that there could have been better identity-based practices that would have constrained the blast radius, even if it didn’t stop the initial access,” Rubin said.

“It’s a problem of signal and noise,” he added. “Think about a global enterprise and all of this authenticated, legitimate activity happening every day. How do you see and identify the one instance where a user is already authenticated but doing something that they shouldn’t do?”

Large and older organizations are at a greater disadvantage, Rubin said. Over time, their technology stacks have evolved to include legacy systems acquired through various business deals. This leaves IT teams managing a patchwork of disparate systems that are poorly integrated, creating significant security vulnerabilities.

“We forgot as defenders to consider the entire attack chain, because too often we see the defense happens in silos,” Rubin said, adding that attacks that pivot from endpoints to cloud-based services are commonly missed.

Each of those jumps gives defenders a chance to  thwart attacks. Nearly 90% of the attacks Unit 42 investigated last year involved malicious activity across multiple attack surfaces.

Financially motivated attacks accounted for most of the 750 incidents Unit 42 responded to last year. Unit 42 did not say how many of those attacks resulted in payments, but it said median payments increased 87% year-over-year to $500,000 last year.

Attackers continue to pick up speed as well, exfiltrating data from victim networks under a median duration of two days. Attackers stole data in under one hour in 22% of the attacks Unit 42 responded to last year.

Unit 42’s annual look-back spotlights critical areas of concern and attack trends that continue to take root, yet it’s not comprehensive. The report’s visibility is limited to incidents that went from bad to worse and prompted victims to seek help from Unit 42.

“The hardest thing about incident response in cybersecurity,” Rubin said, “is there is no one global spot for how much is going on.”

[88] Cyberscoop - Why ‘secure-by-design’ systems are non-negotiable in the AI era
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Tue, 17 Feb 2026 11:00:00 +0000
Link: https://cyberscoop.com/data-center-security-ai-infrastructure-investment-op-ed/

[TAM METİN - 1847 kelime]
Moody’s recently reported that global investment in data centers will surpass $3 trillion over the next five years, driven by AI capacity growth and hyperscaler demand. As big tech companies, banks, and institutional investors pour capital into these projects, data center developers and their financial sponsors must prioritze cybersecurity.

Moody’s said that data center investments made by the six largest U.S. cloud computing providers  — Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Oracle, Meta, and CoreWeave — approached $400 billion last year. The firm anticipates that annual global investment will grow by $200 billion over the next two years.

Real estate firm Jones Lang LaSalle forecasted similar investment flows in a separate report published earlier this year, projecting that “nearly 100 GW of new data centers will be added between 2026 and 2030, doubling global capacity.” JLL said that this infrastructure investment “supercycle,” one of the largest in the modern era, will result in $1.2 trillion in real estate asset value creation and the need for roughly $870 billion of new debt financing.

In concert, these reports reflect a growing reality: Data centers are strategic, interconnected infrastructure supporting our manufacturing, national security, and communication systems. Cyber disruptions, whether through ransomware, supply-chain compromise, or operational technology (OT) compromises, can cascade beyond a single facility, threatening grid stability, cloud services, economic activity, and public safety.

Data centers are now critical hubs of energy demand and digital dependency. Their cybersecurity posture is directly tied to the resilience of the industrial and energy ecosystem that support them. For investors and stakeholders, cybersecurity should be fundamental to asset value and risk management. Strong cybersecurity directly affects uptime guarantees, regulatory exposure, insurance coverage, financing terms, and long-term valuation.

The most significant cybersecurity risks now center on three critical areas: data center-grid convergence, supply-chain vulnerabilities, and secure-by-design considerations. Data center operators and their financial backers must address these interconnected threats to protect both individual facilities and the broader system they support.

The cybersecurity challenge facing the data center supercycle stems from how these campuses are tightly coupled with both the public power grid and their own industrial control systems. As hyperscale and AI‑optimized facilities proliferate, their constant demand for high‑quality electricity shapes grid planning and reliability. These large campuses function less like traditional real estate and more like critical energy infrastructure nodes.

This shift comes as grid capacity tightens. The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) has warned that demand from new data centers will outpace energy supply growth in the coming years. A cyber incident that disrupts a major data center or degrades its industrial control systems can propagate into regional grid reliability issues, contract penalties, and broader economic disruption.

At the same time, the OT running these sites — building management, systems, cooling controls, battery and generator management — create dense cyber‑physical exposure. Global insurer Marsh notes that events in these systems, whether from human error or cyberattack, can cause physical damage and significant business interruption. The 2021 OVHcloud data center fire in Strasbourg, France destroyed an entire facility and disrupted services for thousands of customers, showing how failures in fire protection and cooling systems rapidly escalate. into catastrophic loss. Those safety functions now run through interconnected, remote-access-enabled OT systems.

Secure‑by‑design architectures for both grid‑side interfaces and on‑site OT are prerequisites for preventing this rapidly expanding energy–data infrastructure from becoming a single, converged point of failure.

AI‑optimized campuses depend on massive volumes of GPUs, high‑density servers, network appliances, OT controllers, and edge devices. Many of these components are designed, manufactured, or assembled in jurisdictions at the center of great‑power competition, particularly China. Reports warn that state-aligned actors could introduce backdoors, malicious firmware, or weaponize delivery timelines to create strategic outages.

Secure‑by‑design must start at procurement. Security-conscious procurement requires stringent vendor due diligence, diversification away from single‑country dependencies, hardware and firmware validation before deployment, and alignment with export controls and national‑security guidance on high‑risk equipment. The bill of materials (BoM) for a modern data center must be treated like a living threat surface, with traceability from chip manufacture through installation, including approved vendor lists, tamper‑evident logistics, and mandatory firmware attestation.

Procurement teams need escalation paths for opaque supply chains, unexplained cost changes, or “gray‑market” alternatives, plus playbooks for rapidly substituting vendors when geopolitical shocks or sanctions make a product line unacceptable.

Governance around supply‑chain risk must reach the same level as power, cooling, and uptime guarantees in contracts with hyperscalers and large tenants. Secure‑by‑design campuses will embed requirements for hardware provenance, firmware update hygiene, and ongoing vulnerability disclosure into master service agreements and construction/operations contracts, with clear accountability when a supplier is implicated in espionage or sabotage.

Data center sponsors who cannot prove supply‑chain integrity will face growing pressure from regulators, insurers, and investors who see hardware trust as a prerequisite for AI and cloud infrastructure resilience.

Engineering secure-by-design campuses begins with assuming adversaries will target internet‑exposed and OT edge devices. Security architects must design environments that prevent any foothold at the edge from escalating into grid‑scale disruption or safety‑critical failure.

Geopolitically motivated campaigns against energy infrastructure are accelerating. Recent Russia-nexus attacks on the Polish power system and Romania’s national oil pipeline demonstrate that state‑linked and criminal groups see energy and digital infrastructure as leverage points. Last December, actors linked to Russia’s Sandworm APT compromised remote terminal units (RTUs), firewalls, and communications gateways at Polish substations and distributed energy facilities.

This precedent-setting cyberattack—the first to directly target distributed energy resources in a NATO member’s power system—is indicative of the current threat landscape. Sandworm’s campaign underscores how fragile edge devices are and how vital it is to harden the gateways at the OT boundary. The first pillar of secure-by-design campuses is disciplined network segmentation that treats OT as a distinct, high‑consequence domain.

OT networks should be carved into functional and geographic zones—separating building management from generator controls, from battery systems, from grid‑interconnection protection—with tightly controlled conduits between them, enforced by OT‑aware firewalls and protocol‑constrained paths.

Hardware‑enforced unidirectional gateways and data diodes offer uniquely strong protection at key boundaries. Data diodes allow telemetry and process data to flow outward from OT to IT and monitoring systems while physically blocking any return path, sharply reducing the chances that a web-based intrusion can reach OT systems.

Data diodes should be placed at key demarcation points—between the data center’s OT and corporate IT, between on‑site generation controls and the broader campus, and at interfaces with utility systems—so operators preserve visibility without exposing those domains to bidirectional network risk.

A second foundational element of secure‑by‑design campuses is a clear, continuously maintained OT asset inventory capturing every PLC, RTU, relay, drive, building controller, gateway, sensor, and engineering workstation, along with its network location, firmware version, vendor, and criticality. Effective segmentation depends on knowing what you have and how it communicates.

Operators cannot isolate critical power and cooling functions, or confidently place diodes and firewalls, without understanding which devices participate in those functions and which paths they rely on. This inventory must fully cover the same class of gateways and field devices abused in the Polish grid attack.

When asset inventories are linked to configuration and vulnerability management, operators can quickly identify exposed OT devices when they are approaching end  of life or when new flaws are disclosed. A comprehensive OT asset inventory also enables security teams to quickly locate high‑risk remote access paths and prioritize segments for additional hardening.

Secure‑by‑design engineering mandates the  mitigation of accelerating cyber risks posed by remote access gateways and the mass-automation of industrial functions. Every orchestration platform, management API, and remote session is a potential high‑impact attack vector.  This threat model requires consolidating OT access through hardened jump hosts with strong authentication and just‑in‑time privileges; sharply limiting what automation tools can change on OT networks, enforcing strict segregation between automation platforms and safety‑critical functions, continuously monitoring automated and remote actions, and hardening configuration‑management workflows.

Lastly, secure‑by‑design architecture demands OT‑aware visibility that can actually see and understand what is happening on control networks. This means instrumenting OT segments with monitoring tuned to industrial protocols and behaviors, correlating alerts with asset context, and wiring those insights into playbooks that can quickly isolate, triage, and physically replace compromised edge devices before an intrusion escalates.

The threat modeling, procurement, and design best practices detailed here directly constrain the blast radius of geopolitically charged campaigns that threaten data center reliability and safety. Data center developers, operators, and investors need this systems‑level blueprint for building AI‑era campuses that remain resilient as the energy and threat landscape becomes more contested.

Banks and institutional sponsors are deploying trillions of dollars in construction, fit‑out, and power capacity on the assumption that AI demand will translate into durable, high‑availability cash flows. Underinvesting in cybersecurity directly threatens covenants, refinancing options, insurance coverage, and asset valuation. Outages, safety incidents, or regulatory findings will capsize the investment thesis.

The campuses that will secure the best financing over the next decade will be those that can point to their secure‑by‑design architectures, campus-wide OT governance, and defensible supply‑chain practices. In this intertwining infrastructure supercycle and macro OT threat environment, power usage efficiency (PUE) metrics and fast build schedules will matter less that proven security safeguards.

The stakes are escalating rapidly. Developers and utilities are pairing energy‑hungry data centers with small modular reactors (SMRs) and other non‑traditional power generation. These campuses will converge with the security and risk profile of nuclear and high‑hazard industrial facilities, bringing heightened  regulations and adversary interest.

SMR data centers fundamentally change the threat model. When nuclear systems sit alongside AI clusters, secure-by-design takes on a new dimension. Operators, investors, regulators, and security professionals must prepare for this convergence. The integration of compute and power generation creates a dynamic that demands the security rigor of both digital and infrastructure and nuclear facilities. The window to build these protections into design is closing.

Jeffrey Knight is Director of Global Critical Infrastructure Services at InfraShield. Jeff brings more than 35 years of experience in nuclear engineering and cybersecurity across the Department of Defense (DoD), SWIFT, the NRC, and the Department of Energy (DOE) National Laboratory complex.

[89] Cyberscoop - Proofpoint acquires Acuvity to tackle the security risks of agentic AI
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[TAM METİN - 580 kelime]
Proofpoint announced Thursday it has acquired Acuvity, an AI security startup, as the cybersecurity company moves to address security risks stemming from widespread corporate adoption of agentic AI.

The acquisition strengthens Proofpoint‘s capabilities in monitoring and securing AI-powered systems that are increasingly handling sensitive business functions across enterprises.

Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, but Ryan Kalember, Proofpoint’s chief strategy officer, told CyberScoop that the acquisition was beyond a pure “technology acquisition,” with Acuvity’s engineering team slated to join the California-based company.

Acuvity specializes in visibility and governance for AI applications, including the ability to track how employees and automated systems interact with external AI services and protect custom AI models developed within organizations. The startup’s platform monitors AI usage across multiple deployments, from web browsers to specialized infrastructure including Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and locally installed AI tools.

The deal reflects growing concern among enterprises about security gaps created as organizations deploy agentic AI across departments, like software development, customer support, finance, and legal operations. These systems increasingly access sensitive data and execute tasks previously handled exclusively by humans.

Additionally, AI-specific attack vectors such as prompt injection and model manipulation have emerged as potential threats that traditional cybersecurity tools were not designed to address.

Kalember said CISOs are seeing the potential risk combined with agentic AI growth, and are sensing the need to maintain governance without impeding innovation, particularly as the pace of AI adoption has outstripped many companies’ ability to secure these systems effectively.

“It has definitely been a pivot from, ‘I got to be able to stop prompt injection’ to ‘I have to be able to figure out what the AI is even doing,’” he told CyberScoop.

Last May, Proofpoint acquired Hornetsecurity Group, a Germany-based provider of Microsoft 365 security services, in a deal reportedly valued at more than $1 billion. Kalember told CyberScoop he sees Acuvity helping small- and medium-sized organizations that leverage Hornetsecurity’s offerings to boost its AI security.

“That is going to be a world in which, independent of the size of the organization, they are going to very much leverage AI, and some of that will be built into the tools like M365 that is tightly coupled with the Hornetsecurity architecture,” Kalember said.The acquisition follows a theme within the industry where larger security companies are buying AI-focused security startups. Just last week, data security firm Varonis acquired AI security firm AllTrue.ai for $150 million.

[90] Cyberscoop - Apple discloses first actively exploited zero-day of 2026
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Thu, 12 Feb 2026 23:48:20 +0000

[TAM METİN - 534 kelime]
Apple disclosed a zero-day vulnerability Wednesday that the vendor warned was previously “exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals,” the company said in a security update.

The memory-corruption vulnerability — CVE-2026-20700 — affects iPhones and iPads and was exploited on devices running versions of iOS before iOS 26. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency added the defect to its known exploited vulnerabilities catalog Thursday.

The disclosure marks the first zero-day reported by Apple since late 2025, and the first Apple defect flagged as actively exploited by CISA this year.

“An attacker with memory write capability may be able to execute arbitrary code,” the company said.

Apple, which typically shares limited details about in-the-wild exploitation of zero-days, noted the latest zero-day, similar to others it disclosed last year, was exploited by sophisticated attackers targeting distinct people.

The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment and did not describe the nature or objectives of the attacks.

Caitlin Condon, vice president of security research at VulnCheck, said the zero-day was likely exploited as part of a highly targeted spyware or surveillance attack on a very small number of individuals’ devices.

The zero-day vulnerability, which was discovered by Google Threat Intelligence Group, affects dyld, Apple’s open-source dynamic link editor that acts as a core system component to securely load applications on users’ devices.

Apple said a pair of additional vulnerabilities affecting WebKit — CVE-2025-14174 and CVE-2025-43529 — were previously disclosed in response to attacks involving CVE-2026-20700.

The company did not describe how the three vulnerabilities are related, but previously noted CVE-2025-43529 was “exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals.”

All three of the memory-corruption defects affect mobile operating systems, “where sophisticated zero-day attacks are commonly employed to surveil individuals, whether those are political dissidents, journalists, public figures or other high-value targets,” Condon said.

“Memory-corruption exploits are also commonly seen in sophisticated attacks, as they’re tricky to exploit reliably but provide elevated access,” she added.

Apple’s security updates for iOS 26.3 and iPadOS 26.3 addresses 38 vulnerabilities total, but CVE-2026-20700 is the only defect it disclosed as actively exploited prior to public disclosure.

Adidas investigates third-party data breach after criminals claim they pwned the sportswear giant

'Potential data protection incident' at an 'independent licensing partner,' we're told

Adidas has confirmed it is investigating a third-party breach at one of its partner companies after digital thieves claimed they stole information and technical data from the German sportswear giant.

"We have been made aware of a potential data protection incident at one of our independent licensing partners and distributor for martial arts products," an Adidas spokesperson told The Register. "This is an independent company with its own IT systems."

Adidas declined to answer our questions about when the compromise occurred, or what information the crooks pilfered during the intrusion. The spokesperson added that there's "no indication that the adidas IT infrastructure, our own e-commerce platforms, or any of our consumer data are affected by the incident."

Allegations of an incident at Adidas emerged on February 16, when someone claiming to be the Lapsus$ Group posted on BreachForums (screenshot shared here on Daily Dark Web) that they compromised the sportswear giant’s extranet. According to the crooks, the stolen files – 815,000 rows of information – allegedly include: first and last names, email addresses, passwords, birthdays, company names, and "a lot of technical data."

This latest breach follows a similar, third-party security incident last year affecting the sportswear multinational in May 2025. As we reported at the time, Adidas notified customers that some of their data was stolen after an "unauthorized" person swiped it from a "third-party customer service provider."

Adidas confirms criminals stole data from customer service provider

Oh, great. Three notorious cybercrime gangs appear to be collaborating

ShinyHunters allegedly drove off with 1.7M CarGurus records

Fraudster hacked hotel system, paid 1 cent for luxury rooms, Spanish cops say

Lapsus$ is a chaotic crew of teens and young people that gained notoriety during a 2021-2022 crime spree. The gang broke into and attempted to extort telecoms giant BT, Nvidia, Microsoft, Samsung, Vodafone, fintech firm Revolut, and Okta, using a mix of phone-based social engineering, SIM swapping, and even paying employees of target organizations for access to credentials and multi-factor authentication (MFA) codes.

In March 2022, UK police arrested and then released seven people, aged 16 to 21, for their alleged role in Lapsus$ activities. Police re-arrested and charged two of the teens for their involvement with the cybercrime gang later that month.

More recently, in early August 2025, the crew – or at least some of its members – joined a cybercrime collective with Scattered Spider and ShinyHunters, operating under the name Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters. Two months later, in October 2025, the extortion collab listed Adidas on its leak site, and claimed to have stolen more than 20 million sensitive records back in February 2024. ®

ShinyHunters allegedly drove off with 1.7M CarGurus records

Latest in a rash of grab-and-leak data incidents

CarGurus allegedly suffered a data breach with 1.7 million corporate records stolen, according to a notorious cybercrime crew that posted the online vehicle marketplace on its leak site on Wednesday.

"This is a final warning to reach out by 20 Feb 2026 before we leak along with several annoying (digital) problems that'll come your way," ShinyHunters wrote in its announcement, seen by The Register and shared on social media. The digital crooks claimed the compromised files included personally identifiable information and "other internal corporate data."

CarGurus did not immediately respond to The Register's inquiries. We will update this story when we hear back from the company.

According to ShinyHunters, the breach occurred on February 13, and it was part of the gang’s code stealing spree in which they used voice phishing to obtain single-sign-on codes from users of Okta, Microsoft, and Google services.

The Wednesday posts cap a string of 15 breaches claimed by ShinyHunters and Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters since the beginning of the year, including penetrating two investment advisory firms, Mercer Advisors and Beacon Pointe Advisors, listed on Sunday.

The extortionists set a Wednesday deadline for both companies to negotiate and threatened to leak 5 million records from Mercer and 100,000 from Beacon Pointe. Neither firm has posted a breach notification, and they did not respond to The Register's requests for comment.

At least one of the companies allegedly breached by ShinyHunters and posted to its leak site in February has said the compromise is from an old raid. On Monday, Canada Goose told us that it was "aware that a historical dataset relating to past customer transactions has recently been published online."

The down-filled jacket purveyor, however, declined to say how old the data is or how it was originally stolen.

Blockchain lending firm Figure Technology Solutions was also listed on ShinyHunters' leak site last week, and according to Have I Been Pwned, the criminals stole nearly 1 million customers' records.

A Figure spokesperson told us that "an employee was socially engineered, and that allowed an actor to download a limited number of files through their account."

"We acted quickly to block the activity and retained a forensic firm to investigate what files were affected," the spokesperson's statement, sent via email, continued. "We understand the importance of these matters and are communicating with partners and those impacted as appropriate."

The company also said it is adding "safeguards and training" to boost its digital defenses, and offering free credit monitoring to all affected individuals.

Other recent victims include investment platform Betterment, Match Group (with dating sites Hinge, Match.com, and OkCupid compromised during the intrusion), Panera Bread, and car buying and review sites Carvana and Edmunds.

ShinyHunters previously told The Register that it gained access to Betterment's systems by voice phishing its Okta single sign-on (SSO) codes, and Panera via a Microsoft Entra SSO code. The criminals' spokesperson said the CarMax and Edmunds breaches were from earlier, unrelated intrusions. ®

Fraudster hacked hotel system, paid 1 cent for luxury rooms, Spanish cops say

'First time we have detected a crime using this method,' cops say

Spanish police arrested a hacker who allegedly manipulated a hotel booking website, allowing him to pay one cent for luxury hotel stays. He also raided the mini-bars and didn't settle some of those tabs, police say.

"This cyberattack was specifically designed to alter the payment validation system, and this is the first time we have detected a crime using this method," Spain's National Police told media outlets.

The man, a 20-year-old Spanish national, was arrested while staying at a Madrid hotel with a four-night reservation that carried a €4,000 ($4,716) price tag – unless you hacked the payment system, as this fraudster did.

According to the cops, he stayed at this hotel several times, costing the business more than €20,000 ($23,608) in losses.

Police began investigating the suspect earlier this month after an unnamed online booking website reported suspicious activity. The transactions appeared normal, indicating the man paid the full amount – at first.

Days later, however, when the site transferred the actual amount paid to the hotel, the payment-validation scam surfaced, indicating that the crook paid just one cent for rooms costing €1,000 ($1,179) per night.

Adding insult to injury, police said that the man also consumed mini-bar bottles and sometimes left those bills unpaid, too.

While he may be facing a free stay at a mini-bar free, unluxurious facility for his alleged crimes, we have an idea for his next big vacay, post-prison: an inflatable moon hotel.

The definitely-going-to-happen hotel, slated to open in 2032, requires a deposit of either $250,000 or $1 million. No word on whether GRU Space, the hotel's operators, have received any one cent deposits – yet. ®

[94] The Register - Deutsche Bahn back on track after DDoS yanks the brakes

Deutsche Bahn back on track after DDoS yanks the brakes

National rail bookings and timetables disrupted for nearly 24 hours

If you wanted to book a train trip in Germany recently, you would have been out of luck. The country's national rail company says that its services were disrupted for hours because of a cyberattack.

Deutsche Bahn, which provides rail services across different subsidiaries, said its website, including booking and timetable systems, were knocked offline by a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack.

The effects of the attack were first felt on the afternoon of February 17 (1545 UTC), with both its travel app, DB Navigator, and website, bahn.de, experiencing issues affecting countless travelers.

Both of these services were restored as of 1300 UTC on Wednesday, although the company imposed temporary limitations on these systems.

"Our countermeasures were effective in minimizing the impact on our customers," DB said in a blog post.

Despite The Register'squestions, the company did not elaborate on who was behind the attack, whether the perpetrators made contact with DB, or whether customer data was compromised.

"Deutsche Bahn has been and continues to be subject to attacks on its IT systems," the company said in an update posted hours after the initial service restoration. "The current attack is specifically targeted at DB and has occurred in waves.

"The scale of the attack is considerable. Our defense mechanisms are working. We will not comment on speculation regarding the background of the attack. We are in close contact with the federal authorities.

"Our top priority remains the protection of customer data and the availability of our information and booking systems, which are accessed via IT interfaces on other platforms in addition to bahn.de and the DB Navigator app by hundreds of thousands of travelers in Germany."

DDoS attacks tend not to be used by sophisticated cybercriminals. State-backed crews will often opt for malware that leads to destruction or data theft – depending on the motive – or simply exploit vulnerabilities and zero-days for persistent access.

Financially motivated crooks often opt for some kind of extortion, which involves ransomware or data theft, or a combination of the two.

While DDoS attacks can be carried out by cybercriminals of all stripes, they are most often deployed by hacktivists – digital nuisance-makers – and typically only last for a few hours before traffic tails off, as was the case with Deutsche Bahn. ®

[95] The Register - China-linked snoops have been exploiting Dell 0-day since mid-2024, using 'ghost NICs' to avoid detection

[TAM METİN - 880 kelime]
China-linked snoops have been exploiting Dell 0-day since mid-2024, using 'ghost NICs' to avoid detection

Full scale of infections remains 'unknown'

China-linked attackers exploited a maximum-severity hardcoded-credential bug in Dell RecoverPoint for Virtual Machines as a zero-day since at least mid-2024. It's all part of a long-running effort to backdoor infected machines for long-term access, according to Google's Mandiant incident response team.

The US government and Google first warned about this campaign last year after detecting Brickstorm backdoors in dozens of critical US networks.

Dell disclosed and patched the critical flaw (CVE-2026-22769) on Tuesday – but noted that miscreants had found and exploited the bug before it issued a fix.

"We have received a report of limited active exploitation of this vulnerability," a Dell spokesperson told The Register. "Customers are urged to immediately implement one of the remediations detailed" in the advisory.

According to Mandiant and the Google Threat Intelligence Group, which also published a security alert on Tuesday about the Dell zero-day, the suspected PRC-linked intruders exploited CVE-2026-22769 to deploy malware including Brickstorm and a separate backdoor tracked as Grimbolt, and in some cases replaced older Brickstorm binaries with Grimbolt, while also creating “Ghost NICs” on virtual machines to enable stealthy network pivoting.

"Analysis of incident response engagements revealed that UNC6201, a suspected PRC-nexus threat cluster, has exploited this flaw since at least mid-2024 to move laterally, maintain persistent access, and deploy malware including Slaystyle, Brickstorm, and a novel backdoor tracked as Grimbolt," said Google threat hunters Peter Ukhanov, Daniel Sislo, Nick Harbour, John Scarbrough, Fernando Tomlinson, Jr, and Rich Reece.

Because the full scale of this campaign is unknown, we recommend that organizations previously targeted by Brickstorm look out for Grimbolt in their environments

When asked about the scope of exploitation, Mandiant Consulting manager Reece, who co-authored the report, said Mandiant knows of "less than a dozen" organizations affected by CVE-2026-22769. "But because the full scale of this campaign is unknown, we recommend that organizations previously targeted by Brickstorm look out for Grimbolt in their environments," he told The Register.

New and improved backdoor

While the earlier versions of the Brickstorm backdoor were written in Go, and later Rust, it appears the attacker replaced these binaries with Grimbolt in September 2025, according to Mandiant.

Grimbolt, written in C#, uses native ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation to translate programming language code into native machine code before the application runs. It's also packed with UPX, an executable packer that compresses the native binary files produced by AOT.

These features make the malware less likely to raise any flags via static analysis, and enhance performance on resource-constrained appliances.

Grimbolt also provides the same remote shell capability and uses the same command and control infrastructure as the earlier Brickstorm malware.

"UNC6201 established Brickstorm and Grimbolt persistence on the Dell RecoverPoint for Virtual Machines by modifying a legitimate shell script named convert_hosts.sh to include the path to the backdoor," the Googlers reported. "This shell script is executed by the appliance at boot time via rc.local."

Plus, they note, the IR team discovered the Dell zero-day while investigating a victim's environment that had been backdoored by Brickstorm and Grimbolt.

Security analysts spotted "multiple web requests" to vulnerable appliances using the username "admin" and directed to the installed Apache Tomcat Manager.

Google warns China-linked spies lurking in 'numerous' enterprises

PRC spies Brickstormed their way into critical US networks and remained hidden for years

China remains embedded in US energy networks 'for the purpose of taking it down'

Google patches Chrome zero-day as in-the-wild exploits surface

Dell RecoverPoint for Virtual Machines uses Apache Tomcat as its web server, and the security sleuths soon discovered that the attackers had been exploiting a hardcoded password in Apache Tomcat to then deploy a malicious WAR file containing a Slaystyle web shell.

"This is considered critical as an unauthenticated remote attacker with knowledge of the hardcoded credential could potentially exploit this vulnerability leading to unauthorized access to the underlying operating system and root-level persistence."

Additionally, after abusing the bug to exploit the Dell appliances, UNC6201 then created "ghost NICs" – hidden, temporary network ports on existing virtual machines running on an ESXi server – to burrow deeper into victims' VMware virtual infrastructure.

VMware did not immediately respond to The Register's inquiries.

The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and CrowdStrike both previously warned that Chinese attackers were targeting organizations' VMware environments and using Brickstorm for persistent access.

"State-sponsored actors are not just infiltrating networks," CISA's Nick Andersen, executive assistant director for cybersecurity, said in December. "They're embedding themselves to enable long term access, disruption, and potential sabotage." ®

China remains embedded in US energy networks 'for the purpose of taking it down'

Plus 3 new goon squads targeted critical infrastructure last year

Three new threat groups began targeting critical infrastructure last year, while a well-known Beijing-backed crew - Volt Typhoon - continued to compromise cellular gateways and routers, and then break into US electric, oil, and gas companies in 2025, according to Dragos' annual threat report published on Tuesday.

Dragos specializes in operational technology (OT) security, and as such, its customers include energy, water, manufacturing, transportation, and other critical industries. Unsurprisingly, these are key sectors for Chinese, Russian, and other government-linked cyber operatives to hack for espionage and warfare purposes.

In its yearly cybersecurity report, Dragos said state-sponsored crews haven't let up on their attempts to compromise America's critical infrastructure, with three new OT-focused threat groups joining the fray. This brings the total number worldwide to 26, and of these, 11 were active in 2025.

Additionally, an existing group that Dragos tracks as Voltzite and is "highly correlated" with Volt Typhoon, according to Dragos CEO Robert M. Lee, kept up its intrusion activities last year. This is the Beijing goon squad that the US government has accused of burrowing into critical American networks for years and readying destructive cyberattacks against those targets.

In 2025, Voltzite continued embedding its malware inside strategic American utilities "to maintain long-term persistence," Lee said.

"They [Voltzite] weren't just getting in and getting access - they were getting inside the control loop" system that manages utilities' industrial processes, Lee said in a briefing with reporters, adding that the PRC-backed crew's primary focus is causing future disruption.

Voltzite was embedded in that infrastructure for the purpose of taking it down

"Nothing that they were taking was useful for intellectual property," Lee said. "Everything they were doing and learning was only useful for disrupting or causing destruction at those sites. Voltzite was embedded in that infrastructure for the purpose of taking it down."

In one of these campaigns, the intruders compromised Sierra Wireless AirLink devices and used these to access US pipeline operations' OT networks. Dragos observed Voltzite exfiltrating operational and sensor data, and said the level of access the intruders had to the OT networks allowed them to potentially manipulate control systems. They also accessed engineering workstations and stole configuration files and alarm data, which included information about how to force stop operations.

In another Voltzite-linked campaign, Dragos spotted the crew using the JDY botnet to scan for public-facing Internet Protocol (IP) address ranges and VPN appliances across energy, oil, gas, and defense sectors.

"While no exploitation was confirmed during this phase, Dragos assesses with moderate confidence that the intent appeared to be pre-staging for future intrusions and exfiltration of operational data," according to the report.

New kids on the block

One of the three new groups that Dragos began tracking last year - Sylvanite - serves as Voltzite's initial access broker, responsible for weaponizing vulnerabilities and then handing off this access to Voltzite for deeper OT intrusions.

"Usually that indicates a government team and their national lab, or a government team and a contractor, or two different government agencies," Lee said.

Sylvanite exploits known vulnerabilities in internet-facing products from F5, Ivanti, and SAP to provide Voltzite access into electric power generation, transmission and distribution, water, sewage, and oil and gas organizations across North America, the UK, Europe, Asia and the Middle East.

"They're finding edge-device vulnerabilities - the things that a contractor or remote worker would use to get into operations networks," Lee said. "And within 48 hours of disclosure, they're reverse engineering [vulnerabilities] and hitting those devices."

A second group that emerged during 2025, Azurite, overlaps with China's Flax Typhoon and focuses on gaining long-term access to OT engineering workstations and exfiltrating operational files including network diagrams, alarm data, and process information for downstream capability development.

This group targets manufacturing, defense, automotive, electric power, oil and gas, and government organizations across the US, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region.

Malware variants that target operational tech systems are very rare – but 2 were found last year

Amazon security boss blames Russia's GRU for years-long energy-sector hacks

Finally, the third new group, Pyroxene, overlaps with activity attributed to Imperial Kitten (aka APT35) - the cyber arm of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).

Dragos spotted Pyroxene conducting "supply chain-leveraged attacks targeting defense, critical infrastructure, and industrial sectors, with operations expanding from the Middle East into North America and Western Europe," according to the report.

One such intrusion involved collaboration between Pyroxene and a group Dragos tracks as Parisite, which functions as an initial access provider into critical infrastructure orgs.

Pyroxene typically uses recruitment-themed social engineering against targeted individuals, interacting with victims via fake social media profiles before delivering backdoors and other malware. In June 2025, Dragos said the group deployed data-wiping malware against "multiple undisclosed organizations" in Israel around the time of the military conflict between Iran, Israel, and the US.

Don't discount Russia

Of course, China and Iran aren't the only nations targeting critical infrastructure in America and around the globe. Russia also poses a threat to Western water and utilities - along with any nations helping Ukraine in its ongoing war against the Kremlin's occupation.

Dragos does not attribute cyberattacks to any nations. However, earlier this year, it blamed the December 2025 cyberattacks against Poland's power grid on a group it tracks as Electrum. This group overlaps with Russia's GRU-run Sandworm offensive cyber unit - the crew behind the 2022 attack on a Ukrainian power facility and earlier wiper attacks that coincided with Russia's ground invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

In its new report, Dragos said that Kamacite serves as the initial access provider for Electrum, and it detailed a reconnaissance campaign that Kamacite carried out against vulnerable internet-exposed industrial devices in US water, energy, and manufacturing sectors between March and July 2025.

"While Dragos found no evidence of successful exploitation during this period, the scope and precision of the scanning reveal a meaningful evolution in Kamacite's operational posture," the report said. ®

Polish cops nab 47-year-old man in Phobos ransomware raid

Police say seized kit contained logins, passwords, and server IP addresses

Polish police have arrested and charged a man over ties to the Phobos ransomware group following a property raid.

The 47-year-old was cuffed after cops visited his apartment in the Lesser Poland Voivodeship, and looked through his devices, finding various artifacts that investigators believe are linked to cybercrime.

Officials said Tuesday the man's devices contained logins, passwords, credit card numbers, and server IP addresses that could have been used to launch "various attacks, including ransomware."

"After conducting technical investigations, it was discovered that the data contained information that could be used to breach electronic security," police said.

"Furthermore, according to information gathered in the case, the 47-year-old used encrypted messaging to contact the Phobos criminal group, known for conducting ransomware attacks."

According to an image shared by Poland's Central Office for Combating Cybercrime (CBZC), police seized one laptop, four smartphones, an array of payment cards, and a small amount of cannabis.

The man was detained and charged with creating, acquiring, and sharing computer programs used to unlawfully obtain information, including data enabling unauthorized access to information stored in a computer system.

If convicted, he could receive a maximum prison sentence of five years, police said.

The arrest stems from Europol's ongoing Operation Aether, which targets the 8Base ransomware group, believed to be linked to Phobos. It comes almost exactly a year since international law enforcement dismantled the 8Base crew, which was first assembled in 2022.

Bavarian police seized the group's infrastructure used to host its data leak site, while four arrests were made in Thailand.

Before then, Phobos's alleged administrator, Russian national Evgenii Ptitsyn, aged 42 at the time, was arrested in South Korea in 2024 and extradited to the US that same year.

The CBZC said Phobos had recorded more than 1,000 victims during its time on the ransomware scene, including hospitals, schools, nonprofits, and others.

Current estimates peg the total revenue generated by the group at $16 million, securing an average of $54,000 in ransom payments per attack. ®

Canada Goose ruffles feathers over 600K record dump, says leak is old news

Fashion brand latest to succumb to ShinyHunters' tricks

Canada Goose says an advertised breach of 600,000 records is an old raid and there are no signs of a recent compromise.

The down-filled jacket purveyor did not answer questions about how old the data is or how it was originally taken, but told us it relates to past customer purcahses.

"Canada Goose is aware that a historical dataset relating to past customer transactions has recently been published online," a spokesperson said. "At this time, we have no indication of any breach of our own systems. We are currently reviewing the newly released dataset to assess its accuracy and scope, and will take any further steps as may be appropriate."

"To be clear, our review shows no evidence that unmasked financial data was involved. Canada Goose remains committed to protecting customer information."

ShinyHunters posted the company's data for download on February 14 via their leak site. The criminals' advert for the data claimed there were more than 600,000 records, each containing personally identifiable information, as well as payment/financial details.

The Register reviewed a number of the records available online via a JSON file, and ShinyHunters' description of the data appears accurate.

It includes names and other usual PII data points, as well as partial payment information and order details, such as price and delivery address.

A cursory scan suggests affected individuals appear to be based across North America and Europe.

ShinyHunters has had a busy start to 2026: the cybercriminals now have their own data leak site, and have posted a number of high-profile victims this year alone.

Crunchbase and Betterment, two examples of these scalps, were raided as part of the group's targeting of Okta accounts through voice phishing.

Among the other victims are SoundCloud, Match Group, Panera Bread, Harvard University, and wealth management firm Mercer Advisors.

Last year, the criminal crew was linked to attacks on Salesforce, which led to the theft of data belonging to more than 200 of the company's customers, as well as SalesLoft Drift, a Salesforce integration that compromised various Salesforce instances. ®

[99] The Register - Google patches Chrome zero-day as in-the-wild exploits surface

Google patches Chrome zero-day as in-the-wild exploits surface

High-severity CSS flaw let malicious webpages run code inside the sandbox

Google has quietly pushed out an emergency Chrome fix after attackers were caught exploiting the browser's first reported zero-day of 2026.

The flaw, tracked as CVE-2026-2441 and assigned a "high" CVSS score of 8.8, stems from a use-after-free bug in Chrome's CSS handling that could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code inside the browser's sandbox using a specially crafted HTML page. In other words, a dodgy webpage could be all an attacker needs to get malicious code running inside a victim's browser.

Unsurprisingly, Google has rushed out fixes for Chrome with version 145.0.7632.75 for Windows and Mac, and 144.0.7559.75 for Linux, which the Chocolate Factory says will "roll out in the coming days/weeks."

Security researcher Shaheen Fazim reported the flaw on February 11, and Google acknowledged that attackers were already exploiting it just two days later – though it's staying tight-lipped on the specifics. The company has not said whether the attacks were targeted or part of a broader exploitation campaign, only that the vulnerability was being abused before a fix was ready.

"Google is aware that an exploit for CVE-2026-2441 exists in the wild," its security advisory stated.

Google said access to further details about the bug will remain under wraps until most users are patched, and potentially longer if third-party dependencies are involved, a standard move aimed at stopping others from quickly weaponizing the bug.

If this all feels a bit familiar, that's because it is. Google spent much of last year playing Whac-A-Mole with actively exploited Chrome bugs, ultimately patching eight zero-days across 2025.

The fix also lands days after researchers revealed that at least 287 Chrome extensions, with tens of millions of installs between them, were quietly siphoning off users' browsing histories to a long list of outside recipients – a handy reminder that data can leak not just through software flaws but through the sprawling ecosystem bolted onto the browser. ®

Infosec exec sold eight zero-day exploit kits to Russia, says DoJ

PLUS: Fake ransomware group exposed; EC blesses Google's big Wiz deal; Alleged sewage hacker cuffed; And more

Infosec in Brief The former General Manager of defense contractor L3Harris’s cyber subsidiary Trenchant sold eight zero-day exploit kits to Russia, according to a court filing last week.

We first wrote about this case in October 2025, when former Trenchant boss Peter Williams pleaded guilty to two counts of theft of trade secrets – but court records didn’t detail exactly what he stole.

That changed last week when the US Department of Justice published a sentencing memorandum [PDF] that frames Williams’ conduct as a betrayal of his employer and the US government, and the cause of significant harm to US national security.

Williams "made it possible for the Russian Broker to arm its clients with powerful cyber exploits that could be used against any manner of victim, civilian or military around the world," the DoJ said. The broker Williams worked with regularly provided exploits to the Russian government, the DoJ alleged.

Along with the damage he caused to US national security, the DoJ said that Williams' actions also led to the loss of more than $35 million for L3Harris and Trenchant, contributing to the government's call to sentence him to the maximum term allowed under federal guidelines.

The sentencing memo notes that Williams could be incarcerated for up to 108 months (9 years), followed by three years of supervised release. An Australian citizen, Williams has agreed to be deported to his home country after his prison term.

In addition to his time behind bars, the DoJ has also asked the judge to force Williams to pay $35 million in restitution and additional forfeitures of items linked to his crimes.

Ransomware gang turns out to be a couple of kids in a trench coat

A recently emerged ransomware group calling itself 0APT is just a bunch of liars who haven't hacked anyone, cybersecurity researchers have determined.

According to GuidePoint Security, 0APT's claim of having successfully attacked over 200 entities in the course of a single week in late January was a total fabrication, with most claimed victims having ridiculous names like "Metropolis City Municipal." As reports emerged that people thought the group was lying, its data leak site went offline before returning to life a day later with a list of around 15 high-profile multinational victims listed.

GuidePoint says companies on the shortlist also appear to have escaped infection by 0APT – the alleged victims found no evidence of intrusion after the group published their names.

GuidePoint believes there could be two reasons for the scam: Either to fool other cybercriminals into paying it for ransomware-as-a-service tools that don't exist, or to trick organizations into believing they have suffered an attack so they pay ransoms out of fear.

In other words, if 0APT claims to have hit your organization, it probably hasn't – but review your logs just in case.

Payment deadlines extended after actual ransomware attack hits BridgePay

People around the United States are getting a little more time to pay their local government bills following a ransomware attack that's taken payment service provider BridgePay offline for more than a week.

BridgePay provides payment services for local governments and utilities around the country – or it did until knocked offline on February 6 due to a ransomware attack. BridgePay remains offline at the time of publication and warns restoring services could take the better part of another week.

The company said attackers did not compromise payment information, but it still doesn't appear to understand the full extent of the incident. BridgePay said it will provide updates as it learns more.

At least one city, Frisco, Texas, has suspended shutoffs and late fees until the situation is resolved, but not everyone is so fortunate – Palm Bay, Florida's advice on the outage suggests residents ought to hoof it to a city building to pay what's owed.

Polish cyber cops have arrested a suspect believed to have attacked a water and sewage infrastructure operator.

The Central Bureau for Combatting Cybercrime's (CBZC’s) statement on the matter doesn’t say when the attack took place, but does reveal authorities apprehended the suspect in early February.

The CBZC said that the suspect gained unauthorized access to the critical infrastructure provider, logged into an administrator account and stole data. The data later appeared on the dark web.

Polish police claim that their actions in the western Polish city of Poznań enabled them to locate and delete the data and to make the arrest.

EU clears Google's Wiz acquisition

Google's acquisition of cloud security firm Wiz is one step closer to completion, with the EU last week clearing the deal.

The EU said that Google's acquisition of Wiz wouldn't raise competition concerns in Europe, as the likes of AWS and Azure offer their own strong cloud security packages.

"There are several credible competitors that customers could switch to if Google were to bundle Wiz's multi-cloud security platform with its existing products, or in case Wiz's platform no longer worked with clouds other than Google's," the European Commission said. The deal was also cleared by the US Department of Justice in November 2025.

Google previously tried to acquire Wiz in 2024 for $23 billion, but the cloudy security outfit rejected the offer. Google's second offer of $32 billion was enough to change the Wiz team's mind. The deal marks Google's most expensive acquisition to date. ®

[101] TechCrunch Security - Hacking conference Def Con bans three people linked to Epstein
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[TAM METİN - 962 kelime]
Def Con, one of the largest and longest-running hacking conferences in the world, announced on Wednesday that three people linked to Jeffrey Epstein are no longer allowed to attend.

The conference justified adding Pablos Holman, Vincenzo Iozzo, and Joichi Ito to its public list of banned individuals, citing the three as appearing in the Department of Justice’s latest release of files related to its investigation of the late investor and convicted sex offender. Def Con also cited an article in Politico based on emails that the three exchanged with Epstein.

Joan Vollero, a spokesperson for Iozzo, told TechCrunch in a statement that Def Con’s actions are “entirely performative, given that Mr. Iozzo has barely attended the conference in the past twenty years.”

“It was a rush to judgment not based on any investigation or wrongdoing by Mr. Iozzo,” the spokesperson said.

Representatives for Def Con, Holman, and Ito did not immediately respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment.

The move to ban the three comes days after TechCrunch reported that cybersecurity conferences Black Hat and Code Blue removed Iozzo from their official review board pages, amid new and emerging revelations linking the prominent hacker, among others, to Epstein.

Iozzo is a veteran of the cybersecurity industry who is currently the founder and chief executive of identity startup SlashID. He previously served as a director at CrowdStrike after the security giant acquired his cybersecurity startup IperLane in 2017. As TechCrunch previously reported, Iozzo interacted with Epstein between 2014 and 2018, including after the Miami Herald reported new allegations that Epstein had abused dozens of women and children.

Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to soliciting sex from girls and registered as a sex offender in New York and Florida. In 2019, the Department of Justice accused Epstein of trafficking, exploiting, and abusing dozens of underage girls. Epstein died in jail.

Iozzo previously told TechCrunch that his interactions with Epstein were “limited to business opportunities that never materialized, as well as discussion of the markets and emerging technologies,” and that he “never observed nor participated in any illegal activity or behavior.”

Prior to his startups, Iozzo was a research affiliate at MIT Media Lab, which was overseen by Ito at the time. The two appear in several Epstein emails together.

Joichi Ito was the director of the MIT Media Lab until 2019, when he resigned after it was reported that he was aware that Epstein was a convicted sex offender and that he and the university had extensive personal and financial relationships with Epstein.

Holman, meanwhile, is the general partner at venture capital firm Deep Future and describes himself on his website as “a hacker, inventor & technology futurist.”

Holman was in contact with Epstein since 2010, planned to stay at one of his apartments in New York City in 2013, and tried to help Epstein hide negative online news stories about himself.

According to an email, Epstein made plans to attend Def Con along with Holman in 2013, but it’s unclear if they attended. Def Con founder Jeff Moss said that as far as he knows, “Epstein never attended.”

Data breach at fintech giant Figure affects close to a million customers

The data breach that hit blockchain-based lending giant Figure affected nearly a million customers, according to a security researcher.

Last week, Figure confirmed a data breach allowed hackers to steal “a limited number of files” from its systems. The company did not provide specifics on what kind of data was stolen nor say how many customers were affected.

On Wednesday, Troy Hunt, a security researcher and creator of the data breach notification site Have I Been Pwned, analyzed the data allegedly taken from Figure and found it contained 967,200 unique email addresses associated with Figure customers.

The data also included customer names, dates of birth, physical addresses, and phone numbers.

Figure did not respond to a request for comment and did not respond to whether the company disputes Hunt’s findings.

The cybercrime group ShinyHunters told TechCrunch last week that it was to blame for the cyberattack targeting Figure. The group published 2.5 gigabytes of data allegedly stolen from Figure on its leak website, where the hackers shame their victims and publish stolen data if they fail to extort the hacked companies.

The internet today has a permissions problem. As non-humans — chatbots, AI agents, and automated systems — have proliferated on the web, so has the need to provide them with credentials, permissions, and identities. That’s one major reason identity and access management startups that help manage this new kind of digital workforce are raking in venture capital.

Now, a 35-person Israeli-American startup called Venice is emerging from stealth with fresh cash and a plucky claim: that it’s already replacing industry stalwarts like CyberArk and Okta at Fortune 500 companies.

Venice, founded just over two years ago, says it raised $20 million in Series A funding in December, led by IVP, with participation from Index Ventures, which led its earlier seed round.

Unlike many of its well-funded rivals — which include Persona (raised a $200 million Series D last April), Veza (closed a $108 million Series D last May), and GitGuardian SAS (raised $50 million last week) — Venice is tackling both cloud-based and on-premises environments, a technical choice that has made the product harder to build but positioned it to win over the large enterprises still running legacy systems alongside modern cloud infrastructure.

At its helm sits 31-year-old Rotem Lurie, whose path to entrepreneurship pretty much ticks every box on VCs’ checklists. The daughter of two programmer parents in Israel (her mother was one of the country’s first female software engineers), Lurie spent four-and-a-half years as a lieutenant in Unit 8200, Israel’s elite intelligence corps, before joining Microsoft as a product manager working on what would become Defender for Identity.

She later became the first product hire at Axis Security, an access management startup that sold to Hewlett Packard Enterprise for $500 million in 2022. Just before that acquisition closed, Lurie left to join YL Ventures, a cybersecurity-focused venture firm.

That brief stint at YL Ventures proved particularly instructive. “Every day, I used to meet a team of three 23-year-old boys,” Lurie says straightforwardly over a Zoom call. “Most of those companies build their technology to be acquired. The entire strategy around what problem you’re solving and how you penetrate the market — it’s a completely different approach.”

TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026: Tickets Live

TechCrunch Founder Summit: Tickets Live

To replace incumbents like CyberArk, which has long dominated the privileged access management market, Lurie realized she’d need to play a longer game. That meant building technology that’s both deep and comprehensive enough to support the complex, hybrid IT environments of most large enterprises.

The technical challenge ahead of Lurie went thus: Most identity and access management teams juggle roughly 10 different tools to manage who and what has access to corporate systems. Venice’s platform consolidates that sprawl into a single system that handles privileged access across on-premises servers, SaaS applications, and cloud infrastructure for humans and non-human entities alike.

“Tying everything together was what mattered to customers the most,” Lurie says. Indeed, Venice operates a SaaS subscription model, but Lurie insists it isn’t competing on price. “We reduce the cost, but it’s not because we go cheap on pricing,” she explains.

“It’s because we spare all the overhead [associated with many of today’s offerings], especially the professional services” — the consultant fees and lengthy implementations that have become an almost unavoidable tax for enterprise security deployments.

The bet appears to be paying off. Lurie says Venice is now “completely replacing” legacy vendors at Fortune 500 and Fortune 1000 customers, and cutting implementation time to just a week-and-a-half, from the typical six months to two years, thanks to AI-powered automation. While she declined to name customers on the record, she told TechCrunch off the record that they include a 170-year-old, publicly traded manufacturing giant as well as a global music conglomerate.

Cack Wilhelm, the partner at IVP who led Venice’s Series A, says Lurie stood out. “The problem with most cybersecurity pitches is everyone’s tackling something too small to ever be material,” Wilhelm says. “When you look at the massive exits — CrowdStrike, Palo Alto Networks — they were doing audacious things from the beginning. Rotem is the same.”

Wilhelm points to the urgency created by AI agents as a key factor driving IVP’s investment thesis. “If every individual is going to have tens of agents working on their behalf, and privileged access tools were built for a static world of IT professionals, we need our identity concept to adjust to that,” Wilhelm said. “Very often, when [companies] are breached, they’re breached by people simply logging in with someone else’s credentials. You solve that with just-in-time permissions that are scoped to the individual and the moment.”

Though crowded, the market seems eager for new solutions. Identity and access management spending was expected to exceed $24 billion in 2025, increasing by 13% from a year earlier, according to an industry group called Identity Management Institute.

Venice’s team is split between Israel, where R&D is based, and North America, where the go-to-market team operates. Notably, nearly half of the cybersecurity company is women, a rarity in one of tech’s most stubbornly male-dominated sectors.

Lurie’s co-founder, Or Vaknin, serves as CTO (he’s pictured with Lurie, above). The company’s investors include Assaf Rappaport, co-founder and CEO of Wiz, and Raaz Herzberg, CMO at Wiz and Lurie’s former colleague from their days as interns at Microsoft.

For Lurie, who says she has spent much of her career as “the only woman in the room,” creating a more balanced team wasn’t a calculated act. “You can never see yourself doing something if you didn’t see someone like you doing it,” she says. “This is something that attracts other women — to feel like they can be part of it.”

The question now is whether Venice’s two-year head start and early Fortune 500 wins will be enough to fend off deep-pocketed competitors as they chase the same enterprise buyers. Can the market support multiple winners? Or, will identity management follow the path of other security categories and consolidate around one or two dominant players?

Microsoft says Office bug exposed customers’ confidential emails to Copilot AI

Microsoft has confirmed that a bug allowed its Copilot AI to summarize customers’ confidential emails for weeks without permission.

The bug, first reported by Bleeping Computer, allowed Copilot Chat to read and outline the contents of emails since January, even if customers had data loss prevention policies to prevent ingesting their sensitive information into Microsoft’s large language model.

Copilot Chat allows paying Microsoft 365 customers to use the AI-powered chat feature in its Office software products, including Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.

Microsoft said the bug, trackable by admins as CW1226324, means that draft and sent email messages “with a confidential label applied are being incorrectly processed by Microsoft 365 Copilot chat.”

The tech giant said it began rolling out a fix for the bug earlier in February. A spokesperson for Microsoft did not respond to a request for comment, including a question about how many customers are affected by the bug.

Earlier this week, the European Parliament’s IT department told lawmakers that it blocked the built-in AI features on their work-issued devices, citing concerns that the AI tools could upload potentially confidential correspondence to the cloud.

[105] TechCrunch Security - Intellexa’s Predator spyware used to hack iPhone of journalist in Angola, research says

[TAM METİN - 964 kelime]
A government customer of sanctioned spyware maker Intellexa hacked the phone of a prominent journalist in Angola, according to Amnesty International, the latest case of targeting someone in civil society with powerful phone-hacking software.

The human rights organization published a new report Tuesday analyzing several hacking attempts against local journalist and press freedom activist Teixeira Cândido, in which he was sent a series of malicious links via WhatsApp during 2024.

Cândido eventually clicked on one and his iPhone was hacked with Intellexa’s spyware, dubbed Predator, Amnesty found.

The new research shows again that government customers of commercial surveillance vendors are increasingly using spyware to target journalists, politicians, and other ordinary citizens, including critics. Researchers have previously found evidence of Predator abuse in Egypt, Greece, and Vietnam, where the government reportedly targeted U.S. officials by sending the spyware via links on X.

Intellexa is one of the most controversial spyware makers of the last few years, operating from different jurisdictions to skirt export laws and using an “opaque web of corporate entities” — as a U.S government official put it at the time — to hide its activities.

In 2024, around the same time one of Intellexa’s customers was targeting Cândido with its spyware, the outgoing Biden administration sanctioned the company, as well as its founder Tal Dilian and his business partner Sara Aleksandra Fayssal Hamou.

Earlier this year, the Treasury lifted sanctions against three other executives tied to Intellexa, a decision that left Senate Democrats demanding answers from the Trump administration.

Dilian did not respond to a request for comment.

Amnesty researchers wrote in the report that they linked the intrusions to Intellexa by examining forensic traces found on Cândido’s phone. Amnesty said that Intellexa used infection servers that had been previously linked to the company’s spyware infrastructure.

Several hours after clicking on the link that led to his phone hack, Cândido rebooted his phone, which wiped the spyware from his device. Amnesty said it wasn’t clear how the spyware was capable of hacking Cândido’s phone, as his phone was running an outdated version of iOS at the time.

The researchers found that Predator stayed hidden by impersonating legitimate iOS system processes to avoid detection.

Amnesty believes Cândido may be just one of many targets in the country, based on their findings that they were able to find multiple domains linked to the spyware maker used in Angola.

“The first domains linked to Angola were deployed as early as March 2023, indicating the start of Predator testing or deployment in the country,” wrote the Amnesty researchers, who added that they had no evidence to determine exactly who hacked Cândido.

“It is not currently possible to conclusively identify the customer of the Predator spyware in the country,” read the report.

Last year, based on leaks of internal documents, Amnesty and media organizations revealed that Intellexa employees had the ability to access customers’ systems remotely, potentially giving the spyware maker visibility into government surveillance operations.

Those leaks, like this report, shows that despite its controversies and sanctions, Intellexa has remained active in recent years.

“We’ve now seen confirmed abuses in Angola, Egypt, Pakistan, Greece, and beyond — and for every case we uncover, many more abuses surely remain hidden,” said Donncha Ó Cearbhaill, the head of the security lab at Amnesty International.

[106] TechCrunch Security - European Parliament blocks AI on lawmakers’ devices, citing security risks

The European Parliament has reportedly blocked lawmakers from using the baked-in AI tools on their work devices, citing cybersecurity and privacy risks with uploading confidential correspondence to the cloud.

Per an email seen by Politico, the parliament’s IT department said it could not guarantee the security of the data uploaded to the servers of AI companies and that the full extent of what information is shared with AI companies is “still being assessed.”

As such, the email said, “It is considered safer to keep such features disabled.”

Uploading data to AI chatbots, like Anthropic’s Claude, Microsoft’s Copilot, and OpenAI’s ChatGPT, for example, means that U.S. authorities can demand the companies that run the chatbots turn over information about their users.

AI chatbots also typically rely on using information that users provide or upload to improve their models, increasing the chance that potentially sensitive information uploaded by one person may be shared and seen by other users.

Europe has some of the strongest data protection rules in the world. But the European Commission, the executive body that oversees the 27-member state bloc, last year floated new legislative proposals aimed at relaxing its data protection rules to make it easier for tech giants to train their AI models on Europeans’ data, drawing ire from critics who said the move caves in to U.S. technology giants.

The move to restrict European lawmakers from accessing AI products on their devices comes as several EU member countries reevaluate their relationships with U.S. tech giants, which remain subject to U.S. law and the unpredictable whims and demands of the Trump administration.

In recent weeks, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has sent hundreds of subpoenas demanding U.S. tech and social media giants turn over information about people, including Americans, who have been publicly critical of the Trump administration’s policies.

Google, Meta, and Reddit complied in several cases, even though the subpoenas had not been issued by a judge and were not enforced by a court.

Homeland Security reportedly sent hundreds of subpoenas seeking to unmask anti-ICE accounts

The Department of Homeland Security has been increasing pressure on tech companies to identify the owners of social media accounts that criticize Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), according to The New York Times.

This echoes other recent reporting, with Bloomberg pointing to five cases in which Homeland Security sought to identify the owners of anonymous Instagram accounts, with the department withdrawing its subpoenas after the owners sued. And a Washington Post story described Homeland Security’s growing use of administrative subpoenas — which do not require the approval of a judge — to target Americans.

Now the NYT says a practice that was previously used sparingly has become increasingly common in recent months, with the department sending hundreds of these subpoenas to Google, Reddit, Discord, and Meta. The subpoenas reportedly focused on accounts that did not have a real name attached and either criticized ICE or described the location of ICE agents.

Google, Meta, and Reddit have reportedly complied in at least some cases. Echoing past comments, Google said that it informs users of these subpoenas when it can and that it pushes back when the subpoenas are “overbroad.”

[108] TechCrunch Security - Indian pharmacy chain giant exposed customer data and internal systems
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Sat, 14 Feb 2026 03:30:00 +0000
Link: https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/13/indias-major-pharmacy-chain-exposed-customer-data-and-internal-systems/

[TAM METİN - 803 kelime]
A security lapse by one of India’s largest pharmacy chains allowed outsiders to gain full administrative control of its platform, exposing customer order data and sensitive drug-control functions, TechCrunch has exclusively learned.

The issue affected DavaIndia Pharmacy, the pharmacy arm of Zota Healthcare, which operates a large network of retail outlets across India. Security researcher Eaton Zveare told TechCrunch that he discovered the flaw after identifying insecure “super admin” application programming interfaces on DavaIndia’s website and privately shared details with Indian cybersecurity authorities.

The bug is now fixed, and Zveare disclosed his findings.

The exposure comes as Zota Healthcare rapidly scales DavaIndia Pharmacy’s retail business. The Gujarat-headquartered company operates more than 2,300 DavaIndia stores across India, including 276 new outlets announced in January, and plans to add another 1,200 to 1,500 over the next two years.

Zveare told TechCrunch that the flaw stemmed from insecure admin interfaces, which allowed unauthenticated users to create “super admin” accounts with high privileges.

With that level of access, an attacker could view thousands of online orders containing customer information, modify product listings and prices, create discount coupons, and change settings governing whether certain medicines required a prescription, the researcher said.

Based on system timestamps, Zveare said the vulnerable administrative interfaces appeared to have been live since late 2024. The access exposed nearly 17,000 online orders and administrative controls spanning 883 stores, he said, allowing changes to product pricing, prescription requirements, and promotional discounts. Zveare said the access allowed edits to website content that could have been used for defacement or disruption.

Pharmacy order data can be particularly sensitive, as it may reveal information about a person’s health conditions, medications, or other private purchases. Exposure of such data, even without evidence of misuse, carries heightened privacy and patient-safety risks compared with other consumer information.

“Customer information was linked to their orders,” said Zveare. “This includes name, phone numbers, email IDs, mailing addresses, total amount paid, and the products purchased. Since this is a pharmacy, the products being purchased could be considered private and even embarrassing for some people.”

Zveare said he reported the issue to CERT-In, India’s national cyber-emergency response agency, in August 2025. The vulnerability was fixed within weeks, though confirmation from the company took longer and was provided to the cyber authorities in late November, he said.

Sujit Paul, chief executive of Zota Healthcare, did not respond to emails sent by TechCrunch last month. The researcher said there was no indication the flaw had been exploited before it was patched.

Fintech lending giant Figure confirms data breach

Figure Technology, a blockchain-based lending company, confirmed it experienced a data breach.

On Friday, Figure spokesperson Alethea Jadick told TechCrunch in a statement that the breach originated when an employee was tricked with a social engineering attack that allowed the hackers to steal “a limited number of files.”

The statement said the company is communicating “with partners and those impacted,” and offering free credit monitoring “to all individuals who receive a notice.”

Figure’s spokesperson did not respond to a series of specific questions about the breach.

The hacking group ShinyHunters took responsibility for the hack on its official dark web leak website, saying the company refused to pay a ransom, and published 2.5 gigabytes of allegedly stolen data.

TechCrunch saw a portion of the data, which included customers’ full names, home addresses, dates of birth, and phone numbers.

A member of ShinyHunters told TechCrunch that Figure was among the victims of a hacking campaign that targeted customers who rely on the single sign-on provider Okta. Other victims of the campaign include Harvard University and the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn).

[110] TechCrunch Security - Sex toys maker Tenga says hacker stole customer information
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Fri, 13 Feb 2026 20:19:05 +0000
Link: https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/13/sex-toys-maker-tenga-says-hacker-stole-customer-information/

[TAM METİN - 728 kelime]
Sex toy maker Tenga notified customers of a data breach on Friday, according to an email obtained by TechCrunch.

In the message, the Japanese company said that “an unauthorized party gained access to the professional email account of one of our employees,” which gave the hacker access to the contents of the employee’s inbox. This access potentially allowed the hacker to see and steal customer names, email addresses, and historical email correspondence, “which may include order details or customer service inquiries.”

The hacker also sent spam emails to the hacked employee’s contacts, including customers, according to the email sent to customers.

Tenga did not respond to a request for comment and to provide more information, such as the total number of customers affected. The company says on its website that it has shipped over 162 million products worldwide.

Order details and customer service inquiries are likely to include intimate information that many customers probably wouldn’t want to disclose, given the nature of the products in question.

The company recommended customers change their passwords, even though it did not say that customers’ passwords were compromised, and to be vigilant of suspicious emails, especially coming from a specific employee, who appears to be the one whose account was breached.

Tenga said it took several measures after the breach, including resetting the hacked employee’s credentials and enabling “across our systems,” a basic security feature called multi-factor authentication, which prevents access to accounts with stolen passwords. The company did not respond when it was asked if there was no multi-factor on the email account prior to this breach.

Tenga was founded in 2005 in Japan, and is headquartered in Tokyo. Tenga sells a variety of sex toys, mostly for men. It’s unclear if the breach affected customers outside of the United States, given that the email came explicitly from Tenga Store USA.

Tenga is the latest in a long list of sex toy makers, such as Lovense last year, and adult websites, such as Pornhub last year and SexPanther in 2020, that have been hacked.

Hackers can turn Grok, Copilot into covert command-and-control channels, researchers warn

Permissive AI access and limited monitoring could allow malware to hide within trusted enterprise traffic, thereby accelerating adaptive, AI-driven attacks.

Enterprise security teams racing to enable generative AI tools may be overlooking a new risk: attackers can abuse web-based AI assistants such as Grok and Microsoft Copilot to quietly relay malware communications through domains that are often exempt from deeper inspection.

The technique, outlined by Check Point Research (CPR), exploits the web-browsing and URL-fetch capabilities of these platforms to create a bidirectional command-and-control channel that blends into routine AI traffic and requires neither an API key nor an authenticated account.

“Our proposed attack scenario is quite simple: an attacker infects a machine and installs a piece of malware,” CPR said. The malware then communicates with the AI assistant through the web interface, prompting it to fetch content from an attacker-controlled URL and return embedded instructions to the implant.

Because many organizations allow outbound access to AI services by default and apply limited inspection to that traffic, the approach effectively turns trusted AI domains into covert egress infrastructure.

Security analysts said the findings expose a growing blind spot in enterprise AI governance.

“Enterprises that allow unrestricted outbound access to public AI web services without inspection, identity controls, or strong logging are more exposed than many realize,” said Sakshi Grover, senior research manager for IDC Asia Pacific Cybersecurity Services.

“These platforms can effectively function as trusted external endpoints, meaning malicious activity can be concealed within normal network traffic, including routine HTTPS sessions to widely used AI domains,” she added.

Sunil Varkey, a cybersecurity analyst, said the technique echoes past evasion strategies such as steganography and “living off the land” attacks, where adversaries abuse legitimate tools and trusted infrastructure to avoid detection.

CPR said using AI platforms as C2 relays is only one potential abuse case. The same interfaces could be prompted to generate operational commands on demand, from locating files and enumerating systems to producing PowerShell scripts for lateral movement, allowing malware to determine its next steps without direct human control.

In a more advanced scenario, an implant could transmit a brief profile of the infected host and rely on the model to determine how the attack should progress.

A structural shift in detection

The research also points to a broader shift in how malware may evolve as AI becomes embedded in runtime operations rather than just development workflows.

“When AI moves from assisting development to actively guiding malware behavior at runtime, detection can no longer rely solely on static signatures or known infrastructure indicators,” said Krutik Poojara, a cybersecurity practitioner. “Instead of hardcoded logic, you are dealing with adaptive, polymorphic, context-aware behavior that can change without modifying the malware itself.”

Grover said this makes attacks harder to fingerprint, forcing defenders to rely more on behavioral detection and tighter correlation across endpoint, network, identity, and SaaS telemetry.

More significantly, this changes the tempo of defense. If attackers can dynamically adjust commands and execution paths based on the environment they encounter, security teams are no longer responding to a fixed playbook but to a continuously evolving interaction.

“This compresses the window between intrusion and impact and increases the importance of real-time detection, automated response, and tighter feedback loops between threat intelligence and SOC operations,” Grover said.

Security leaders should not respond by blocking AI outright, analysts said, but by applying the same governance discipline used for other high-risk SaaS platforms.

Varkey recommended starting with a comprehensive inventory of all AI tools in use and establishing a clear policy framework for approving and enabling them.

Organizations should also implement AI-specific traffic monitoring and sequence-based detection rules to identify abnormal automation patterns. Other options to consider include rolling out phased awareness programs. “From an architectural standpoint, organizations should also invest in platforms that provide unified visibility across network, cloud, identity, and application layers, enabling security teams to correlate signals and trace activity across domains rather than treating AI usage as isolated web traffic,” Grover said.

Cybersicherheit braucht Reife und keine Checklisten

CISOs wissen: Der Reifegrad ihres Programms ist für die Wirksamkeit der Cybersicherheitsmaßnahmen entscheidend. Dies erfordert eine entsprechende Führung.

Overearth – shutterstock.com

Cybersicherheit wird oft wie ein Spiel behandelt. Unternehmen jagen schnellen Erfolgen hinterher, haken Compliance-Listen ab oder klopfen sich nach einem einzigen erfolgreichen Audit selbst auf die Schulter. Auf dem Papier mag das produktiv aussehen, aber in Wirklichkeit schafft es ein falsches Gefühl der Sicherheit. Der CISO stellt in diesem Bild den Quarterback dar, auf dem die ganze Verantwortung lastet.

Cybersecurity ist jedoch kein Spiel. Sie erfordert eine ausgereifte Führung, langfristiges Denken und klare Verantwortlichkeiten. Alles andere setzt Unternehmen unnötigen Risiken aus. CISOs wissen um diesen Umstand, müssen ihn aber immer wieder in ihren Organisationen zur Sprache bringen.

Zu viele Sicherheitsteams verlassen sich auf Aktivitäten, die wie Fortschritte aussehen und dargestellt werden, aber das Risiko nicht wesentlich verringern. Dinge wie gelegentliche simulierte Phishing-Tests, auffällige neue Sicherheitstools oder die Erfüllung grundlegender Compliance-Anforderungen können ein beruhigendes Gefühl vermitteln. Das Problem ist, dass diese Aktivitäten oft nur die Symptome bekämpfen, nicht aber die Ursachen.

Häufige Beispiele hierfür sind:

Compliance als Errungenschaft statt als Ausgangspunkt betrachten.

Vorfälle als isolierte Ereignisse statt als Indikatoren für systemische Probleme behandeln.

Kennzahlen verfolgen, die gut aussehen, aber nicht die tatsächliche Widerstandsfähigkeit messen.

Glauben, dass Technologie Lücken schließen kann, die durch schwache Governance oder unklare Prozesse entstanden sind.

Das alles ist nur Scheinsicherheit. Es schafft Sichtbarkeit, aber keinen echten Schutz. CISOs sollten Risiken als real und gegenwärtig behandeln. Sie müssen Sicherheitsprogramme entwickeln, die wechselnden Bedrohungen, Personalfluktuation und unerfahrenen Teams standhalten können. Starke Führung ist nicht reaktiv. Sie ist stattdessen bewusst und informiert.

Erfolgreiche CISOs konzentrieren sich auf:

Menschen und Prozesse und priorisieren diese vor technischen Hilfsmitteln

Kulturelle Erwartungen und Verantwortlichkeiten

Klare Zuständigkeiten

Entscheidungsfindung auf der Grundlage von Cyberrisiken und ihren Datenanalysen

Langfristige Resilienz anstatt kurzfristiger Erfolg

Das ist der Unterschied zwischen einem Sicherheitsprogramm, das wirklich funktioniert, und einem, das nur Checklisten abhakt.

Der Wandel vom Spiel zum echten Programm

Der Übergang von einem reaktiven Ansatz zu einem ausgereiften Sicherheitsprogramm beginnt mit einer Änderung der Denkweise. CISOs müssen sich dafür entscheiden, aus dem „Spielmodus“ auszusteigen. Das Ziel besteht bislang darin, mögliche Probleme für ein weiteres Quartal zu vermeiden. Stattdessen müssen sie sich dazu verpflichten, Programme zu entwickeln, die echten Bedrohungen standhalten können.

Zu den wichtigsten Grundsätzen eines solchen Programmes gehören:

Compliance ist die Mindestanforderung, nicht das Endziel.

Sicherheitsmetriken sollten reale Ergebnisse messen, wie die Zeit bis zur Erkennung und Reaktion.

Jeder Vorfall sollte Erkenntnisse liefern, die das Programm verbessern.

Die Planung der Ausfallsicherheit sollte genauso wichtig sein wie die Prävention.

Die Verantwortlichkeit sollte geteilt, sichtbar und messbar sein.

Dies sind die Grundlagen eines ausgereiften Sicherheitsprogramms. Denn die Notwendigkeit wird jeden Tag sichtbar, die Bedrohungslandschaft entwickelt sich mit einer Geschwindigkeit weiter, die jeden Checklistenansatz übertrifft. Hochprofessionelle Angreifer gehen zielgerichtet vor. Sie arbeiten zusammen, automatisieren und innovieren. Sie spielen kein Spiel, verlassen sich nicht auf Checklisten.

Wenn Unternehmen Sicherheit weiterhin als eine Reihe von Aufgaben und nicht als strategische Disziplin behandeln, werden sie ins Hintertreffen geraten. Sicherheitsvorfälle sind keine Zufälle. Sie sind das vorhersehbare Ergebnis einer unreifen Führung.

CISOs müssen daher die Ernsthaftigkeit vorleben, die diese Aufgabe erfordert. Sicherheit ist kein Spiel. Es gibt keine Auszeiten und keine einfachen Neustarts. Was Unternehmen heute aufbauen, wird darüber entscheiden, ob sie den Bedrohungen von morgen standhalten können. Eine Führung mit entsprechender Reife macht den Unterschied zwischen scheinbarer Sicherheit und tatsächlicher Sicherheit aus. (jm)

[113] CSO Online - From in-house CISO to consultant. What you need to know before making the leap

From in-house CISO to consultant. What you need to know before making the leap

The move from in-house CISO to consultant promises autonomy and impact, but it also forces security leaders to rethink both their skill set and their mindset.

What ultimately crystallized the decision was the thought that his impact didn’t have to stop at the edge of one organization. “I was solving the same problems repeatedly in one company,” he says, “when I could solve them for multiple companies simultaneously, multiplying my impact and helping more businesses grow through pragmatic security leadership.”

In August 2025, Kokhreidze launched his consulting business, Mandos. But he’s careful not to romanticize the move. “It’s important to stay realistic,” he says. Going solo takes time and patience. It means figuring out where you can be most useful. And being willing to stay flexible. “You have to be ready to pivot when you have new ideas, or when things don’t work out,” he says.

Like Kokhreidze, a growing number of CISOs are either moving into consulting roles or seriously considering it. The appeal is easy to see: more flexibility and quicker learning, alongside steady demand for experienced security leaders.

Some of these professionals work as virtual CISOs (vCISOs), advising companies from a distance. Others operate as fractional CISOs, embedding into the organization one or two days a week.

“Consulting gives me more autonomy and control over how I work, while still letting me apply the same strategic approach to improving resilience, governance, and practical security execution,” says Antanas Kedys, founder and CEO at ACyber. He made the shift from an in-house CISO role to consulting in 2022, because he wanted to grow and work across different environments.

When a CISO transitions into consulting, their role changes in ways that aren’t always obvious at first. The new job means sharpening some skills, building entirely new ones and, perhaps hardest of all, learning to let go of control.

“As a CISO, you can mandate; as a consultant, you can only influence,” says Nigel Gibbons, director and senior advisor at NCC Group.

How to prepare to make the leap from security leader to consultant

Long before stepping away from a full-time role, Kokhreidze and other security leaders tried to quietly plan ahead. They tested ideas, built visibility, reconnected with old contacts, and began mapping out who their potential clients might be. The list of potential should be a long one, because few conversations tend to turn into actual work.

“If someone is not asking you right now to consult for them, it can take 12-18 months before you land your first client,” says Carlota Sage. She held a part-time CISO role at a nonprofit before transitioning into vCISO work. Later, she went on to found Pocket CISO, which provides cybersecurity services to early-stage startups and small organizations.

Kokhreidze agrees with her. For a smoother transition, he suggests CISOs line up their first clients while they’re still employed. Otherwise, he says, it can take a long time to build momentum. And the pressure to make it work can quickly turn into panic. In that moment, security professionals may start “underpricing themselves because they need money immediately,” he says. Once rates are set out of desperation, they’re often hard to reset without straining the relationship.

Other CISOs-turned-consultants also emphasize preparation. Kedys, for instance, stresses the need for a go-to-market focus. “Decide who you want to advise (industry, company size, maturity), what problems you’ll solve, and why you’re credible for that,” he says. “The combination of strong soft skills and a clear focus — who, how, and why — is the best starting point for a successful transition.”

Gibbons adds that consulting should grow out of a CISO’s existing experience. He suggests treating that experience as a set of real-world case studies worth talking about, capturing the decisions, the trade-offs, what went wrong and what worked. He also stresses the importance of building relationships beyond the security function, including legal teams, auditors, regulators and investors. “Consulting is ultimately a trust-based profession not a technical one,” he adds.

Skills that carry over into consulting

Many of the skills CISOs honed inside large organizations translate directly to the new consulting job, while others suddenly matter more than they ever did before. In addition to technical skills, it is often the practical ones that prove most valuable.

The ability to prioritize — sharpened over years in a CISO role — becomes especially important in consulting. “It matters more than anything else,” Gibbons argues, because in consulting environments resources are often limited. Consultants are paid not to know everything, but to know what matters most, which risks to tackle first, and which problems can safely wait.

Crisis management is another essential skill. Paired with hands-on knowledge of cybersecurity processes and best practices, it gives former CISOs a real advantage as they move into consulting. Kedys highlights stress management: the ability to stay calm, focused and keep execution moving under pressure, which is just as valuable outside the enterprise as it ever was inside.

But if there’s one translatable skill that everyone talks about, that skill is communication. “All of your security and compliance knowledge is wasted if you cannot communicate to a business audience,” Sage says.

Kokhreidze agrees. Instead of leading with controls, tools or technical details, he focuses on what CTOs and other business leaders actually care about: outcomes. He talks about how security protects revenue, supports resilience, or builds confidence with regulators.

New skills needed in the toolkit

As CISOs move into consulting, they quickly discover they need new skills as well, some of which they may have deliberately avoided in their in-house roles. Chief among them is sales. “Eighty percent of your work is actually selling yourself,” says Kokhreidze. “You are first a business, and CISO second.”

And being a business is time-consuming. Consultants must juggle personal branding, marketing, accounting, and writing. Writing and online presence, in particular, matter because done well, they signal credibility and give current and future clients a sense of how a CISO thinks.

The multiple roles consultants have to play — switching between delivery, sales, marketing and admin while juggling several clients — come with a real mental toll. For many former in-house executives, adjusting to that constant context switching is one of the hardest parts of leaving a structured organization behind. “If you’re running your own consulting firm, context switching can be a struggle,” Sage says.

In time, many consultants learn that discipline matters, and that saying no is part of the job. “You must become comfortable saying no to work that dilutes your positioning or turns you back into an outsourced operator rather than a trusted advisor,” Gibbons says.

Setting the right price

Many CISOs know their value inside an enterprise but translating that value into a consulting price is a different challenge altogether. It requires a shift from thinking like an employee to thinking like a business.

“Skills are not different from a product,” Kedys says. “You just need to find the right product (in this case, the skill) and wrap it in a way a market will be most likely to take it.”

That understanding, he adds, comes from market analysis: observing how executives buy, what they value, and what comparable services cost.

Sage agrees with the idea of analyzing the market but says that CISOs coming from large enterprises and targeting small and mid-sized organizations often need to recalibrate their expectations. What feels like a modest rate to a global organization can be misaligned with the realities of smaller clients, particularly those buying advisory services for the first time.

When thinking about pricing, Kokhreidze took a two-way approach. He looked at the market and assessed his value. Then he set a realistic income goal and worked backwards, factoring in how many clients he could serve well. The result was a pricing model that favored quality over volume, a trade-off he knew the clients he wanted to work with would resonate with.

“B2B companies closing enterprise deals understand that professional security leadership costs far less than losing a single €10M+ contract to failed security reviews,” Kokhreidze says.

When setting prices, one of the most common mistakes is charging for time rather than for the value the consultant brings to the table. Early in his career, Gibbons priced his work by the day instead of by the consequences it helped clients avoid. Over time, he moved toward outcome-based engagements, such as board assurance, regulatory readiness and post-incident recovery, so clients can understand more easily what they’re paying for.

“Clients are buying judgment, not hours,” Gibbons says.

This approach, however, is not universal. Some more traditional organizations remain firmly attached to day rates. In those environments, shifting negotiations can be difficult regardless of the expertise being offered.

Potential mistakes to avoid

Ask experienced consultants what mistakes newcomers tend to make, and the answers tend to be consistent. The biggest mistakes are rarely about security skills. They tend to cluster around mindset, money, and figuring out how to show up in the market.

“The hardest lesson was realizing that being a great CISO doesn’t guarantee clients at all,” Kokhreidze says. “I quickly learned that professional expertise means nothing without strong sales and qualification skills, because you’ll waste months chasing companies that either don’t have the problem you’re trying to solve or aren’t ready to invest in fixing it.”

Gibbons sees a related issue: consultants trying to recreate an in-house role from the outside. They take on operational responsibility, running programs or becoming embedded indefinitely. “That erodes margins and credibility,” he says.

Another common misstep he points to is leading with tools, frameworks or certifications rather than judgment and experience. “Clients do not hire former CISOs for policy templates,” he argues. “They hire them to help make hard decisions with incomplete information.”

Even CISOs who plan carefully before making the leap often discover that the freedom of consulting comes with hidden costs. As Sage puts it, “Most CISOs consulting for the first time underestimate how much time and effort go into just managing your own business.”

[114] CSO Online - Notepad++ author says fixes make update mechanism ‘effectively unexploitable’

Notepad++ author says fixes make update mechanism ‘effectively unexploitable’

Hardening had to be done after a threat actor compromised updates with a custom backdoor.

The recently compromised update mechanism for the popular open source text editor Notepad ++ has been hardened so it’s now ‘effectively unexploitable’, says the application’s author.

Don Ho made the claim this week after the release of version 8.9.2 of Notepad++, which includes a double-lock verification that any download of the tool from this point on is genuine. The latest version verifies the signed XML returned by the update server in addition to the first step of the hardening in version 8.8.9, released in December, which verifies the authenticity of the signed installer downloaded from GitHub.

The application auto-updater has also been reinforced.

These actions aren’t foolproof, Ho admits in his blog, because it’s possible to exclude the auto-updater during the UI installation, or to deploy the installer with a specific command specifying the updater not be used.

In an email today to CSOonline, Ho said that no system can ever be declared absolutely unbreakable, “but the new design dramatically raises the bar.”

An attacker must now compromise both the hosting infrastructure and the signing keys, he explained, adding that the updater now validates both the manifest and the installer, each with independent cryptographic signatures. And any mismatch, missing signature, or certificate anomaly causes the update to abort automatically.

“This layered verification makes the update chain resilient even in the face of future infrastructure‑level compromises,” he concluded.

Another supply chain attack

One reason the compromise went undetected for so long is that only a small number of downloaders — far less than 0.1%  — were specifically targeted by the attackers, Ho said, and the attackers were very cautious. “Their goal was long‑term espionage,” he noted, “so they acted quietly and deliberately to remain undetected for as long as possible.”

Compromising the update mechanism of an application is a classic way for a threat actor to infiltrate dozens, hundreds, or thousands of organizations that unwitting then use the hacked version of the software. One of the most notorious examples was the 2019/2020 compromise of the update infrastructure of Solarwinds’ Orion network monitoring suite. Another was the 2017 NotPetya attack that spread around the world after a Ukrainian tax application was hacked.

The Notepad++ problem began with the discovery that the IT infrastructure hosting Notepad++ had been compromised in June 2025, and a custom backdoor had been installed in the application. In the highly-targeted attack, traffic from certain users was selectively redirected to attacker-controlled servers by the malicious updates. Researchers at Rapid7 believe a China-based group dubbed Lotus Blossom was behind the attack.

The now former hosting provider believes the shared hosting server was compromised from June to September of 2025. However, even after losing server access, the attackers maintained credentials to internal services until December 2, 2025, allowing the continued redirection of Notepad++ update traffic. With the release of Notepad++ version 8.8.9, and the security hardening, all attacker access was terminated. Version 8.9.1 had even more security enhancements, and this week’s version 8.9.2 instituted the double-lock process.

“Developers must plan for adversaries who are patient, sophisticated, and selective,” Ho said. Infrastructure is part of your attack surface, he pointed out; even if your code is secure, a weak link in hosting, DNS, or a content delivery network (CDN) can undermine everything. “Continuous monitoring and strict credential hygiene are essential,” he said, and application developers must assume that partial compromise is possible and design applications and their delivery and update mechanisms for failure.

And if there is a compromise, he added, rapid disclosure, detailed technical explanations, and prompt fixes help users understand the scope and maintain confidence in the project.

Jeff Pollard, who leads Forrester Research’s work on the role of the CSO, said the fixes “significantly reduce” the risk of this specific failure mode recurring. But, he added, no single change ‘solves’ all supply chain risks. Attackers can shift to other choke points such as build pipelines or signing keys, he pointed out. “The key takeaway is that Notepad++ closed the exploited gap and raised the attacker cost,” he said.

Small utilities like Notepad++ usually sit outside of procurement, inventory, and third party risk management controls, he said, which is why they are ubiquitous among technical users, and valuable targets for adversaries.

“Asset management and software inventory is a perpetual problem for enterprises, but this event demonstrates why it’s so important to understand all the software in your environment, no matter how big or small it is,” he said.

Douglas McKee, Rapid7’s senior director of vulnerability intelligence, said the Notepad++ supply chain incident underscores a broader evolution in how threat actors think about software trust and persistence. While updates to the Notepad++ distribution mechanism and the release of version 8.9.2 with enhanced double-lock update security help close the specific vulnerability exploited in this campaign, they do not on their own solve the systemic problem of modern supply chain risk.

“What this incident makes clear, and what organizations must internalize, is that supply chain security cannot be limited to source code and build systems,” he said. “Attackers targeted hosting infrastructure and update delivery flows outside of the project’s direct control. Only by reinforcing signature and certificate validation, and treating update infrastructure as part of the attack surface, can defenders meaningfully reduce exposure.”

Chinese hackers exploited zero-day Dell RecoverPoint flaw for 1.5 years

A suspected Chinese espionage group exploited hardcoded admin credentials in Dell RecoverPoint for Virtual Machines to deploy web shells and maintain persistence in enterprise VMware environments.

For the past 18 months, a Chinese cyberespionage group has been exploiting a prevously unknown vulnerability in Dell’s RecoverPoint for Virtual Machines, a VM disaster recovery solution. The flaw, patched by Dell this week, allows unauthenticated attackers to gain command execution on the underlying OS as root.

The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2026-22769, stems from hardcoded admin credentials for the Apache Tomcat Manager, which can be leveraged to deploy malicious WAR (Web Application Archive) files. Apache Tomcat is a web server for Java-based web applications.

Researchers from Google’s Mandiant team discovered the critical vulnerability while investigating multiple compromised Dell RecoverPoint for Virtual Machines instances in a customer environment sending out command-and-control (C2) traffic associated with two backdoos known as BRICKSTORM and GRIMBOLT. These backdoors are used by a China-linked APT group that Mandiant tracks as UNC6201, which is known to target VMware-related enterprise infrastructure.

Dell RecoverPoint for Virtual Machines is a data replication and protection appliance for VMware environments, which makes it an attractive target for this group. The new vulnerability affects versions 5.3 SP4 P1, 6.0, 6.0 SP1, 6.0 SP1 P1, 6.0 SP1 P2, 6.0 SP2, 6.0 SP2 P1, 6.0 SP3, and 6.0 SP3 P1. Customers are strongly encouraged to upgrade to the patched 6.0.3.1 HF1 version, but if that’s not immediately possible Dell also released a remediation script.

Attackers upgrade from BRICKSTORM to GRIMBOLT

UNC6201’s activities overlap significantly with another group that Mandiant and Google’s Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) track as UNC5221, which is known for targeting network-edge appliances using zero-day exploits. Other security companies attribute this activity to the Chinese state-sponsored hacker group Silk Typhoon or APT27, but Google believes this to be a different threat actor.

UNC5221 has compromised the networks of US legal services firms, SaaS providers, business process outsourcers, and technology companies over the past few years and deployed Linux backdoor BRICKSTORM and a web shell called SLAYSTYLE that has been installed on compromised vCenter deployments.

Both BRICKSTORM and SLAYSTYLE have also been observed in the new Dell RecoverPoint compromises attributed to UNC6201. However, the threat actor also deployed a new backdoor called GRIMBOLT.

“GRIMBOLT is a C#-written foothold backdoor compiled using native ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation and packed with UPX,” Mandiant’s researchers said. “It provides a remote shell capability and uses the same command and control as previously deployed BRICKSTORM payload.”

There is evidence that UNC6201 has been exploiting CVE-2026-22769 since mid-2024 to deploy the SLAYSTYLE web shell. However, the replacement of BRICKSTORM with GRIMBOLT did not happen until September 2025. It’s not clear if this was the result of planned iteration or as a reaction to BRICKSTORM being exposed by Mandiant and other security companies at around that time.

In addition to the payloads themselves, the investigation also revealed new techniques. For example, the legitimate shell script convert_hosts.sh that exists on these appliances has been modified to include the path of the backdoors to achieve persistence.

The SLAYSTYLE web shell, which is designed to receive commands over HTTP and execute them on the system, was used to set up proxy rules via the Linux iptables utility. Namely, incoming traffic on port 443 (HTTPS) that contained a particular HEX string was silently redirected to port 10443 for the next 5 minutes.

Another novel technique was the creation of temporary network ports on existing virtual machines on VMware ESXi servers to access other services inside the environments.

Charles Carmakal, CTO at Mandiant, described the technique on LinkedIn as deploying “ghost NICs on virtual machines to evade defenders” because it left investigators chasing network activity from IP addresses that no longer existed and were never documented.

Network-edge appliances have become a common entry point into enterprise networks for sophisticated attackers. These appliances are not typically covered by logging solutions, lack endpoint malware detection, yet contain troves of credentials and provide great pivot points to internal services.

Dell recommends RecoverPoint for VMs be deployed inside a trusted, access-controlled network behind appropriate firewalls and segmentation, not on public-facing infrastructure. Meanwhile, the Mandiant blog post includes indicators of compromise and YARA detection rules for the new GRIMBOLT and SLAYSTYLE payloads.

Millionen Chrome-Erweiterungen geben Browserverlauf preis

Schätzungsweise 37 Millionen weltweit installierte Chrome-Erweiterungen übertragen den Browserverlauf der Nutzer an externe Server.

2lttgamingroom – shutterstock.com

Ein Sicherheitsforscher mit dem Pseudonym „Q Continuum“ hat 287 Chrome-Erweiterungen entdeckt, die den Browserverlauf exfiltrieren. „Die Akteure hinter den Lecks sind vielfältig: Similarweb, Curly Doggo, Offidocs, chinesische Akteure, viele kleinere, unbekannte Datenbroker sowie ein mysteriöses Unternehmen namens ‚Big Star Labs‘, das offenbar ein Ableger von Similarweb ist“, heißt es im Forschungsbericht.

Für die Analyse entwickelte der Forscher eine automatisierte Pipeline, die Chrome-Instanzen startete, Erweiterungen installierte, eine vordefinierte Reihe von Websites besuchte und ausgehende Kommunikationen erfasste.

VPNs, Produktivitäts-Tools und Shopping-Add-ons

Die Untersuchung identifizierte zahlreiche weit verbreitete Erweiterungen mit riskantem Verhalten in Kategorien wie VPN-/Proxy-Dienste, Coupon-Finder, PDF-Tools und Browser-Dienstprogramme. Viele davon haben Hunderttausende oder Millionen von Nutzern.

Bei einigen dieser Erweiterungen handelt es sich um Pop-up-Blocker für Chrome. Darunter Stylish, BlockSite block Websites, Stay Focused und SimilarWeb. Website Traffic und SEO Checker, WOT: Website Security und Safety Checker, Smarty, Video Ad Blocker Plus für YouTube, Knowee AI und CrxMouse: Mouse Gestures.

Dem Forscher zufolge forderten mehrere der Erweiterungen umfassende Host-Berechtigungen (webseitenübergreifend) an. Dadurch konnten sie Navigationsereignisse und Seitenaktivitäten domänenübergreifend beobachten. „Wenn eine Erweiterung nur den Seitentitel liest oder CSS einfügt, sollte ihr Netzwerk-Fußabdruck unabhängig von der Länge der von uns besuchten URL gleich bleiben“, erklärt er die Logik hinter ihrer Kennzeichnung in seinem Beitrag.

„Wenn der ausgehende Datenverkehr linear mit der URL-Länge wächst, ist die Wahrscheinlichkeit hoch, dass die Erweiterung die URL selbst (oder die gesamte HTTP-Anfrage) an einen Remote-Server sendet“, ergänzt der Experte.

Verschlüsselte Exfiltration erschwerte die Erkennung

Zudem weist er darauf hin, dass mehrere dieser Erweiterungen versuchten, die Art der übertragenen Daten zu verbergen. Demnach wurden ausgehende Nutzdaten häufig vor der Übertragung verschlüsselt oder codiert, was eine automatisierte Überprüfung verhinderte.

„Die manuelle Überprüfung des erfassten Datenverkehrs ergab eine Vielzahl von Verschleierungstechniken: Base64, ROT47, LZ-String-Komprimierung und vollständige AES-256-Verschlüsselung, verpackt in RSA-OAEP“, erläutert der Forscher in einem weiteren Bericht. „Die Entschlüsselung dieser Nutzdaten ergab, dass rohe Google-Such-URLs, Seitenverweise, Benutzer-IDs und Zeitstempel an ein Netzwerk aus proprietären Domains und Endpunkten von Cloud-Anbietern gesendet wurden.

Die Testumgebung des Forschers führte Chrome in einem Docker-Container aus, sodass jede Erweiterung isoliert und konsistent analysiert werden konnte.

Der Security-Spezialist räumte allerdings ein, dass wahrscheinlich nicht alle Erweiterungen, die den Browserverlauf preisgeben, böswillige Absichten haben. Er stellte zudem klar, dass einige Fehlalarme manuell aus den Protokollen der von den automatisierten Scannern markierten Erweiterungen entfernt werden mussten. „Einige der Erweiterungen sind möglicherweise harmlos und müssen den Browserverlauf für Funktionen wie beispielsweise ‚Avast Online Security & Privacy‘ erfassen.“

Der Bericht zur Offenlegung enthielt eine Liste mit URLs aus dem Chrome Web Store und den Akteuren hinter diesen Erweiterungen als Referenz. (jm)

[117] CSO Online - Flaws in four popular VS Code extensions left 128 million installs open to attack

Flaws in four popular VS Code extensions left 128 million installs open to attack

Three of the four vulnerabilities remained unpatched months after OX Security reported them to the maintainers.

Critical and high-severity vulnerabilities were found in four widely used Visual Studio Code extensions with a combined 128 million downloads, exposing developers to file theft, remote code execution, and local network reconnaissance.

Application security company OX Security published the findings this week, saying it had begun notifying vendors in June 2025 but received no response from three of the four maintainers.

Three CVEs, CVE-2025-65717, CVE-2025-65715, and CVE-2025-65716, were formally assigned and published on February 16.

VS Code extensions are add-ons that expand the functionality of Microsoft’s widely used code editor, adding capabilities such as language support, debugging tools, live preview, and code execution. They run with broad access to local files, terminals, and network resources, which is what made these vulnerabilities consequential.

Unlike the rogue extensions that threat actors have repeatedly planted in the VS Code marketplace, these flaws resided in legitimate, widely installed tools, meaning developers had no reason to suspect them, OX Security said in an advisory.

“Our research demonstrates that a hacker needs only one malicious extension, or a single vulnerability within one extension, to perform lateral movement and compromise entire organizations,” the advisory added.

The vulnerabilities also affected Cursor and Windsurf, the AI-powered IDEs built on VS Code’s extension infrastructure.

OX Security published individual advisories for each flaw, detailing how each could be exploited and what an attacker could achieve.

How the attacks worked

The most severe flaw, CVE-2025-65717 (critical), was in Live Server, a 72-million-download extension that launches a local HTTP server for real-time browser previews. OX Security found the server was reachable from any web page a developer visited while it was running, not just their own browser.

“Attackers only need to send a malicious link to the victim while Live Server is running in the background,” OX Security researchers Moshe Siman Tov Bustan and Nir Zadok wrote in an advisory.

CVE-2025-65715 (high severity) affected Code Runner, with 37 million downloads. The extension reads execution commands from a global configuration file, and OX Security found a crafted entry that was enough to trigger arbitrary code execution, including reverse shells. An attacker could place it by phishing a developer into pasting a malicious snippet, or through a compromised extension that modified the file silently.

CVE-2025-65716 (CVSS 8.8) affected Markdown Preview Enhanced, with 8.5 million downloads. Simply opening an untrusted Markdown file was enough to trigger it. “A malicious Markdown file could trigger scripts or embedded content that collects information about open ports on the victim’s machine,” the researchers noted.

Microsoft quietly patched its own extension

The fourth vulnerability played out differently. Microsoft’s Live Preview extension, with 11 million downloads, contained a cross-site scripting flaw that, according to OX Security, let a malicious web page enumerate files in the root of a developer’s machine and exfiltrate credentials, access keys, and other secrets.

The researchers reported the issue to Microsoft on August 7. Microsoft initially rated it as low severity, citing required user interaction.

“However, on September 11, 2025 — without notifying us — Microsoft quietly released a patch addressing the XSS security issues we reported. We only recently discovered that this patch had been deployed,” the researchers added.

No CVE was assigned to this vulnerability. “Users with Live Preview installed should update to version 0.4.16 or later immediately,” the researchers suggested.

Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Taken together, the four flaws pointed to a broader problem with how developer tools are secured and maintained.

What security teams should do

“These vulnerabilities confirm that IDEs are the weakest link in an organization’s supply chain security,” the researchers at OX Security said in the advisory.

Developer workstations routinely hold API keys, cloud credentials, database connection strings, and SSH keys. OX Security warned that a successful exfiltration from a single machine could give an attacker access to an organization’s broader infrastructure and that the risks extended to lateral movement and full system takeover.

The researchers advised developers to disable extensions not actively in use and avoid browsing untrusted sites while localhost servers are running. They also cautioned against applying configuration snippets from unverified sources to VS Code’s global settings.

[118] CSO Online - Keenadu: Android malware that comes preinstalled and can’t be removed by users

Keenadu: Android malware that comes preinstalled and can’t be removed by users

Keenadu infiltrated devices by posing as legitimate system components, prompting calls for tighter controls on firmware integrity across manufacturing and supply‑chain pipelines.

There’s too little a user can do when hit with a complex Android malware that comes preinstalled on their new smartphone or tablet.

Security researchers at Kaspersky have flagged a multifaceted Android malware dubbed Keenadu that can ship preinstalled via device firmware, compromising users before they even complete setup.

“Keenadu serves as a reminder that mobile malware isn’t just a bad app problem anymore, but rather a supply chain and firmware integrity problem,” said Nick Tausek, lead security automation architect at Swimlane. “The most dangerous Keenadu variant is embedded at the firmware level, giving attackers effectively unlimited control and the ability to operate inside the context of every app on the device, which can turn a single compromised tablet or phone into an enterprise-wide data exposure risk.”

The researchers stated that the threat has already affected users across multiple countries, infecting over 13,000 devices as of February, as detected by Kaspersky. “The highest numbers of the attacked users have been observed in Russia, Japan, Germany, Brazil, and the Netherlands, but other countries have been affected as well,” Kaspersky researchers added in a blog post.

Preinstalled malware runs with elevated privileges

Kaspersky reported that Keenadu can arrive on new devices, already embedded in system software, allowing it to run with high privileges from the moment the device is activated. Because the malicious components are present in firmware rather than installed later as apps, affected users may have limited ability to detect or remove them through conventional means.

“Without any actions on the user side, a device can be infected right out of the box,” Kaspersky security researcher Dmitry Kalinin said through a statement in the blog post. “Vendors likely didn’t know about the supply chain compromise that resulted in Keenadu infiltrating devices, as the malware was imitating legitimate system components. It is important to check every stage of the production process to ensure that device firmware is not infected.”

Once active, Keenadu inherits trusted system-level permissions and operates with minimal visibility. The malware activates only under specific conditions, remaining dormant on devices set to Chinese languages or time zones and on those lacking Google Play Store and Google Play Services.

Embedded in core system apps

Keenadu can control legitimate system applications on affected devices. Kaspersky observed it inside critical components such as face unlock applications, raising the possibility that attackers could access biometric data. The malware was also found operating within the home screen app that controls the device’s primary interface.

The researchers warned that the backdoor provides attackers with extensive control over the device. Keenadu can infect other installed apps, install additional software from APK files, and grant those apps any permission available on the system. This enables compromise of sensitive data stored on the device, including media files, messages, banking credentials, and location information.

The malware can also monitor search queries in the Chrome browser, even when users operate in incognito mode.

Other ways of infection

Kaspersky noted that Keenadu’s distribution is not limited to preinstalled system components.

In some cases, the malware has also been observed embedded within applications distributed through Android app stores, where it can be delivered as a seemingly harmless download and activated after installation. Most of these apps are for smart home cameras, and they’ve been downloaded over 300,000 times, the researchers said, adding that all of those were removed as of the time of the disclosure.

Tausek says mitigation has to start earlier than “detect and remove.” “The way forward is to pair hard baselines like OTA governance and EMM policies with AI-driven prevention and containment that spots the behavioral fingerprints of backdoors before they turn into lateral movement,” he said. “AI models can continuously correlate mobile telemetry with identity, endpoint, and network signals to flag high-risk devices in real time and trigger automated guardrails like device isolation or the revocation of sessions and tokens.”

Kaspersky’s recommendations included checking for firmware updates if the device is infected, running a device scan with a “reliable” security solution, and stopping the use of or disabling the application if an infection is suspected.

Deutsche Bahn AG/Volker Emersleben

Die Störungen der Auskunfts- und Buchungssysteme der Deutschen Bahn sind nach Unternehmensangaben auf einen Cyberangriff zurückzuführen. Inzwischen stehen die Systeme wieder zur Verfügung, wie die Bahn mitteilte. Über mögliche Urheber des Angriffs machte der Konzern keine Angaben.

Schon am Dienstagnachmittag hatte es IT-Schwierigkeiten gegeben. Betroffen waren sowohl die Bahn-App «DB Navigator» als auch die Website bahn.de. Auf beiden Systemen können Kunden üblicherweise unter anderem Fahrplanauskünfte einholen und Fahrkarten buchen. Nachdem die Systeme am Abend wieder «weitgehend stabil» liefen, wie die Bahn mitteilte, gab es am Mittwochmorgen erneut Probleme mit den Systemen.

Bahn: Abwehrmaßnahmen wirkten

«Unsere Abwehrmaßnahmen haben gegriffen, um die Auswirkungen für unsere Kunden zunächst so gering wie möglich zu halten», teilte ein Bahnsprecher mit. Dennoch sei es zu vorübergehenden Einschränkungen in den Auskunfts- und Buchungssystemen gekommen.

Bei der Attacke handelte es sich nach Angaben der Bahn um einen DDoS-Angriff. Ein DDoS-Angriff (Distributed Denial of Service) ist eine digitale Überlastungsattacke: Dabei schicken tausende gekaperte Computer oder Geräte gleichzeitig so viele Anfragen an eine Website oder eine App wie den «DB Navigator», dass diese in die Knie gehen. Für die Nutzer sieht das so aus, als sei die Seite offline, obwohl sie technisch nicht zerstört wurde. Ziel solcher Angriffe ist es meist, Unternehmen oder Behörden zu erpressen, zu sabotieren oder politisch unter Druck zu setzen. (dpa/ad)

Discipline is the new power move in cybersecurity leadership

Turns out the real power move in security isn’t a bigger budget — it’s cutting the clutter and proving what actually reduces risk.

For years, I was fortunate to live many years, earning enough budget to deploy cybersecurity programs. I worked the same playbook: run a risk assessment, show a few quick wins, build a business case and the budget would follow. It took effort, but after a few cycles, the process almost felt predictable.

One recent experience changed everything. A new boss, a senior VP, came to me and said when I arrived to the role, “We need to be financially efficient. We need to reduce current-year expenses by 10%, absorb next year’s inflation, capture efficiencies that will materialize in the next year’s spending by 5% and do it in a way that creates efficiencies to self-fund new initiatives.”

I thought back to all the industry reports from Gartner, IDC and others consistently pointing to year-over-year increases in cybersecurity spending, often in the high single or double digits. Then, I was being told to cut, not grow. At first, I pushed back. Then I saw the chance to do something different. Instead of fighting the numbers, I started looking for ways to make the team more effective with less. That shift opened up new options I had never considered before.

When we talk about security, we usually don’t think about reducing controls, costs or teams, so we see anything that isn’t directly related to the “risk mitigation mission” as a distraction. We are trained to add, not subtract. When money is easy, we pile on tools, grow teams and chase every new risk. But abundance hides waste. I have seen controls that no one uses, vendors that no one checks, dashboards that gather dust and teams that overlap. The moment the budget tightens, all that clutter stands out. That’s when you find out what really matters and where management earns its keep.

Efficiency as a leadership language

Under financial constraints, the CISO’s mandate shifts from acquisition to capital allocation, where the central question becomes which actions materially reduce risk exposure and how efficiently he is doing his job, while considering financial discipline.

The security roadmap should be managed as a portfolio of investments, with each control evaluated for its cost, efficiency and loss avoidance. To improve clarity and aid decision-making, consider mapping controls onto a simple cost-versus-effectiveness matrix, with the size of each element indicating the risk the control removes from the overall portfolio. This visualization highlights which investments deliver meaningful risk reduction per dollar and which ones consume resources with limited impact.

Credibility is established not by defending every control, but by making informed choices and prioritizing those that deliver measurable risk reduction. Redirecting resources from lower-impact initiatives to those with higher risk reduction is an act of stewardship. When we articulate trade-offs in financial terms and demonstrate the impact on loss exposure and cash flow earns trust more rapidly than one who simply requests additional funding.

How to do more with less

1. Review contracts, renegotiate them or change the operations to a new partner

Scope, service-level agreements and performance metrics should be revisited because many contracts were established under different risk profiles, urgency and pricing conditions. Modernizing contracts to focus on outcomes rather than activities, revalidating pricing and service assumptions where competition exists and trading scope for measurable performance can generate structural savings. Locking multi-year terms when pricing and dependency risk are favorable, or using shorter renewals when market leverage is present, further supports efficiency gains.

I remember sitting with the team, looking at a contract that had been signed right after a major cyber event. Over the years, it had grown fatter with eleven amendments, each one a quick fix for the latest emergency. We went back to the beginning, checked what risks we had in mind, how the service was actually used and what we were really getting. It turned out we were paying for much more than we needed. By going through the details together, we found we could get a better level of protection while still funding an upgrade to a new-generation SIEM platform. In other cases, we just reviewed contracts and kept the same partner with scope changes.

2. Automate the routine

Time is often the most constrained resource in cybersecurity. Automating routine processes such as triage, ticketing, patch workflows, gap analysis, report creation and standard response playbooks reduces unit cost per incident and frees up skilled talent for higher-value work. Automation should be a deliberate effort to eliminate repetitive manual tasks and increase consistency at scale.

We started with the basics: automating the reports and coordination work that always seemed to eat up our time. Instead of building every report by hand, we set up simple flows with tools like Power Automate and Power BI. Suddenly, report generation that had taken hours was completed in minutes and mistakes dropped off. Our playbooks handled the routine incident responses. The real win was seeing our analysts freed from basic tasks, able to devote their energy to real threats and decisions that required their judgment.

3. Cut administrative and non-core spend

Efficiency is not limited to tools and vendors. Administrative spend, travel, low-value recurring activities, duplicative reporting and non-essential services can quietly accumulate and inflate the cost baseline. By establishing a quarterly review of non-core expenses and making explicit decisions to discontinue low-value activities, organizations can capture not only immediate cost savings but also significant cumulative throughput gains. These small cuts, when aggregated over a year, can free up substantial sums, underscoring their strategic importance.

We looked past the obvious places—vendors and tools—and took a hard look at the small, recurring costs that quietly add up. Some subscriptions and services had made sense once, but now just sat there, barely used. I remember reviewing a code-scanning service and realizing we were paying for more than we needed. By trimming it back to match what we really used, we saved money right away, without adding risk. It was a reminder that sometimes, the biggest gains come from quiet, careful housekeeping, not dramatic cuts.

4. Restructure teams and outsourcing around value

Security organizations tend to evolve in silos, shaped by technology domains, incidents or vendors rather than by the risks they are meant to manage. Reviewing the target operating model involves deliberately reorganizing teams and partners around value domains, not tools. Value domains, or clusters of related risks, prioritize risk management alignment over technological segmentation. Consolidating overlapping functions, such as incident response, vulnerability management and threat intelligence across IT, OT and data protection, reduces handoffs, eliminates duplication and improves speed of execution. The objective is not headcount reduction, but the release of capacity and the better allocation of scarce expertise to the most material risks.

When we pulled teams together, we didn’t cut headcount. We just stopped letting groups like incident response and vulnerability management work in isolation. By focusing everyone on the same risks, we made it easier to respond and to deploy our experts where they had the greatest impact. We also took a hard look at outsourcing, combining SOC and MDR for OT, IT and data protection into one operation. That move cut costs, improved efficiency and lowered risk.

Many large organizations maintain multiple solutions that address the same risk domain. Vendor consolidation, rather than expansion, reduces vendor overlap, lowers cost and streamlines operations. The discipline is to standardize on fewer platforms, decommission redundant tooling and ensure the remaining stack is actively used and measured.

We tend to buy a new tool for every new risk we find in the portfolio and in many cases, we look for the best of breed solutions for every different risk we find, which could also be ineffective, so many tools from different vendors, usually not integrated among them and creating a huge amount of work to try to keep it managed and well operated.

The future belongs to the disciplined

I learned that leading with less means every choice counts. Deciding what to stop is as important as what to start. When we restructured teams, renegotiated contracts and automated routine work, we found real efficiency without losing capability. These moves were about discipline, not just cutting costs. Looking ahead, the leaders who can show risk reduction per dollar spent will set the standard. Efficiency is now a mark of leadership.

The next generation of security leaders will not be measured by how much they spend, but by the clarity and impact of their decisions. In the boardroom, trust comes from showing your trade-offs and sticking to them, not from chasing bigger budgets. This is not about cutting for the sake of it. It is about leading with discipline. Where in your environment can you test one of these moves this quarter and measure the outcome?

[121] Infoblox Blog - Protective DNS: Harnessing DNS as a Core Weapon in MSSP Cyber Defense and Incident Response
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Wed, 18 Feb 2026 17:51:56 +0000

[TAM METİN - 862 kelime]
For security operations center (SOC) teams and managed security service providers (MSSPs), the real challenge isn’t just responding to incidents but intercepting threats before they escalate. Attacks typically begin quietly, making early detection critical.

At MSSP Alert Live, Chris Usserman, Global Public Sector chief technology officer at Infoblox, urged a shift: make Protective DNS central to cyber defense. His point was clear—prevention, not addition of more reactive tools, stops attacks before incident cleanup begins.

DNS, when fortified with predictive threat intelligence, enables MSSPs to intercept threats earlier and at scale, making it essential for preemptive protection.

What Protective DNS Does

Protective DNS applies a security policy during the DNS resolution process. When a device asks, “Where is this domain?” the DNS layer becomes a decision point. If the destination looks risky, the lookup is blocked—the device never connects.

Traditional DNS resolves any domain (malicious or legitimate) with equal efficiency. It doesn’t ask “Should I honor this request even though the destination is known to be bad?” Protective DNS acts as a guardrail, creating DNS telemetry you can log, triage and investigate. Combined with predictive threat intelligence, you’re not just blocking known threats, you’re acting on active attacks earlier with better context.

Why DNS Offers High-Leverage Control

Chris challenged the “more tools equal more security” assumption. Despite massive investments in endpoint detection and response (EDR), extended detection and response (XDR) and firewalls, attackers still breach defenses. These controls matter, but they often act too late, after attackers have gained momentum.

DNS gives you an early intervention point. Most attacks require outbound communication, such as loading phishing pages, downloading payloads or connecting to control-and-command (C2) servers. Block that destination at the DNS layer, and you stop the chain before it builds. Fewer successful connections mean fewer alerts and simpler investigations.

DNS as the First Major Obstacle

Chris described a familiar phishing scenario: a PDF invoice arrives, triggers scripting and bypasses multiple defenses. Eventually, the malware must communicate, typically via a C2 channel, for instructions or additional tools.

DNS becomes decisive here. If the compromised host can’t resolve the required domain, the connection fails. That’s what “block at the DNS layer” means: removing the attacker’s ability to reach their destination.

Chris also noted that some malware actively hunts for security tools and disables them while maintaining “healthy” appearances. Endpoint-only controls become vulnerable. Protective DNS operates outside the endpoint, so attackers must still use it to access the internet.

DNS Telemetry for Faster Incident Response

When incidents occur, responders need fast answers: Which systems contacted the attacker’s infrastructure? When? What else did the host do?

After major campaigns are uncovered, organizations routinely review DNS logs to determine if they have connected to newly identified infrastructure. DNS telemetry provides early indicators of compromise (IoCs): what was requested, when, how often and what followed. This enables rapid triage and scoping. You instantly see if other hosts made similar requests.

Chris emphasized threat attribution, which involves tying DNS events to specific assets and their owners. This makes containment a decisive rather than a guesswork approach.

Beyond Domain Reputation

Chris was direct about the limitations of reputation feeds. Most require “patient zero”—someone gets compromised before the domain is flagged. That’s inherently reactive.

New domains appear constantly. Threat actors register and quickly abandon their infrastructure. Adding lookalike domains and pure blocklist approaches becomes unrealistic.

Pairing Protective DNS with predictive threat intelligence addresses this gap. Instead of waiting for reputation to “age in,” use earlier signals, such as newly observed domains and rapidly changing infrastructure, to make better decisions sooner.

DNS as a Channel for Exfiltration

Chris reminded attendees that DNS isn’t just a phone book—it’s a channel. Attackers hide data in queries and exfiltrate incrementally.

DNS is observable. Patterns such as repeated lookups to uncommon domains, abnormal query volumes or unusual timing are strong indicators for investigation.

Protective DNS and telemetry help identify these signals early, enabling faster containment.

Integrating Protective DNS into MSSP Services

Chris’s advice for MSSPs follows a managed-service playbook:

Position It as Prevention: Frame Protective DNS as baseline defense against phishing and malware, blocking attacks before they develop and reducing incidents requiring deep response.

Operationalize the Investigation: Treat DNS logs and telemetry as first-class data for incident response, enabling quick scoping, IoC hunts and early compromise indicators.

Alert the Ecosystem: Integrate DNS context into the broader security stack, including security information and event management (SIEM) and XDR, so that DNS-layer events appear alongside endpoint and network signals in unified investigations.

MSSP leaders and SOC managers should position Protective DNS strategically. Even strong endpoint and network controls benefit when DNS-layer policy provides the earliest threat interception and creates high-quality IoCs for faster investigations.

Start by mapping your incident response flow. Ask: Where do you already rely on DNS logs? How quickly could you block suspicious destinations at the DNS layer? How could predictive threat intelligence help you act earlier on brand-new attacker infrastructure?

[122] Infoblox Blog - IoT DNS Security and Privacy with UCL and Inria
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

If we think about our home networks, we likely have more Internet of Things (IoT) and Operational Technology (OT) devices than traditional computers, and within enterprise networks these devices perform critical roles in security systems, building controls, manufacturing sensors and healthcare.

University College London (UCL) and the Institut national de recherche en sciences et technologies du numérique (Inria) have been collaborating on research into the security of these devices for some time. Using a large IoT testbed these organizations uncovered serious anomalies in the DNS behavior of these devices.

In the DNS world, IoT devices came to prominence in 2016 with the attack on Dyn, a major provider of DNS services. They suffered a massive distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack, disrupting access to major websites including Twitter, Spotify, Reddit, GitHub and Netflix. The attack was powered by the Mirai botnet, which hijacked thousands of insecure IoT devices. IoT botnet activity continues, as recently highlighted by Brian Krebs’ article on the Kimwolf Botnet.1

While the “normal” (bad) DNS behavior of devices and those of compromised devices are not directly related, there is an overlap in some of the mitigations that points us to how we can move toward security-by-design in the manufacture and operations of IoT. This article discusses the risks identified by the research, how these might be addressed and the mitigations network operators can use.

Using a large-scale IoT testbed, researchers at UCL and Inria analyzed 30 consumer IoT devices across categories such as cameras, doorbells, lights, sensors and medical devices.2 The methodology included passive traffic inspection and active testing.

Key findings included:

No support for Encrypted DNS (DoH/DoT/DoQ): This means queries would be visible, which could lead to device fingerprinting and privacy issues.

Hardcoded DNS Resolvers: Some devices ignored network DNS resolver settings and instead used well-known open DNS resolvers such as Google’s 8.8.8.8 DNS service. If this is permitted on a network, it would bypass local security controls or those a home network service provider is delivering to its customers. Conversely, if a device has a hardcoded resolver as shipped it may not work if that open resolver is blocked due to network policy.

Poor Source Randomization: Devices used predictable source ports and transaction IDs, increasing the risk of cache poisoning and spoofed responses.

No DNSSEC Adoption: None of the devices validated DNS responses, making them vulnerable to spoofing.

Time to Live (TTL) Mismanagement: Devices ignored TTL values, causing erratic query behavior and inefficiencies.

Fragmentation Issues: Limited support for Extension Mechanisms for DNS (EDNS0) UDP message size led to inefficient handling of large DNS queries that testing showed could lead to operational issues.

Andrew Losty, a PhD student at UCL and one of the Internet Draft authors, presented research findings at RIPE 91,3 and the slides and recording of this are available here. As one example, the following graph shows the lack of transaction ID randomization in some devices, making it more likely to accept a spoofed DNS response.

Figure 1. Transaction ID results

Strengthening DNS Security in IoT Devices

To address the DNS-related vulnerabilities uncovered in the UCL and Inria research, we are working together on an Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Best Current Practice draft via the IoT working group. This is the logical place for this work as the DNS protocol is developed within the IETF and the IoT working group has a focus on the management and operations of the types of devices tested.

Manufacturers of IoT/OT devices need to ensure adherence to the following:

Compliance to encrypted DNS standards such as DNS over TLS (DoT), DNS over HTTPS (DoH) or DNS over QUIC (DoQ) for enhanced privacy, security and compatibility

Support for the configuration of DNS servers manually, via device management software, IPv6 router advertisements, DHCP and discovery of designated resolver standards; devices should not have hardcoded resolvers for security and operational reasons.

DNS source port and transaction ID randomization to reduce the risk of spoofed responses being accepted by the device

Devices honoring DNS record TTL values, perhaps with a maximum for operational reasons, with manufacturers also setting management domain records to appropriate values

Support for EDNS0 to improve device efficiency and not impact the operation of a device when responses exceed the traditional 512 byte UDP limit

Develop support for DNSSEC, for instance checking the Authenticated Data bit in resolvers’ responses; manufacturers must sign their public zones used for device management and any data collection

More details can be found in the Internet Draft IoT DNS Security and Privacy Guidelines.4

Network Operator Mitigations

There are broadly two network operator types where IoT devices are deployed: service providers of consumer networks, for instance the networks we have at home, and organizations managing their own infrastructure. The main difference from a DNS perspective is that a consumer may use any DNS server, while an organization managing its own network should restrict DNS traffic to its own resolvers for security and policy reasons. In the consumer case it is advantageous for the end user to use the provider’s resolvers and most home networks would do this in any case.

Operators can restrict networks where IoT devices are deployed to only query domain names in management zones via Protective DNS.5 They can see what these are via analyzing DNS traffic, but we are calling on manufacturers to provide these, either by simply publishing them or via the use of the Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD) specification.6

This means that the networks would be operated on a Zero Trust DNS basis, along the lines of Microsoft’s Zero Trust DNS.7 This mitigates against devices being compromised, including in the supply chain.

Where DNS resolution needs to be more open, such as on consumer networks where any device can be deployed, the network operator can still use Protective DNS to block malicious domains used in the compromise or control of devices.

Operators should have resolvers validate responses via DNSSEC in any case, but specifically in the context of IoT it will allow devices to take advantage of manufacturers signing their public zones.

Regulation Improvements

Having improved standards that are enforced through certification will move us to a more secure-by-design paradigm.

While organizations such as ETSI, ISO/IEC, ITU-T and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) have varying amounts of guidance on DNS security as it applies to IoT/OT, there are certainly gaps here. Developing a Best Current Practice Draft within the IETF IoT Operations working group will allow this to be referenced by organizations such as ETSI where work for the certification of IoT devices is ongoing.

As an example, provision 5.5-5 in the ETSI EN 303 645 V3.1.3 (2024-09) standard states “Consumer IoT device functionality that allows security-relevant changes in configuration via a network interface shall only be accessible after authentication. The exception is for network service protocols that are relied upon by the consumer IoT device and where the manufacturer cannot guarantee what configuration will be required for the consumer IoT device to operate.” One of the exceptions is for DNS.

This should not exist as a blanket exemption. Rather than manufacturers complying with just device security, standards should consider the wider security context, especially where it is in same manufacturer’s control. The ETSI standard states “To increase security, multi-factor authentication, such as use of a password plus OTP procedure, can be used to better protect the consumer IoT device or an associated service.” The multi-factor authentication service and infrastructure is outside of the device and the manufacturer’s control, whereas public management domains can be cryptographically signed, and devices can check if this has been verified—all within one manufacturer’s control.

The natural tension in this is keeping regulation generic enough to allow for developments in tech and to document intent or outcomes versus being protocol specific. This is where IETF Drafts and RFCs can be referenced to bridge the gap and mean standards bodies do not need to maintain specific detail on protocol compliance.

The message can be boiled down to manufacturers following the DNS standards we already have (as detailed in the Draft we published), helping operators by providing management domain information to secure networks, pushing the use of PKI to manage devices in the form of DNSSEC (we do this with certs) and regulators referencing this in their standards.

As we continue to work on the Draft, turning research findings into actionable guidelines, we invite you to join the conversation via the IETF whether you’re a device manufacturer, network operator or security professional.

If you are a network operator or security professional there are some practices in the Draft that will improve network security and you can help practically, for instance ask the manufacturers of the devices you use to let you know the management domains names so you can lock down communications to only those domains via Protective DNS.

[123] Infoblox Blog - Banners, Bots and Butchers: An Automated Long Con Targeting Japan, Asia, and Beyond

Over the past few months, we investigated cryptocurrency investment scam campaigns that combined two distinct fraud models: malvertising, which typically directs victims to fake investment platforms, and pig butchering, a scam that relies heavily on social engineering to gradually extract larger and larger sums of money from each victim over time. Evidence indicates the campaigns heavily target users in Asia, especially Japan. The financial impact can be significant, with individual victim losses related to this campaign alone of up to ¥10 million (approximately US$63,000) according to a December 2025 report by the Japanese television and radio broadcaster RCC Chugoku Broadcasting.

Our investigation began with the discovery of a cluster of suspicious domains—many generated using registered domain generation algorithms (RDGAs)—that were disproportionately queried by users in Japan. While we expected to uncover a classic investment scam, we discovered something quite different: a hybrid scam model that combines malvertising‑driven victim acquisition with messaging app‑centric pig butchering (Figure 1).

Figure 1. Hybrid use of malvertising and pig butchering

In these campaigns, ads impersonate well‑known financial experts or promote access to the “best” investment AI algorithm. These ads send users to websites that further redirect them to popular messaging apps. Once engaged, victims who have clicked on a legitimate messaging app link or scanned the official QR code, are drawn into one‑on‑one and group chats with AI bots that impersonate these experts, or often their assistants, and provide constant interaction, share fabricated success stories, and offer incentives such as gifts or rewards. Over time, they persuade victims to commit progressively larger amounts of money, culminating in a final demand for a so‑called “release fee” to unlock profits (which do not exist).

After pivoting on our initial DNS findings, we identified multiple interconnected campaigns and ultimately discovered more than 23,000 domains within this ecosystem. Although these campaigns may be operated by different actors, similarities in the underlying website framework along with overlapping advertising flows, analytic identifiers, and messaging‑based social engineering patterns suggest the presence and use of a shared enablement layer, potentially an as‑a‑service model or off‑the‑shelf kit.

To understand the campaigns more deeply, we engaged with the actors. We found that the chat groups had continuous engagement across time zones and a lack of disruption when conversations inadvertently changed language, strongly suggesting the use of automated or AI‑assisted chat systems, rather than a typical human‑driven interaction. In this blog, we’ll share our experience with the threat actors, as well as the DNS findings.

In addition to being a novel combination of malvertising and pig butchering, these campaigns may point toward how automation and AI‑assisted tooling could influence the future of social engineering to enable fraud. If this model were to be further developed, it could transform pig butchering from a high‑profit but labor-intensive operation into a faster, cheaper, and more globally scalable form of investment fraud.

From Malvertising to Messaging Apps

Cryptocurrency investment scams have long followed two familiar playbooks. In one, threat actors rely on malvertising, using social media ads, spam, or sponsored search results to push victims toward fake trading platforms designed to extract funds with the promise of high returns. In the other, pig butchering scams unfold more slowly, using prolonged and highly personalized social engineering techniques, typically via text messages and messaging apps, to encourage victims to invest progressively larger sums over time.

Both approaches are well documented, widely reported, and certainly familiar to us as a research team. We have previously studied each in depth, including our recent work on the booming pig butchering‑as‑a‑service (PBaaS) economy, as well as earlier research on many malvertising actors leveraging different DNS techniques for their campaigns, including Savvy Seahorse, who uses DNS CNAMEs and Facebook ads to lure victims to fake investment platforms. We’ve also documented other actors using Facebook ads and bulk domain registration, as well as lookalike domains used in AI-produced videos on hacked YouTube channels.

Over the past several months, however, we began to observe campaigns that no longer fit neatly into either category. What started as a DNS‑led investigation into suspicious domains disproportionately queried by users in Japan revealed a growing number of investment scams that effectively blend both approaches to scamming into a single operation.

Rather than using malvertising solely to direct victims to fraudulent investment platforms, these campaigns use it as an initial acquisition channel, redirecting users to “lure websites” where they are prompted to initiate contact through popular messaging applications, either by clicking on a legitimate messaging app link or scanning an official QR code. It is within these messaging apps that the social engagement phase, and ultimately the fraud itself, takes place.

This shift changes both the scale and the mechanics of these scams. Malvertising continues to provide reach and volume, while messaging apps offer a familiar and often trusted environment for sustained interactions. Together, they form a hybrid scam model that combines the efficiency and scale of malvertising with the psychological leverage of pig butchering.

These campaigns also use modified pig butchering techniques in an effort to better gain victims’ trust. Instead of scammers initiating contact, as is typical with these schemes, the workflow is structured so victims initiate each step of the scam themselves: clicking the ad, engaging with the lure website, and transitioning to the messaging application. This helps create an impression of voluntary participation rather than overt coercion.

Pivoting from the initial cluster of suspicious domains that triggered this investigation, we expanded our DNS analysis and identified thousands of additional domains associated with similar activity. A significant proportion of those appeared to have been generated using RDGAs, which are typically registered in bulk via APIs.

Threat actors use RDGAs to rapidly create and register large numbers of domains, reducing the time and effort required to scale their campaign infrastructure and allowing domains to be rotated in response to detection or takedown efforts.

While many of these RDGA domains consist of random character strings, others appear to have been created using brand‑related dictionaries to produce lookalike domain names. This is likely an attempt to make campaign-related domains such as googlenames[.]top and youtubefind[.]com appear familiar and legitimate, and therefore safe. When paired with social media advertising, these lookalike domains lower initial suspicion and increase the likelihood of victim engagement.

In addition to distinctive RDGA naming patterns, we used domain registration and DNS characteristics such as name server (NS) records, registrar selection, advertiser tracking IDs, and the autonomous system numbers (ASNs) associated with host IP addresses to identify more than 100 distinct clusters of domains associated with the same scam activity.

To illustrate the scale and complexity of these relationships, Figure 2 shows larger infrastructure nodes (combinations of registrars and name servers), along with the unique, smaller domain nodes associated with them.

Figure 2. Campaign-associated clusters comprised of infrastructure and domain nodes

The observed domain naming strategies correlate with domain longevity. Lookalike and dictionary-based domains often remain active for at least a year, whereas domains composed of random character strings are typically cycled out after approximately four months.

This pattern suggests a deliberate trade-off between domain credibility and disposability within the same operational model: higher-quality domain names seem to be reserved for longer-lived infrastructure while lower-effort domains appear to be treated as more disposable.

Although many of the identified domain clusters exhibit similar characteristics and are interrelated, there are clear differences in registrar usage, hosting providers and top-level domains (TLDs); see Table 1. This variation suggests distinct infrastructure choices, likely made by multiple operators, within a broader shared ecosystem.

The substantial volume of observed domains, the high frequency of new domain registrations and the diversity of supporting infrastructure are consistent with an industrial-scale deployment by multiple actors rather than a single small or localized campaign.

To date, we have associated more than 23,000 domains with this scam ecosystem, including instances where hundreds of domains were registered on a single day. Figure 3 illustrates a steady increase in registrations beginning in early 2025, punctuated by periodic spikes that align with intensified campaign activity in July and September.

Figure 3. Monthly distribution of second-level domain (SLD) registrations linked to these campaigns since January 2025

Upon investigation of the initial malvertising campaigns, we noted that the websites that were hosted on the domains we identified shared consistent layouts, messaging, and interaction flows. Across the large number of sites we analyzed, the underlying structure remained effectively unchanged, suggesting that they were generated from a common site framework or kit rather than being independently developed (Figure 4).

Figure 4. Structurally similar sites (Top: Financial expert variant; Bottom: AI algorithm variant)

These lure websites continue the narrative introduced by the initial malvertising messages to build credibility and trust by exploiting the likeness of the financial expert or offering access to the “best” investment AI algorithm.

The content of these sites is deliberately designed to prompt victim interaction through enticing language, eye‑catching visuals depicting potential investment results, and promises of free assistance, all leading to a clear call to action.

In some cases, visitors are directed to join an investment chat or community within a legitimate messaging app via a link or by scanning an official QR code (to facilitate access from mobile devices). In other cases, users are prompted to submit a company ticker symbol for “AI‑driven” analysis, reinforcing the illusion of legitimacy and credibility before being directed to the investment chats and communities.

Regardless of the interaction mechanism used, the role of these sites is to transition curious potential victims from the initial ad and into a familiar messaging app so that the “personal” interaction phase of the scam can begin.

We were able to use the domains identified during our DNS analysis to compile a catalog of structurally similar scam websites across multiple campaigns and regions.

Evidence of the repeated use of the same underlying framework, especially across otherwise distinct domain clusters, further supports the likelihood of there being a shared enablement layer that underpins most, if not all, of this activity.

Regional Targeting and Persona Impersonation

While Japanese journalists have reported on individual scams and the tens of thousands of yen lost by the victims, these incidents have largely been treated as isolated cases. However, we have been able to piece together a much broader picture by clustering the identified domains and correlating shared characteristics across campaigns.

Geographically, Japan has been the primary target and Asia has been the most heavily impacted region. That being said, the underlying threat appears to be increasingly global in scope. We detect an average of 4,000 RDGA‑generated domains per month tied to these campaigns, and they are active worldwide.

The lures in these Japanese campaigns follow the same patterns described in our April 2025 blog, which detailed common investment scam tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). Specifically, these campaigns use social media ads on platforms such as Instagram and Facebook, promising high returns and free investment advice while exploiting the likenesses of well‑known financial experts, including:

Hiroto Kiritani, a Japanese millionaire widely known as the “God of Freebies”

Nam Seok‑kwan, a prominent figure in the Korean investment industry

Chang Kuo‑wei, president of StarLux Airlines

Several of these individuals have publicly addressed the malicious campaigns abusing their likenesses, warning audiences about the associated risks and decrying the harm being caused to their reputations.

Further highlighting similarities across campaigns, a recent social media ad observed on Meta targeting Japanese speakers and misusing the likeness of Hiroto Kiritani (Figure 5) reuses youtubefind[.]top, a lure domain that was also used in an older campaign that targeted Spanish speakers (Figure 6).

Figure 6. Older ad on Meta targeting Spanish speakers, also directing to ‘youtubefind[.]top’ (Left: Original; Right: English translation)

While some of these ads were active for only a few hours, many remained online for considerably longer. Notably, even malicious ads that we directly reported to Meta as abusive remained online for approximately one week before any apparent enforcement action was taken.

These ads ultimately direct victims to actor‑controlled websites that form the next stage of the funnel. As shown in Figures 7 and 8, these sites are structurally similar and continue using the same persona as the ads to maintain the investment narrative before driving victims toward legitimate messaging apps such as KakaoTalk, LINE, and WhatsApp.

Figure 8. Destination website of a South Korean ad campaign (Left: Original; Right: English translation)

Chat Apps and AI Bots

Having encountered an active and ongoing campaign, we made the decision to engage directly, acting as scam bait, to observe and better understand how the fraud unfolds once victims are transitioned into messaging applications. From our resulting “victim experiences,” we confirmed that the TTPs were highly consistent across the campaigns we interacted with.

After clicking through the initial ad and following the flow from the lure website, we were directed into messaging applications, where it quickly became apparent that we were interacting with a chatbot rather than a human, and likely an AI‑driven one at that.

Following an initial one‑on‑one engagement with the impersonated “expert,” we were directed to a secondary chat with their “assistant.” From there, we were guided toward a larger “class group chat,” where a supposed teacher provided investment guidance and other “students, just like us” participated in ongoing daily discussions.

Figure 9 shows a snapshot of the many concurrent chats we became part of after engaging with only three campaigns.

Figure 9. Our “LINE” messaging app showing multiple scam chats and groups across three campaigns (Left: Original; Right: English translation)

Within these group chats, we received a steady stream of enticing messages, including promises of sky‑high profits from the “experts” and fabricated success stories shared by other “students.”

We were also offered a points-based incentive. The points would supposedly be redeemable for prizes (Figure 10) and awarded based on our continued engagement.

Figure 10. Pamphlet of incentive prizes shared during a chat session; we have our eyes on that massage chair! (Left: Original; Right: English translation)

We were encouraged to provide our thoughts on market‑related questions, such as “Do you think X stock will rise tonight?” or “Which currency should be exchanged for the yen: the euro or the dollar?” and share screenshots of our trading activity.

All these chats ultimately give the game away. Seemingly scripted chatter, recycled questions, and lightning‑fast responses at any hour all point toward automated, likely AI‑assisted behavior. While we cannot confirm that the same AI or chatbot system powers every campaign we observed, the consistency of interactions and account behaviors across campaigns strongly suggests the use of the same underlying ecosystem.

The apparent use of intelligent automated interactions demonstrates that pig butchering scams no longer require teams of human operators to maintain one‑on‑one conversations. Victims are effectively alone: there are no experts, no students, and no one gets to sit in that massage chair—except maybe the scammers.

We didn’t take the final step of the scam ourselves; instead, we relied on Japanese media reporting based on victim testimony to complete the sequence. According to these sources1,2 (one is geo-restricted to Japan), victims are first encouraged to deposit funds and make investments using legitimate applications and publicly traded stocks. Once a level of trust has been established, they are prompted to transfer money directly to the scammers, often under the pretext of earning extra profits.

Victims are then shown fabricated and exaggerated returns to give the illusion of success and encourage them to make further deposits. In reality, no investment activity takes place; the funds only enrich those behind the schemes. When the scammers decide to end the interaction, they inform victims that the service is shutting down and instruct them to pay a final fee to “release” their profits—the coup de grâce. By the time the deception becomes clear, the funds are long gone.

From Regional Threat to Global Model

While Japan and South Korea are among the most heavily impacted regions, campaigns associated with this ecosystem are increasingly targeting English-, German-, and Spanish‑speaking audiences. This shift suggests continued geographic expansion beyond the initial focus on Asia, likely enabled by infrastructure and workflows that are easily reused and localizable.

These campaigns demonstrate how pig butchering no longer needs to rely on labor-intensive, long‑con personal interactions. By combining malvertising‑driven victim acquisition with messaging‑centric pig butchering techniques, actors can now deploy scalable, automated business models that merge two previously distinct scam methods into a single operational workflow. The low cost of entry and ability to scale globally make this hybrid approach particularly attractive to cybercriminals and could point toward a meaningful shift in how investment fraud is conducted.

Overview & Challenges

The ServiceNow Configuration Management Database (CMDB) plays a critical role across IT operations. It informs incident response, drives change management, supports security investigations and underpins compliance reporting. However, in most enterprise environments today, the CMDB struggles to keep pace with the reality of modern infrastructure.

Assets are often discovered through disjointed tools and partial integrations, resulting in incomplete coverage across infrastructure and services. Ownership and governance information are frequently missing or outdated, making it difficult to determine who is responsible for what. Dependency visibility is limited or entirely absent, leaving teams blind to how assets relate to one another when incidents or changes occur.At the same time, many organizations lack meaningful CMDB metrics. Without a clear way to measure accuracy or completeness, CMDB health becomes subjective rather than data driven. Even when ServiceNow is tightly integrated into IT service management (ITSM) workflows, the underlying CMDB often remains only partially aligned, weakening the value of incident, change and problem management processes that depend on it.

As these gaps accumulate, the CMDB gradually drifts away from reality. Teams lose confidence in the data, automation becomes unreliable and the CMDB shifts from being a system of record to a system of assumption.

What It Teams Are Looking For

To restore trust in the CMDB, IT teams are looking for a fundamentally different approach: one that removes operational burden while increasing confidence in the data.

They want unified discovery across multiple sources that reflects what is actually present in the environment, without requiring teams to deploy and maintain additional tooling. They need clear asset dependency visibility so decisions can be made faster and with less risk during incidents and changes. Most importantly, they want the CMDB to function as a true, authoritative system of record grounded in evidence rather than manual upkeep.

Infoblox addresses these needs by correlating ServiceNow CMDB data with authoritative, network-based discovery, giving IT teams visibility they can trust without adding complexity. The result is a CMDB that works for IT, rather than one IT must constantly work to maintain.

Infoblox Approach To CMDB Reconciliation

Infoblox addresses this challenge by bringing measurable, evidence-based reconciliation to ServiceNow CMDB data with Infoblox Universal Asset Insights™. By analyzing CMDB records against Infoblox’s authoritative asset inventory built from continuous, network-based discovery, organizations gain a clear, objective understanding of how accurately their CMDB reflects what is actually running on the network.

Rather than treating CMDB accuracy as a best-effort or periodic cleanup activity, Infoblox transforms it into a quantifiable outcome. Assets observed on the network are compared directly with ServiceNow records, exposing where the two align and where they diverge. This removes ambiguity and replaces assumptions with verifiable insight.

Configuring the ServiceNow Provider

ServiceNow CMDB reconciliation starts by configuring ServiceNow as a provider in Infoblox using secure, scoped credentials. The integration is one-directional, syncing CMDB data from ServiceNow into Infoblox for analysis, with no data written back to ServiceNow.

Once configured, Infoblox retrieves selected CMDB classes and maps them to its asset inventory. Reconciliation runs automatically, providing continuous visibility into CMDB accuracy.

A step-by-step walkthrough is available in the deployment guide.

ServiceNow discovery configuration can be reviewed in ServiceNow under Configuration > Networking > Discovery > Integration.

Figure 1. Discovery job configurations

Refer to the deployment guide for detailed, step-by-step instructions on configuring the discovery job.

ServiceNow CMDB Permissions for Reconciliation

Infoblox requires read-only access to ServiceNow CMDB data to perform reconciliation. The integration is non-intrusive and does not write data back to ServiceNow.

A dedicated ServiceNow service account with the cmdb_read role is typically sufficient, providing read access to the cmdb_ci table and its derived classes. Administrators should also ensure that any custom ACLs do not restrict access to required CI records.

This least-privilege approach enables full CMDB visibility while maintaining strong security and governance controls.

ServiceNow CMDB Classes Included in Reconciliation

Infoblox synchronizes data from key ServiceNow CMDB tables to ensure accurate reconciliation against network-observed assets. The integration pulls from the core cmdb_ci table and selected subclasses that represent commonly deployed infrastructure, network and service components.

Compute assets are sourced from cmdb_ci_computer and its derived classes, including physical and virtual servers such as Windows, Linux and ESX systems, as well as cmdb_ci_vm_instance and other workstation or endpoint classes.

Network infrastructure is synchronized from the cmdb_ci_netgear hierarchy, covering routers, firewalls, switches and wireless access points. To support interface-level correlation, data is also ingested from cmdb_ci_network_adapter.

Service and platform components are included through classes such as cmdb_ci_database and cmdb_ci_lb_service, while additional operational assets are sourced from cmdb_ci_printer and cmdb_ci_security.

This focused set of CMDB classes ensures reconciliation reflects the assets and services that most directly impact network visibility, operations and security.

Asset Categorization and Visibility Gaps

As part of the reconciliation process, assets are automatically categorized based on their presence in ServiceNow and their visibility on the network. Assets that appear in both systems confirm where the CMDB is accurate and reliable. Assets that exist in ServiceNow but are no longer observed on the network often indicate stale or decommissioned records that were never removed. Equally important are assets that are active on the network but missing from ServiceNow altogether, revealing blind spots that can affect security posture, incident response and audit readiness.

This categorization helps teams quickly understand not just that discrepancies exist, but also the nature and impact of each discrepancy.

Understanding the CMDB Reconciliation Monitor

At the heart of this capability is the CMDB reconciliation monitor, which provides an at-a-glance view of CMDB accuracy. Instead of requiring teams to sift through thousands of configuration items, the monitor summarizes how closely ServiceNow aligns with what Infoblox observes on the network.

The monitor highlights the proportion of assets that are consistent across both systems, those that appear only in ServiceNow and those that are active on the network but missing from the CMDB. This high-level visibility makes CMDB health immediately apparent and allows teams to identify whether accuracy is improving or degrading over time.

Because the monitor is continuously updated, it also acts as an early warning system. Sudden shifts in accuracy can signal untracked infrastructure changes, discovery failures or gaps in operational workflows.

The monitor can be found on Asset Workspace under Network:

Figure 2. Asset Workspace

How to Read and Act on Monitor Data

Figure 3. Asset Reconciliation monitor

Interpreting the monitor data is straightforward and actionable. A high percentage of assets present in both ServiceNow and Infoblox indicates strong CMDB hygiene and reliable downstream automation. Assets listed in ServiceNow but not observed on the network typically point to stale records that should be reviewed for retirement or cleanup. Assets that are active on the network but missing from ServiceNow often require immediate attention, as they represent visibility gaps with potential security, compliance and operational implications.

From the monitor, teams can drill into detailed reconciliation reports that identify the exact assets contributing to each category. These reports provide the evidence required to take confident action whether that means updating CMDB entries, investigating unauthorized infrastructure or validating discovery coverage. Reports can be exported or scheduled, ensuring continuous oversight of CMDB quality.

Figure 4. Options for generating reports

From Periodic Cleanup to Continuous CMDB Accuracy

CMDB accuracy is not achieved through one-time reconciliation efforts. Environments evolve constantly, and asset data must evolve with them. By continuously measuring ServiceNow CMDB data against Infoblox’s authoritative discovery, organizations shift from reactive cleanup to proactive data governance.

The result is a CMDB that teams can trust. Incidents are resolved faster, change decisions are made with greater confidence and security teams gain clearer visibility into what truly exists in the environment. With Infoblox, ServiceNow CMDB reconciliation becomes a living process, one that keeps pace with modern, dynamic infrastructure and restores the CMDB to its role as a dependable source of truth.

[125] Infoblox Blog - Closing the CMDB Trust Gap Starts with the Network

For years, CIOs and infrastructure leaders have invested heavily in configuration management database (CMDB) initiatives with a clear goal: creating a trusted foundation for IT operations, security and business decision-making. Yet, despite those investments, most CMDB programs struggle to deliver lasting value. According to Gartner, 75 percent of CMDB initiatives fail to meet expectations due to poor data quality and completeness.

I spend a lot of time talking with customers, and this topic comes up in almost every conversation. At a recent customer event, I asked the room to raise their hand if they had a CMDB. Nearly every hand went up. Then I asked them to keep their hand raised if they were happy with the accuracy and quality of their CMDB data. Not a single hand stayed up.

The problem is rarely a lack of effort or a limitation of the CMDB platform itself. Instead, it comes down to a more fundamental problem: CMDB data often cannot keep pace with the reality of modern infrastructure.

The Hidden Cost of Inaccurate CMDB Data

Modern IT environments are dynamic by nature. Assets are created, moved and retired constantly across data centers, campuses, clouds and remote locations. Yet many CMDBs still rely on fragmented discovery sources and periodic scans that capture only snapshots in time.
When CMDB data drifts from reality, the impact shows up quickly. Infrastructure teams may spend 16 or more hours per month manually reconciling discrepancies between CMDB records, discovery tools and spreadsheets. Dependency data becomes less reliable for change and release decisions. Security teams contend with blind spots caused by unknown or unmanaged assets, an especially serious concern given that the vast majority of security incidents involve assets that were never properly tracked.

At a recent CIO dinner I attended, this topic came up during the discussion and generated strong interest. Several CIOs described CMDB accuracy as a top organizational priority and shared that they were allocating significant budget this year to CMDB cleanup initiatives. The encouraging part was that there was broad agreement on the problem and a willingness to invest in fixing it. What was less clear to these CIOs was how to address it in a durable way. Manual cleanup projects and periodic remediation efforts can improve data in the short term, but they do not change the underlying issue: CMDB data still struggles to stay aligned with the pace of modern infrastructure.

When accuracy is treated as a one-time project rather than something that is continuously measured, the same gaps inevitably return.

Why the Network Is the Missing Foundation

What many organizations overlook is that they already have one of the most reliable sources of asset visibility available. Anything that is operational eventually connects to the network. Through critical network services such as DNS and DHCP, the Infoblox DDI platform provides continuous, authoritative visibility into IP-connected assets across environments and locations.
The challenge is not collecting more data. It is using the intelligence that already exists. When CMDB data is continuously compared against live network activity, accuracy becomes observable instead of assumed. Rather than relying on periodic discovery cycles or manual audits, teams gain an objective view of what is actually present and active in their environment.

This is the visibility advantage of authoritative DDI data, and it is the foundation many CMDB initiatives have been missing.

Expanding Infoblox Universal Asset Insights™ to Address CMDB Accuracy

Today, we are launching new capabilities in Infoblox Universal Asset Insights™ to help customers directly address long-standing CMDB accuracy challenges by grounding asset data in authoritative network visibility.

With this release, Universal Asset Insights automatically correlates ServiceNow CMDB data with network-observed asset inventory to continuously measure alignment between what is documented and what is actually seen. Assets naturally fall into clear categories:

Assets present in both systems

Assets listed in the ServiceNow CMDB but no longer observed

Assets active on the network but missing from the ServiceNow CMDB

This shifts CMDB accuracy from a periodic cleanup exercise to an ongoing, measurable process. By making gaps visible, teams gain the clarity needed to take informed, data-driven action without adding operational complexity.

How Trusted CMDB Data Improves Every Team

When CMDB data is accurate, the benefits extend well beyond asset management. IT operations teams resolve incidents faster when assets and services are accurately represented. Change and release teams reduce risk by understanding real dependencies and potential blast radius. Security teams gain earlier visibility into unmanaged assets that introduce exposure. Cloud, DevOps and infrastructure teams plan more effectively with confidence in what actually exists. Executives receive reporting they can trust when assessing risk, resilience and investment priorities. An authoritative network source does not just improve CMDB data quality. It restores confidence in the foundation teams rely on every day.

This foundation is becoming even more important as organizations adopt AIOps and agentic workflows. These systems increasingly rely on CMDB data to drive automation, root-cause analysis and decision-making. When asset and dependency data is incomplete or out of date, automation amplifies the problem rather than solving it.

Customers exploring AI-driven operations are realizing that the effectiveness of these initiatives depends directly on the quality of the data they are built on. A CMDB that reflects what is actually present and active is no longer just an operational nice-to-have. It becomes a prerequisite for safely scaling automation.

Start Turning DDI-Powered Visibility into CMDB Confidence

A trusted CMDB is built over time. It depends on continuously measuring accuracy, maintaining confidence in the data and ensuring teams can rely on it as environments evolve. Universal Asset Insights helps organizations close the CMDB trust gap by grounding accuracy in the one place that already sees everything: the network.

If CMDB accuracy is something you are actively working through, the best way to evaluate this approach is to see it against your own environment. You can start with a free trial of Universal Asset Insights and directly measure how your CMDB aligns with what is actually present and active on the network.

[126] Infoblox Blog - Novel AI Techniques for DNS Tunnel Security
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Thu, 05 Feb 2026 15:55:44 +0000

[TAM METİN - 2457 kelime]
DNS tunneling is a critical security threat where malicious actors exploit the Domain Name System (DNS) to exfiltrate data and bypass network security controls by embedding unauthorized communications within legitimate DNS queries. This blog presents Infoblox’s machine learning-based detection system that achieves 99.9 percent precision, 99.5 percent recall and a 99.7 percent F1 score in identifying DNS tunneling attacks, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the highest performing DNS tunneling detection system.

Our patented approach combines a convolutional neural network (CNN) autoencoder that generates a reconstruction loss feature with novel statistical and linguistic features extracted from DNS traffic patterns. The autoencoder learns normal DNS query behavior from millions of legitimate domains, producing reconstruction loss values that effectively distinguish between normal and anomalous activity. Our feature engineering captures many characteristics such as query frequency patterns, subdomain entropy, word segmentation ratios and payload size distributions. These features are then processed by a Random Forest classifier for final detection. This system operates in real time on billions of DNS queries daily with low false positive rates, enabling us to automatically block DNS tunneling attempts while preserving legitimate network traffic. Portions of this work were previously presented at CAMLIS and Flocon.

The DNS translates domains (www.google.com) to resource records that contain critical information such as IP addresses (8.8.8.8). Generally, a client requests a local recursive DNS server to look up the address on its behalf. See  Figure 1 for a visual explanation.

Figure 1. The typical process of how DNS operates

DNS tunneling abuses this legitimate process by creating a covert communication channel that transmits unauthorized data through DNS queries and responses—far beyond DNS’s intended purpose as defined in the RFC specifications. Since DNS traffic is typically allowed through firewalls and often goes unmonitored, attackers exploit this trusted protocol to bypass security controls and establish command-and-control (C2) channels.

Recent threat campaigns have demonstrated the growing sophistication of DNS tunneling attacks, including operations like Decoy Dog, Saitama and DNS Anchor. These real-world examples underscore why DNS tunneling detection and mitigation has become a critical priority for cybersecurity teams.

For a comprehensive explanation of DNS tunneling and a survey of tools we have seen in traffic, see our blog.

Table 1 shows the stark difference between legitimate DNS traffic and DNS tunneling traffic, illustrating how attackers encode data within domain names to create covert communication channels.

This blog presents our machine learning approach to DNS tunnel detection, which introduces two novel feature extraction techniques: CNN autoencoder-derived reconstruction loss and word segmentation analysis. By combining these innovations with traditional DNS traffic features, we achieve state-of-the-art detection performance while maintaining the low false positive rates essential for operational deployment.

We use the logs collected from DNS queries and responses observed below the resolver. This data includes the timestamp, source IP, Query Name (Qname), Query Type (Qtype), Response Code (RCode) and Resource Records. Table 1 shows a small sample set of this data. Table 2 contains a description of the fields we used.

To obtain benign domain data for our classifier, we used DNS logs containing queries from a variety of businesses, internet service providers, schools and other networks. We selected separate one-hour windows over the course of four days. As DNS tunneling is a very rare event, we assume that we will not have any DNS tunneling being performed and the collection represents only benign domains. We also perform two important filtering tasks:

We filter out the top 500 most queried effective second level domains (SLDs), as these account for over 50 percent of all DNS traffic on a typical network. These domains represent trivial classification cases that provide minimal learning value—any reasonable detector would correctly classify them as benign. By excluding these obvious cases, we focus our training on the more challenging boundary cases where the model needs to develop sophisticated discriminative features to distinguish between subtle benign patterns and tunneling traffic.

We removed from the data set the SLDs from a list of known benign DNS tunnels. These include antivirus tools, spam filters and similar tools. In operational deployment, our secondary validation processes are specifically designed to handle and allowlist such legitimate tunneling applications, ensuring they do not trigger false positive alerts.

We also augment our benign dataset with challenging edge cases and adversarial examples that resemble tunneling patterns but are legitimate, ensuring the classifier maintains low false positive rates.

We incorporate hundreds of thousands of DNS tunneling queries representing a comprehensive spectrum of tunneling techniques and evasion strategies. Our malicious dataset encompasses traffic from widely used open-source frameworks including Pupy, DNSCat2, Sliver, Iodine and Cobalt Strike, as well as bespoke custom implementations developed by penetration testers and security researchers. This diverse collection was assembled through multiple acquisition methodologies: deployment of previous detection algorithms in production environments, retrospective analysis of historical network data and controlled sandbox execution of tunneling tools across various operational scenarios. This multi-faceted approach ensures our dataset captures the full range of tunneling behaviors observed in real-world attack scenarios, from common tool signatures to sophisticated custom implementations designed to evade detection.

The final training dataset is balanced between tunneling and benign samples at the query level, following standard data science practices to ensure effective classifier training and unbiased performance evaluation. However, the dataset remains imbalanced at the SLD level, reflecting real-world conditions where blocking decisions are made at the SLD level.

Building upon our dataset preparation and classification approach, we now detail the feature engineering methodology that forms the core of our detection system. The features are extracted at fixed time intervals, grouped by SLD and client IP address in a sliding window. Our feature set combines established metrics from existing literature with two novel contributions that, to the author’s knowledge, have not been previously applied to DNS tunnel detection.

Throughout this post we use “prefix” as terminology for the string portion of a domain name with the SLD removed. In the fictitious example, “abcd123efg.example.com”, “example.com” represents the SLD while “abcd123efg” constitutes the prefix. We focus particularly on prefix analysis since this is where tunneling applications typically encode information for client-to-server communication. Table 3 describes some of the features from our complete set of 20 features, followed by detailed discussion of our two novel techniques for deriving features: autoencoder reconstruction loss extraction and word segmentation analysis.

Autoencoder-Based Feature Extraction

We explore the use of a shallow one-dimensional CNN autoencoder technique to derive reconstruction loss features for our classification model. The autoencoder processes DNS prefixes by first converting each character into numerical embeddings, creating a vector representation of the domain string. For example, the domain prefix “Infoblox” would be transformed into a sequence of character vectors: [“i”, “n”, “f”, “o”, “b”, “l”, “o”, “x”]. The encoder then compresses this sequence into a lower-dimensional latent representation, capturing the essential patterns of the input string. The decoder subsequently attempts to reconstruct the original character sequence from this compressed representation.

We train the autoencoder on a set of 4 million prefixes from non-tunneling domains. The unsupervised model learns to encode strings into a vector space and then reconstruct them, minimizing the reconstruction loss during training. Through this process, the autoencoder learns the typical patterns and structures found in legitimate domain prefixes, such as natural language words, common abbreviations and recognizable naming conventions.

During evaluation, “normal” traffic exhibits low reconstruction loss while tunneling and other “abnormal” traffic produces high reconstruction loss, providing a discriminative feature for classification. Since tunneling prefixes often contain encoded, encrypted or randomly generated data (like “2po3asvtjvfkebjuke4qsvf3ja6agsznrt”), the autoencoder struggles to reconstruct these unfamiliar patterns, resulting in higher loss values that serve as strong indicators of malicious activity.

Initial experiments used Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the loss function. While effective for comparing prefixes of equal length, it performed poorly when comparing prefixes of unequal length. In some cases, this resulted in non-tunneling prefixes having larger reconstruction loss than shorter tunneling domains. We therefore introduced a custom masked MSE (MMSE) loss function which calculates loss only over the non-zero values of the original example. Incorporating the MMSE loss function within our autoencoder architecture reduces sensitivity to varying domain prefix lengths, producing more reliable reconstruction loss features.

Our architecture employs a pair of convolutional layers for encoding and two deconvolutional layers for decoding, with a dropout layer for regularization. Figure 2 shows the kernel density estimates for the reconstruction loss feature across tunnel and non-tunnel domains.

Figure 2. KDE plot for CNN autoencoder reconstruction loss

Word Segmentation-Based Feature Extraction

The majority of legitimate prefixes use natural language words, whereas tunneling prefixes often employ hex, base32 or similar encodings that result in a larger number of word segments. We employ a cost-based word segmentation technique that segments strings into words found in language dictionaries to derive segmentation-based features. For example, the string “facebooksecurity” segments into [“face”, “book”, “security”], while an encoded string such as “youjf34gwid86fih” segments into [“you”, “j”, “f”, “34”, “g”, “w”, “id”, “86”, “f”, “i”, “h”] since no dictionary words match the encoded content.

Using this segmentation technique, we derive multiple features including the ratio of segment count to query name length. We observe that tunneling domains exhibit significantly higher segment-to-length ratios due to their encoded nature—random or encrypted data breaks down into many small, unrecognizable fragments rather than coherent dictionary words. This creates a highly discriminative feature where tunnel prefixes consistently produce much higher ratios compared to legitimate domains.

Table 4 demonstrates this discriminative power through concrete examples. The benign domain “facebooksecurity” achieves a low segment ratio of 0.19 (3 segments/16 characters), while the tunnel prefix “youjf34gwid86can” produces a much higher ratio of 0.69 (11 segments/16 characters). This substantial difference in segment ratios provides a reliable signal for distinguishing between legitimate domain patterns and encoded tunneling data.

Results—Classifier Performance

We evaluated our approach using multiple classification algorithms to establish comprehensive performance baselines. Table 5 presents the performance comparison between Random Forest and Logistic Regression classifiers across both query-level and domain-level metrics.

The Random Forest classifier demonstrates superior performance across all metrics, achieving an F1 score of 99.71 percent at the query level and 96.79 percent at the domain level. While Logistic Regression maintains competitive recall (98.13 percent query-level, 95.42 percent domain-level), it performs with significantly lower precision, particularly at the domain level (34.76 percent), resulting in a substantially lower domain-level F1 score of 50.96 percent.

The domain-level metrics are particularly important for operational deployment, as they reflect the classifier’s ability to correctly identify tunneling domains rather than individual queries. These metrics are calculated by aggregating results at the SLD level: domain-level recall measures the number of unique tunnel SLDs correctly identified divided by the total number of unique tunnel SLDs in the test set, while domain-level precision calculates the number of unique tunnel SLDs correctly identified divided by the total number of unique SLDs flagged as tunnels. This approach provides a more operationally relevant view than query-level metrics, as we typically need to block entire domains rather than individual queries. This is why we are particularly worried about precision, as blocking at the SLD level can add significant risk of blocking a domain that is potentially useful to our customers. The Random Forest’s strong domain-level precision (95 percent) indicates effective reduction of false positive alerts, which is crucial for practical cybersecurity applications. Equally important, the model achieves exceptional domain-level recall (99 percent), demonstrating its ability to detect nearly all tunneling domains with minimal false negatives. This high recall ensures that malicious DNS tunneling activities are rarely missed, providing comprehensive threat coverage.

The emphasis on maximizing recall is strategically designed for our multi-stage detection architecture. In our systems, the primary classifier serves as a comprehensive detection layer that captures potential threats with minimal risk of missing genuine attacks, while subsequent validation processes systematically filter out false positives through additional verification mechanisms and threat intelligence correlation. Additionally, our defense-in-depth approach ensures that any tunnels potentially missed by this classifier can still be detected by our complementary DNS tunnel detection systems, providing multiple layers of protection against evasive tunneling techniques. This approach prioritizes comprehensive threat detection over initial precision, recognizing that missing a genuine DNS tunnel poses significantly greater security risks than flagging legitimate traffic for further analysis. Through these secondary validation stages, the system ensures that false positives are reduced, allowing only likely malicious DNS tunnels to trigger final alerts and automated response actions.

The combination of strong recall and precision scores at the domain level indicate the Random Forest model is capable of performing operational DNS tunnel detection, where maintaining thorough threat coverage while minimizing analyst workload is essential for scalable cybersecurity operations.

Figure 5. Comparison of SLD-level model performance

Evaluation of Novel Features: Measuring Impact Through Feature Removal

To evaluate the contribution of our novel features—autoencoder reconstruction loss and word segmentation ratios—we conducted an ablation study by training the Random Forest classifier with and without these enhancements. This analysis quantifies the direct impact of our proposed features on model performance.

As shown in Figure 6, the removal of novel features results in substantial performance degradation across all metrics. Most notably, SLD-level precision drops significantly from 95 percent to 86 percent when novel features are excluded, while SLD-level recall decreases from 99 percent to 98 percent. The F1 score similarly declines from 97 percent to 92 percent, demonstrating the critical importance of these features for effective tunnel detection.

The precision improvement is particularly significant given our operational context, where the system processes DNS traffic at the scale of billions of events per day. Even a modest increase in precision translates to a substantial reduction in false positive alerts, potentially eliminating thousands of incorrect flags daily. This reduction directly impacts secondary validation tasks and system efficiency, making the novel features essential for practical deployment. Furthermore, the maintained high recall ensures that genuine threats are not missed despite the improved precision, validating the effectiveness of our feature engineering approach.

Figure 6. Impact of novel features on model performance

Real-Time Implementation

In our production platform, we create feature summaries and execute the model in near– real time to process billions of DNS queries daily. Our high-throughput data processing infrastructure enables us to detect potential tunneling activity within seconds of occurrence.

Following the primary detection, secondary validation processes are performed to enhance precision and reduce false positives. These include:

Allowlist Validation: Removing known benign tunneling applications such as antivirus software, security tools and legitimate update mechanisms

Infrastructure Analysis: Examining name servers, registrars and hosting providers associated with flagged SLDs

Behavioral Correlation: Cross-referencing with threat intelligence and historical patterns

The secondary validation layer operates as a scalable microservice architecture, providing resilient processing of flagged domains. After completing both primary detection and secondary validation, the system performs final actions including alerting, blocking or forwarding to security teams for investigation.

Enabling Preemptive Security for Google Cloud Workloads

Last year, Google Cloud announced the public preview of DNS Armor, a cloud-native protective DNS service in partnership with  Infoblox that delivers preemptive threat detection for internet-bound DNS queries initiated from Google Cloud workloads.

Since then, adoption of the service has been rapid. In just the preview phase, hundreds of customers adopted DNS Armor to defend their cloud workloads. During that period, Infoblox has observed the service process more than 22 billion DNS queries and surface over 8.5 million threats, delivering protection at internet scale.

Backed by this strong early customer adoption, DNS Armor is now generally available, and customers can activate it within the Google Cloud console to start protecting their applications and workloads without additional infrastructure or complexity. Whether you’re running workloads on Google Compute Engine, hosting apps on Google Cloud Storage, or deploying Google’s AI and machine learning models, any Google Cloud workload that has an IP and uses Google Cloud’s default DNS resolver to connect to the internet can benefit from the protection offered by DNS Armor.

Cloud Adoption and Why Workload Protection Matters Now More Than Ever

Cloud adoption continues to accelerate as enterprises embrace digital transformation, yet this shift has also placed sensitive applications, data and infrastructure squarely in the crosshairs of attackers. Threat actors target cloud workloads that hold PII, intellectual property, and application code. These threats are also becoming more frequent, sophisticated (ransomware attacks surged by 132% in Q1 ’25 aided by AI deception), and damaging (the global cost of cybercrime is expected to surge to $13.82T by 2028).

Traditional security detects threats after they impact a workload and are no longer sufficient in an era where adversaries use AI to constantly mutate their malicious campaigns. In addition, most tools don’t monitor DNS activities, which provides early warning signals when it comes to detecting potential malicious activity. Finally, managing disparate non-native security solutions to protect cloud workloads adds complexity.

For years, cybersecurity strategies have been built around a simple “patient zero” model. A new attack hits an organization (also known as “patient zero”), the rest of the industry learns how it works, and then updates are made to security tools to protect other organizations. This reactive model largely worked in a pre-AI world, where attackers reused malware, attack techniques and domains long enough for security clouds to learn, share indicators, and protect everyone else after the first victim.

That assumption is now broken.

AI has fundamentally changed the economics and execution of cyberattacks. Threat actors are using AI to automate reconnaissance, generate single-use malware, personalize attacks at scale, and continuously mutate campaigns. In this new reality, every organization is effectively “patient zero.” In fact, 95% of the 25 million domains classified as malicious by Infoblox in a single year were seen at only one enterprise, highlighting how single-use infrastructure has become the norm where domains are weaponized and then disappear.

To combat this shifting threat landscape, security must become preemptive, stopping AI-driven attacks, no matter how many times they evolve and mutate.

DNS Armor Delivers Preemptive Security

DNS Armor brings Infoblox-enabled predictive threat intelligence and analytics directly into Google Cloud, enabling enterprises to secure their cloud workloads with a scalable, easy-to-manage service.

DNS Armor analyzes DNS queries in real time and uses both threat intelligence feeds and algorithmic detection to identify malicious activity before it can impact workloads. This includes:

Blocking DNS queries to known malicious domains

Detecting newly registered domains likely to be weaponized

Identifying DNS tunneling used for data exfiltration

Spotting communication with malware C2 infrastructure

Recognizing lookalike domains used in phishing campaigns

By combining ongoing DNS telemetry with machine learning, Infoblox, on average, blocks attacks 68.4 days before other tools detect them with a 0.0002 percent false positive rate. DNS Armor provides this proven threat detection technology to Google customers.

You can learn about the DNS Armor service in depth by viewing the Infoblox-Google webinar or reading this white paper.

The general availability of DNS Armor signals that this advanced proactive detection service is ready for production, ready for enterprise use, and ready to help organizations secure their cloud environments with confidence.

[128] Infoblox Blog - Compromised Routers, DNS, and a TDS Hidden in Aeza Networks
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Tue, 03 Feb 2026 15:55:59 +0000

[TAM METİN - 1880 kelime]
When most people say DNS, they are thinking about the global DNS system, the official mechanism for resolving domain names on the internet. But shadow systems exist. Visiting a website relies on a DNS resolution chain that iteratively queries authoritative name servers within the distributed DNS hierarchy to get an IP address. This resolution all happens in the background, and users put a lot of trust into DNS resolvers without even realizing they exist. If the IP address of those resolvers is changed, a website’s domain name might resolve to an entirely different IP address, sending an unwitting visitor to an entirely different location.

We discovered compromised routers whose DNS settings had been changed to use shadow resolvers hosted in Aeza International (AS210644), a bulletproof hosting company (BPH) sanctioned by the U.S. Government in July 2025. The DNS change meant that every device behind that router was serviced not by the local ISP’s DNS resolvers, but by the threat actor. The Aeza resolvers selectively altered the responses, allowing them to direct users to a range of malicious content, all through a DNS resolution. This shadow network also incorporates an HTTP-based traffic distribution system (TDS), further allowing the actor to fingerprint users and funnel them to content of the actor’s choosing. The combination of an alternate DNS and TDS, along with a clever DNS trick to prevent probing by security groups, has allowed the actor to remain undetected for years. Figure 1 provides a high-level overview of how the system works.

Figure 1. An overview of the two-part TDS hosted in Aeza International

This system appears to be operated by a financially motivated actor in the affiliate marketing space. Since mid-2022, they have directed user traffic to adtech platforms through “smartlinks,” a mechanism used in affiliate advertising to fingerprint a device and redirect the user to “advertising” content. The links contain unregistered domains and require interaction with one of the shadow DNS servers to resolve. We use quotes here for advertising because often this content is malware or scams.

While the actor’s verified activity is affiliate marketing, they could have interfered in other ways with devices in the network. As a trusted source, they could alter DNS records for any domain and run adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) operations, not just for websites, but for the domain names of critical applications and services.

We cannot emphasize this enough: the DNS resolver is in a position of power.

The threat actor compromises routers, particularly older models, and changes the DNS settings on them. Every device using that router will unwittingly use the shadow DNS network.

One user described their experience in early 2025 in a Reddit post titled “HELP im going insane” [sic].  In a now-deleted response, another user describes their own experience, which hints that the exploitation goes beyond the router exploitation that we verified; see Figure 2. This threat is deceiving and will lead to the assumption that a problem exists in other services: online users complained that they could not access Google Sheets or that they were regularly redirected when using Google Chrome. These user reports indicate that the threat actor has manipulated DNS in some cases where we would expect the encrypted DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) to be used and the router-set DNS server to be ignored. It’s possible that in these cases, the user has turned off the secure DNS option or there is another underlying compromise on the device; we don’t know.

Figure 2. A Reddit response to a user post about being unable to use their home network without interference; this response and the original question are now deleted but were online in November 2025.

There are dozens of recursive resolvers in the shadow Aeza network. Each compromised router is assigned a pair of them for DNS resolution. Answers to queries contain a time-to-live (TTL) of 20 seconds, forcing the devices to regularly connect to the Aeza resolver and ensuring that malicious redirects are difficult to replicate.

The threat actor modifies responses based on the domain name requested, the router’s location, time between queries from the router, and randomization. Extremely popular domains such as Google or Facebook are, in our experience, usually answered truthfully. Others that are still popular or related to critical services may be modified. For example, we have seen altered responses for domains like shopify[.]com and okta[.]com. The resolvers will also answer queries for non-existent domains, which are often seen because of typos or as leaks from devices on a network for local domains.

Answers from the resolvers change based on several factors, and the correct IP address is frequently returned so that malicious redirects are limited and unpredictable. If any of the resolvers are queried “too often” in a short period of time, they will return 255.255.255.255 to the query. The reason for this response in lieu of the correct resolution is unclear to us.

The DNS portion of the TDS uses a surprising trick to hide from security testing: it only answers DNS queries with a specific format. For example, if you query one of the name servers, e.g., 89.208.105.113, for the IP address of shopify[.]com, under most conditions you will get an error:

;; Warning: Message parser reports malformed message packet.

This stumped us for months. We knew that the queries were resolving for some devices but couldn’t trigger a response ourselves. Persistent tinkering led to a solution! If we sent a query without the Extension Mechanisms for DNS (EDNS0) included, voila! The name server replied.

This restriction by the threat actor is surprising because EDNS0 was introduced over a decade ago and is part of a standard DNS implementation. As a protocol extension, EDNS0 can serve a variety of purposes, including increasing the accepted size of a response, supporting DNSSEC, and providing hints about the client device location. Because most DNS resolvers enable EDNS0, queries to the Aeza hosts will usually result in a malformed response.

Here is how to trigger a response from the command line:

dig +noedns @89.208.105.113 shopify.com

After building signatures, we found over three dozen resolvers for the system in early November 2025.  Some of those IP addresses include: 104[.]238[.]29[.]136, 138[.]124[.]101[.]153, 193[.]233[.]232[.]229, 45[.]80[.]228[.]233, 89[.]208[.]103[.]145.

Thus far, we have only triggered a response by disabling EDNS0, but we suspect there is more to be learned. The number of routers that don’t use EDNS0 is dwindling and would seem to limit their operation. Additionally, from one of our research partners, we know that the threat actor is broadly and regularly searching for new routers to attack. So, why keep this restriction? But….

Getting the DNS resolvers to respond is only the first piece of this puzzle….

When a user’s browser connects to the altered IP address, e.g., 147.45.69.3, the device is fingerprinted and then directed to the next stage of the TDS if it passes the initial checks. This IP address serves as a proxy for the HTTP TDS, see Figure 3 for the host posture. Upon connection, a JavaScript file is returned that includes additional DNS queries which ensure that the connecting device is behind a compromised router. This is accomplished by including a URL with a domain name that should not resolve, e.g., gettranslate[.]ir. If the domain does not resolve, the script will redirect the user to www[.]google[.]com.

Figure 3. Host posture of TDS proxy (147.45.69.3) returned by the shadow DNS servers as of January 21, 2026

The script we analyzed contained seemingly old code, including URLs hosted on domains that were apparently never registered. See Figure 4. The purposes of the various functions re(), red(), redbo(), etc., are unknown. If the device is unable to resolve gettranslate[.]ir and connect on port 18443, it will do a refresh and load Google’s primary landing page. We have uncovered other versions of the scripts which use a different .ir domain.

Figure 4. Malicious script received in November 2025 through the Aeza TDS showing historical code using links on unregistered domains; the current function redbool() will attempt to connect to gettranslate[.]ir on port 18443.

If the first connection is successful, the device will be redirected again to another affiliate marketing platform link. From the URL

http://gettranslate[.]ir:18443/baner?sig=ded8deb7ff580788cc58cbbf5508f3bf&BanerId=347333

we were redirected to an adtech TDS that we track via

www.effectivegatecpm[.]com/bag4ni13i?key=cef13d2e5a9d1e200a50a6b3834cc7a9

From there, our traffic was resold and eventually we were shown various advertisements. But with all these checks in place to ensure the traffic is coming from the compromised routers, our browser would frequently end up at the requested site or redirected to Google.

We have found instances where directly visiting the TDS IP address resulted in an immediate redirection to a smartlink. For example, in the past, connecting to 89.208.107.49:8081 redirected to a smartlink using jackpotshop[.]life hosted in AS6898.

For reasons that are unclear, portions of the script were injected into comments in online forums, as well.

In our research, the TDS always forced the browser into one of the two adtech platforms. But it is possible the threat actor is doing more with this system; the Reddit thread we uncovered indicated that bitcoin miners were installed and the admin was locked out.

While not overly sophisticated, the design of this TDS is clever and has a reasonable amount of infrastructure to maintain just to deliver unwanted advertising. And it’s clearly worked—this actor has operated undetected for years.

The Aeza shadow TDS we discovered harkens back to the days of DNSChanger malware, which was the work of an Estonian company. Distributed as software necessary to view videos on websites, the malware changed DNS configurations and served advertising content from the company. The FBI seized the C2 servers and indicted key figures in 2011.

Controlling DNS resolution is extremely powerful and goes well beyond the ability to deliver ads to a user. For example, a threat actor can selectively answer queries for critical services that are not protected by SSL certificates, or they can deny access to resources. The DNSChanger malware prevented antivirus updates on infected machines as a means of persistence.

More recently, ESET Research published findings on a Chinese actor who had tampered with DNS resolver settings and targeted software updates. The ability to determine when software is updated and to deliver modified updates can allow lateral movement within a network. Beyond these examples, DNS is used to discover services, check systems, establish trust, and connect to resources for every aspect of internet communication.

Overlay networks like this one can also impact DNS research because the false records get absorbed into some databases. There are many commercial sources for passive DNS available and some of these rely on “port 53” collection. In these cases, responses from authoritative name servers within the global DNS are mixed with the responses from alternate resolvers like the ones we’ve described here. If researchers aren’t aware of the type of DNS data they are using, they can draw false conclusions.

In our case, a third-party “port 53” collection helped us recognize this overlay network. There were Kimwolf botnet domains in that database, which resolved incorrectly to 89[.]208[.]107[.]49, an IP address we had already been monitoring for a few years. Independently, we had been “noodling” over mysterious DNS resolutions for domains like gettranslate[.]ir. Suddenly, we were able to put these two puzzles together and once we had the EDNS0 trick, the mystery quickly unraveled. How fun is that?
