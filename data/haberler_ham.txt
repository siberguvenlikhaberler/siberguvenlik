[TAM METİN - 3258 kelime]
This week’s recap shows how small gaps are turning into big entry points. Not always through new exploits, often through tools, add-ons, cloud setups, or workflows that people already trust and rarely question.

Another signal: attackers are mixing old and new methods. Legacy botnet tactics, modern cloud abuse, AI assistance, and supply-chain exposure are being used side by side, whichever path gives the easiest foothold.

Below is the full weekly recap — a condensed scan of the incidents, flaws, and campaigns shaping the threat landscape right now.

Malicious Outlook Add-in Turns Into Phishing Kit — In an unusual case of a supply chain attack, the legitimate AgreeTo add-in for Outlook has been hijacked and turned into a phishing kit that stole more than 4,000 Microsoft account credentials. This was made possible by seizing control of a domain associated with the now-abandoned project to serve a fake Microsoft login page. The incident demonstrates how overlooked and abandoned assets turn into attack vectors. "What makes Office add-ins particularly concerning is the combination of factors: they run inside Outlook, where users handle their most sensitive communications, they can request permissions to read and modify emails, and they're distributed through Microsoft's own store, which carries implicit trust," Koi Security's Idan Dardikman said. Microsoft has since removed the add-in from its store.

Google Releases Fixes for Actively Exploited Chrome 0-Day — Google shipped security updates for its Chrome browser to address a flaw that it said has been exploited in the wild. The high-severity vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2026-2441 (CVSS score: 8.8), has been described as a use-after-free bug in CSS that could result in arbitrary code execution. Google did not disclose any details about how the vulnerability is being exploited in the wild, by whom, or who may have been targeted, but it acknowledged that "an exploit for CVE-2026-2441 exists in the wild." CVE-2026-2441 is the first actively exploited Chrome flaw patched by Google this year.

BeyondTrust Flaw Comes Under Active Exploitation — A newly disclosed critical vulnerability in BeyondTrust Remote Support and Privileged Remote Access products has come under active exploitation in the wild less than 24 hours after the publication of a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit. The vulnerability in question is CVE-2026-1731 (CVS score: 9.9), which could allow an unauthenticated attacker to achieve remote code execution by sending specially crafted requests. According to BeyondTrust, successful exploitation of the shortcoming could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute operating system commands in the context of the site user, resulting in unauthorized access, data exfiltration, and service disruption. Data from GreyNoise revealed that a single IP accounted for 86% of all observed reconnaissance sessions so far.

Apple Ships Patches for Actively Exploited 0-Day — Apple released iOS, iPadOS, macOS Tahoe, tvOS, watchOS, and visionOS updates to address a zero-day flaw that it said has been exploited in sophisticated cyber attacks against specific individuals on versions of iOS before iOS 26. The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2026-20700 (CVSS score: 7.8), has been described as a memory corruption issue in dyld, Apple's Dynamic Link Editor. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability could allow an attacker with memory write capability to execute arbitrary code on susceptible devices. Google Threat Analysis Group (TAG) has been credited with discovering and reporting the bug. The issue has been addressed in iOS 26.3, iPadOS 26.3, macOS Tahoe 26.3, tvOS 26.3, watchOS 26.3, and visionOS 26.3.

SSHStalker Uses IRC for C2 — A newly documented Linux botnet named SSHStalker is using the Internet Relay Chat (IRC) communication protocol for command-and-control (C2) operations. The SSHStalker botnet relies on classic IRC mechanics, prioritizing resilience, scale, and low-cost C2 over stealth and technical novelty. The toolkit achieves initial access through automated SSH scanning and brute forcing, using a Go binary that masquerades as the popular open-source network discovery utility nmap. Compromised hosts are then used to scan for additional SSH targets, allowing it to spread in a worm-like manner. Also dropped to infected hosts are payloads to escalate privileges using a catalog of 15-year-old CVEs, perform AWS key harvesting, and cryptocurrency mining. "What we actually found was a loud, stitched-together botnet kit that mixes old-school IRC control, compiling binaries on hosts, mass SSH compromise, and cron-based persistence," Flare said, describing it as a "scale-first operation that favors reliability over stealth."

TeamPCP Turns Cloud Infrastructure into Cybercrime Bots — A threat cluster known as TeamPCP is systematically targeting misconfigured and exposed cloud native environments to hijack infrastructure, expand its scale, and monetize its operations through cryptocurrency mining, proxyware, data theft, and extortion. TeamPCP's modus operandi involves scanning broad IP ranges for exposed Docker APIs, Kubernetes clusters, Redis servers, Ray dashboards, and systems susceptible to the React2Shell vulnerability in React Server Components. Once it gains access to a system, the threat actor deploys malicious Python and Shell scripts that pull down additional payloads to install proxies, tunneling software, and other components that enable persistence even after server reboots. The varied end goals of the operation ensure that TeamPCP has several revenue streams as "every compromised system becomes a scanner, a proxy, a miner, a data exfiltration node, and a launchpad for further attacks," Flare said. "Kubernetes clusters are not merely breached; they are converted into distributed botnets."

State-Sponsored Hackers Use AI at All Stages of Attack Cycle — Google said it found evidence of nation-state hacking groups using its artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot Gemini at nearly every stage of the cyber attack cycle. The findings once again underscore how such tools are being increasingly integrated into malicious operations, even if they don't equip bad actors with novel capabilities. One major area of concern with AI abuse is automating the development of vulnerability exploitation, allowing attackers to move faster than the defenders, necessitating that companies respond quickly and fix security weaknesses. Gemini is being weaponized in other ways too, Google said, with some bad actors embedding its APIs directly into malicious code. This includes a new malware family called HONESTCUE that sends prompts to generate working code that the malware compiles and executes in memory. The prompts appear benign in isolation and "devoid of any context related to malware," allowing them to bypass Gemini's safety filters.

Nation-State Hackers Go After Defense Industrial Base — Digital threats targeting the defense industrial base (DIB) sector are expanding beyond traditional espionage into supply chain attacks, workforce infiltration, and cyber operations that lend nations a strategic advantage on the battlefield. The development comes as the cyber domain becomes increasingly intertwined with national defense. Google Threat Intelligence Group said the DIB sector faces a "relentless barrage" of cyber operations conducted by state-sponsored actors and criminal groups. These activities are primarily driven by Chinese, Iranian, North Korean, and Russian threat actors. This is also complemented by pre-positioning efforts to gain covert access through zero-day vulnerabilities in edge network devices to maintain persistent access for future strategic advantage. "In modern warfare, the front lines are no longer confined to the battlefield; they extend directly into the servers and supply chains of the industry that safeguards the nation," the tech giant said.

New vulnerabilities surface daily, and attackers move fast. Reviewing and patching early keeps your systems resilient.

Here are this week’s most critical flaws to check first — CVE-2026-2441 (Google Chrome), CVE-2026-20700 (Apple iOS, iPadOS, macOS Tahoe, tvOS, watchOS, and visionOS), CVE-2026-21510, CVE-2026-21513, CVE-2026-21514, CVE-2026-21519, CVE-2026-21525, CVE-2026-21533 (Microsoft Windows), CVE-2026-1731 (BeyondTrust Remote Support and Privileged Remote Access), CVE-2026-1774 (CASL Ability), CVE-2026-25639 (Axios), CVE-2026-25646 (libpng), CVE-2026-1357 (WPvivid Backup & Migration plugin), CVE-2026-0969 (next-mdx-remote), CVE-2026-25881 (SandboxJS), CVE-2025-66630 (Fiber v2), and a path traversal vulnerability in PyMuPDF (no CVE).

📰 Around the Cyber World

DragonForce Ransomware Cartel Detailed — In a new analysis, S2W detailed the workings of DragonForce, a ransomware group active since December 2023 that operates under a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) model and promotes itself as a cartel to expand its influence. The group has carried out attacks against 363 companies from December 2023 to January 2026, while affiliating with LockBit and Qilin. DragonForce also maintains the RansomBay service to support affiliates with customized payload generation and configuration options. In addition, it is active on several dark web forums, including BreachForums, RAMP, and Exploit to advertise its RaaS operations and recruit pentesters. "DragonForce has been expanding its operational scope through attacks on other groups as well as through cooperative relationships, which is assessed as an effort to strengthen its position within the ransomware ecosystem," S2W said.

New Browser Fingerprinting Technique Uses Ad Block Filters — Aș browser fingerprinting techniques continue to evolve, new research has found that country-specific adblock filter lists installed on the browser can be used to de-anonymize VPN users. The approach has been codenamed Adbleed by security researcher Melvin Lammerts. "Users of ad blockers with country-specific filter lists (e.g., EasyList Germany, Liste FR) can be partially de-anonymized even when using a VPN," the researcher said. "By probing blocked domains unique to each country's filter list, we can identify which lists are active, revealing the user's likely country or language. If 20+ out of 30 probed domains are blocked instantly, we conclude that the country's filter list is active."

China's Tianfu Cup Makes a Quiet Return in 2026 — China's Tianfu Cup hacking contest made its return in 2026, and is now being overseen by the government. Tianfu Cup was launched in 2018 as an alternative to the Zero Day Initiative's Pwn2Own competition to demonstrate critical vulnerabilities in consumer and enterprise hardware and software, industrial control systems, and automotive products. Tianfu Cup attracted attention in 2021 when participants earned a total of $1.88 million for exploits targeting Windows, Ubuntu, iOS, Safari, Google Chrome, Microsoft Exchange, Adobe Reader, Docker, and VMware. While Tianfu Cup skipped 2022, 2024, and 2025, it popped up in 2023 with a focus on domestic products from companies such as Huawei, Xiaomi, Tencent, and Qihoo 360. After a two-year hiatus in 2024 and 2025, Tianfu Cup once again reappeared late last month. According to Natto Thoughts, the hacking competition is now organized by China's Ministry of Public Security (MPS). With regulations implemented by China in 2021 requiring citizens to report zero-day vulnerabilities to the government, it has raised concerns that Chinese nation-state threat actors have been leveraging the law to stockpile zero-days for cyber espionage operations.

DoD Employee Indicted for Moonlighting as a Money Mule — A Department of Defense (DoD) employee, Samuel D. Marcus, has been indicted in the U.S. for allegedly serving as a money mule and laundering millions of dollars on behalf of Nigerian scammers. Marcus has been charged with one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering, six counts of illegal monetary transactions, and one count of money laundering. "From approximately July 2023 to December 2025, while employed as a Logistics Specialist with the Department of Defense, the defendant was in direct and regular contact with a group of Nigeria-based fraudsters, who operated under the aliases 'Rachel Jude' and 'Ned McMurray,' among others," the U.S. Justice Department (DoJ) said. "These fraudsters engaged in a variety of wire fraud schemes that targeted victims based in the United States, including romance fraud, cyber fraud, tax fraud, financing fraud, and business email compromise schemes, to which victims lost millions of dollars." The indictment alleged that the defendant and other money mules conducted a series of financial transactions to convert fraud victim funds deposited into their accounts into cryptocurrency and to move those funds into foreign accounts. If convicted, Marcus faces a maximum possible sentence of 100 years’ imprisonment, three years’ supervised release, and a $2 million fine.

Palo Alto Networks Chose Not to tie TGR-STA-1030 to China — In a report published last week, Reuters said Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 opted not to attribute China to a sprawling cyber espionage campaign dubbed TGR-STA-1030 that it said broke into the networks of at least 70 government and critical infrastructure organizations across 37 countries over the past year. The decision was motivated "over concerns that the cybersecurity company or its clients could face retaliation from Beijing," the news agency said. It's worth noting that the campaign exhibits typical hallmarks associated with a typical China-nexus espionage effort, not least because of the use of tools like Behinder, neo-reGeorg, and Godzilla, which have been primarily identified as used by Chinese hacking groups in the past.

Trend Micro Details New Threat Actor Taxonomy — Trend Micro has outlined a new threat attribution framework that applies standardized evidence scoring, relationship mapping, and bias testing to reduce the risk of misattribution. The naming convention includes Earth for espionage, Water for financially motivated operations, Fire for destructive or disruptive actors, Wind for hacktivists, Aether for unknown motivation, and Void for mixed motivation. "Strong attribution comes from weighing evidence correctly," Trend Micro said. "Not all evidence carries the same weight, and effective attribution depends on separating high-value intelligence from disposable indicators. Attribution confidence comes from signals that persist over time. Quantifying evidence quality through consistent scoring prevents analysts from overvaluing noise or intuition, helps challenge assumptions, and keeps the focus on signals that genuinely strengthen the overall attribution case rather than isolated data points that do not move it forward."

Cryptocurrency Flows to Suspected Human Trafficking Services Surge — Cryptocurrency flows to suspected human trafficking services, largely based in Southeast Asia, grew 85% in 2025, reaching a scale of hundreds of millions across identified services. "This surge in cryptocurrency flows to suspected human trafficking services is not happening in isolation, but is closely aligned with the growth of Southeast Asia–based scam compounds, online casinos and gambling sites, and Chinese-language money laundering (CMLN) and guarantee networks operating largely via Telegram, all of which form a rapidly expanding local illicit ecosystem with global reach and impact," Chainalysis said.

Security Flaw in Munge — A high-severity vulnerability has been disclosed in Munge that could allow a local attacker to leak cryptographic key material from process memory, and use it to forge arbitrary Munge credentials to impersonate any user, including root, to services that rely on it for authentication. Munge is an authentication service for creating and validating user credentials that's designed for use in high-performance computing (HPC) cluster environments. The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2026-25506 (CVSS score: 7.7), has been present in the codebase for approximately 20 years, per Lexfo. It affects every version up to 0.5.17, and has been addressed in version 0.5.18, released on February 10, 2026. "This vulnerability can be exploited locally to leak the Munge secret key, allowing an attacker to forge arbitrary Munge tokens, valid across the cluster," Lexfo said. "In a way, this is a local privilege escalation in the context of high-performance computers."

New Campaign Distributes Lumma Stealer and Trojanized Chromium-Based Ninja Browser — A large-scale malware campaign has been exploiting trusted Google services, including Google Groups, Google Docs, and Google Drive, to distribute Lumma Stealer and a trojanized Chromium-based Ninja Browser on Windows and Linux systems. The attack chain involves the threat actor embedding malicious download links disguised as software updates, often using URL shorteners, in Google Groups to trick users into installing malware. Central to the attack is the abuse of the inherent trust associated with Google-hosted platforms to bypass conventional security controls and increase the likelihood of successful compromise. "The operation leverages more than 4,000 malicious Google Groups and 3,500 Google-hosted URLs to embed deceptive download links within legitimate-looking discussions, targeting organizations worldwide," CTM360 said. "The campaign dynamically redirects victims based on the operating system, delivering an oversized, obfuscated Lumma payload to Windows users and a persistence-enabled malicious browser to Linux systems."

Disney Agrees to $2.75M Fine for Data Privacy Violations — Walt Disney has agreed to a $2.75 million fine with the U.S. state of California in response to allegations that it broke the state's privacy law, the California Consumer Protection Act, by making it difficult for consumers to opt out of having their data shared and sold. The company has also agreed to implement opt-out methods that fully stop Disney's sale or sharing of consumers' personal information. "Consumers shouldn't have to go to infinity and beyond to assert their privacy rights," said California Attorney General Rob Bonta. "California's nation-leading privacy law is clear: A consumer's opt-out right applies wherever and however a business sells data — businesses can’t force people to go device-by-device or service-by-service. In California, asking a business to stop selling your data should not be complicated or cumbersome. My office is committed to the continued enforcement of this critical privacy law."

Leaked Credentials Exposed Airport Systems to Security Risks — CloudSEK said it discovered login credentials for a European fourth-party airport service portal being circulated on underground forums, potentially allowing threat actors unauthorized access to an unnamed vendor's Next Generation Operations Support System (NGOSS) systems at approximately 200 airports across multiple countries. "The portal, which served as the central control panel for over 200 client airports, lacked Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)," CloudSEK said. "No breach occurred — but the potential for one was immediate and severe."

🔧 Cybersecurity Tools

SCAM (Security Comprehension Awareness Measure) — It is a benchmark by 1Password that tests how safely AI agents handle sensitive information in real workplace situations. Instead of asking agents to identify obvious scams, it places them inside everyday tasks—email, credentials, web forms—where hidden threats like phishing links and fake domains appear naturally. The goal is to measure whether AI can recognize, avoid, and report risks before damage happens.

Quantickle — It is a browser-based graph visualization tool designed to help analysts map and explore threat intelligence data. It turns complex relationships—IPs, domains, malware, actors—into interactive network graphs, making patterns, connections, and attack paths easier to see, investigate, and explain.

Disclaimer: These tools are provided for research and educational use only. They are not security-audited and may cause harm if misused. Review the code, test in controlled environments, and comply with all applicable laws and policies.

Taken together, these incidents show how threat activity is spreading across every layer. User tools, enterprise software, cloud infrastructure, and national systems are all in scope. The entry points differ, but the objective stays the same: gain access quietly, then scale impact over time.

The stories above are not isolated alerts. Read as a whole, they outline where pressure is building next and where defenses are most likely to be tested in the weeks ahead.

[2] The Hacker News - Safe and Inclusive E‑Society: How Lithuania Is Bracing for AI‑Driven Cyber Fraud
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[TAM METİN - 1308 kelime]
Technologies are evolving fast, reshaping economies, governance, and daily life. Yet, as innovation accelerates, so do digital risks. Technological change is no longer abstract for such a country as Lithuania, as well. From e-signatures to digital health records, the country depends on secure systems.

Cybersecurity has become not only a technical challenge but a societal one – demanding the cooperation of scientists, business leaders, and policymakers. In Lithuania, this cooperation has taken a concrete form – the government-funded national initiative. Coordinated by the Innovation Agency Lithuania, the project aims to strengthen the country’s e-security and digital resilience.

Under this umbrella, universities and companies with long-standing expertise are working hand in hand to transform scientific knowledge into market-ready, high-value innovations. Several of these solutions are already being tested in real environments, for example, in public institutions and critical infrastructure operators. As Martynas Survilas, Director of the Innovation Development Department at the Innovation Agency Lithuania, explains:

“Our goal is to turn Lithuania’s scientific potential into real impact – solutions that protect citizens, reinforce trust in digital services, and help build an inclusive, innovative economy. The era of isolated research is over. In practice, science and business must work together to keep pace with complex, multilayered threats.”

A National Mission: Safe and Inclusive E-Society

Among three strategic national missions launched under this program, one stands out for its relevance to the global digital landscape: “Safe and Inclusive E-Society”, coordinated by Kaunas University of Technology (KTU).

The mission aims to increase cyber resilience and reduce the risks of personal data breaches, with a focus on everyday users of public and private e-services, contributing directly to Lithuania’s transformation into a secure, digitally empowered society. Its total value exceeds €24.1 million.

The KTU consortium includes top Lithuanian universities – Vilnius Tech and Mykolas Romeris University – as well as leading cybersecurity companies such as NRD Cyber Security, Elsis PRO, Transcendent Group Baltics, and the Baltic Institute of Advanced Technology, together with industry association Infobalt and the Lithuanian Cybercrime Competence, Research and Education Center.

The mission’s research and development efforts cover a broad spectrum of cybersecurity challenges that define today’s digital landscape. Teams are developing smart, adaptive, and self-learning buildings. In the financial sector, new AI-driven defense systems are being built to protect FinTech companies and their users from fraud and data breaches. Industrial safety is strengthened through prototypes of threat-detection sensors for critical infrastructure, while hybrid threat management systems are being tailored for use in public safety, education, and business environments. Other research focuses on combating disinformation through AI models that automatically detect coordinated bot and troll activity, as well as on creating intelligent platforms for automated cyber threat intelligence and real-time analysis.

AI Fraud: A New Kind of Threat

According to Dr. Rasa Brūzgienė, Associate Professor at the Department of Computer Sciences at Kaunas University of Technology, the emergence of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) has fundamentally changed the logic of fraud against e-government services.

“Until now, the main defense relied on pattern-based detection – for example, automated filters and firewalls could recognize recurring fraud patterns, typical phrases or structures,” she explains. “However, GenAI has eliminated that ‘pattern’ boundary. Today, criminals can use generative models to create contextually accurate messages. Models know how to write without grammatical errors, use precise terminology, and even replicate the communication style of institutions. This means that modern phishing emails no longer resemble ‘classic fraud’ but become difficult to recognize even for humans, let alone automated filters.”

She emphasizes that both the scale and the quality of attacks have evolved: “The scale has increased because GenAI allows for the automated generation of thousands of different, non-repeating fraudulent messages. The quality has increased because these messages are personalized, multilingual, and often based on publicly available information about the victim. The result: traditional firewalls and spam filters lose their effectiveness because their detectors can no longer rely on formal features of words, phrases, or structure. The main change is no longer mass scale, but realism. In other words, modern attacks don’t look like fraud – they look like normal legal communication.”

Criminals today, Dr. Brūzgienė warns, have access to a broad arsenal of AI tools. They use models such as GPT-4, GPT-5, Claude, and open-source alternatives like Llama, Falcon, and Mistral – as well as darker variants such as FraudGPT, WormGPT, or GhostGPT, specifically designed for malicious activities. “They can clone voices using ElevenLabs or Microsoft’s VALL-E from just a few seconds of someone speaking. For creating fake faces and videos, they use StyleGAN, Stable Diffusion, DALL-E, and DeepFaceLab, along with lip-sync solutions like Wav2Lip and First-Order-Motion,” she notes.

Even more concerning, she adds, is how these tools are orchestrated together: “Criminals produce photorealistic face photos, deepfake videos, and document copies with meticulously edited metadata. LLMs generate high-quality, personalized phishing texts and onboarding dialogues, TTS and voice-cloning models recreate a victim’s or employee’s voice, and image generation tools produce ‘liveness’ videos that fool verification systems. Automated AI agents then handle the rest – creating accounts, uploading documents, and responding to challenges. These multimodal chains can bypass both automated and human verification based on trust.”

“The scary part,” Dr. Brūzgienė concludes, “is how accessible all of this has become. Commercial TTS solutions like ElevenLabs and open-source implementations of VALL-E provide high-quality voice cloning to anyone. Stable Diffusion, DeepFaceLab, and similar tools make it easy to generate photorealistic images or deepfakes quickly. Because of this accessibility, a single operator can create hundreds of convincing, different, yet interconnected fake profiles in a short time. We are already seeing such cases in attempts to open fake accounts in financial institutions and crypto platforms.”

AI-Powered Social Engineering

Another new frontier is adaptive AI-driven social engineering. Attackers no longer rely on static scripts – they use LLMs that adapt to a victim’s reactions in real time.

Bots start with automated reconnaissance, scraping social media, professional directories, and leaked databases to build personalized profiles. Then, the LLM crafts initial messages that mirror a person’s professional tone or institutional language. If there’s no response, the system automatically switches channels – from email to SMS or Slack – and changes tone from formal to urgent. If a target hesitates, the AI generates plausible reassurance, quoting real internal policies or procedures.

In one typical scenario, a “colleague” writes via work email, follows up on LinkedIn, and then calls using a cloned voice – all orchestrated by connected AI tools. Dr. Brūzgienė describes this as a new stage of cybercrime evolution: “Social engineering has become scalable, intelligent, and deeply personal. Each victim experiences a unique, evolving deception designed to exploit their psychological and behavioral weak points.”

Lithuania’s Cyber Defense Leadership

Lithuania’s digital ecosystem – known for its advanced e-government architecture and centralized electronic identity (eID) systems – faces unique challenges. However, it also demonstrates remarkable progress. The country has risen steadily in international indices, ranking 25th globally in the Chandler Good Government Index (CGGI) and 33rd in the Government AI Readiness Index (2025).

Lithuania’s AI strategy (2021–2030), updated in 2025, has prioritized AI-driven cyber defense, anomaly detection, and resilience-building. The National Cyber Security Centre (NKSC) integrates AI into threat monitoring, reducing ransomware incidents by fivefold between 2023 and 2024. Collaboration with NATO, ENISA, and EU partners further enhances Lithuania’s hybrid defense capabilities.

“We see cyber resilience not just as a technical task but as a foundation for democracy and economic growth,” says Survilas. “Through the safe and inclusive e-society mission, we are not only protecting our digital infrastructure but also empowering citizens to trust and participate in the digital world. AI will inevitably be used for malicious purposes, but we can also use AI to defend. The key is collaboration across sectors and continuous education. This mission is one of the tools helping us turn that idea into concrete projects, pilots, and services for people in Lithuania.”

[3] The Hacker News - New ZeroDayRAT Mobile Spyware Enables Real-Time Surveillance and Data Theft
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Mon, 16 Feb 2026 15:54:00 +0530
Link: https://thehackernews.com/2026/02/new-zerodayrat-mobile-spyware-enables.html

[TAM METİN - 1538 kelime]
Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed details of a new mobile spyware platform dubbed ZeroDayRAT that's being advertised on Telegram as a way to grab sensitive data and facilitate real-time surveillance on Android and iOS devices.

"The developer runs dedicated channels for sales, customer support, and regular updates, giving buyers a single point of access to a fully operational spyware panel," Daniel Kelley, security researcher at iVerify, said. "The platform goes beyond typical data collection into real-time surveillance and direct financial theft."

ZeroDayRAT is designed to support Android versions 5 through 16 and iOS versions up to 26. It's assessed that the malware is distributed via social engineering or fake app marketplaces. The malicious binaries are generated through a builder that's provided to buyers along with an online panel that they can set up on their own server.

Once the malware infects a device, the operator gets to see all the details, including model, location, operating system, battery status, SIM, carrier details, app usage, notifications, and a preview of recent SMS messages, through a self-hosted panel. This information allows the threat actor to profile the victim and glean more about who they talk to and the apps they use the most.

The panel also extracts their current GPS coordinates and plots them on Google Maps, along with the history of all locations they have been to over time, effectively turning it into spyware.

"One of the more problematic panels is the accounts tab," Kelley added. "Every account registered on the device is enumerated: Google, WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook, Telegram, Amazon, Flipkart, PhonePe, Paytm, Spotify, and more, each with its associated username or email."

Some of the other capabilities of ZeroDayRAT include logging keystrokes, gathering SMS messages -- including one-time passwords (OTPs) to defeat two-factor authentication, as well as allowing hands-on operations, such as activating real-time surveillance via live camera streaming and a microphone feed that allows the adversary to remotely monitor a victim.

To enable financial theft, the malware incorporates a stealer component that scans for wallet apps like MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Binance, and Coinbase, and substitutes wallet addresses copied to the clipboard to reroute transactions to a wallet under the attacker's control.

There also exists a bank stealer module to target online mobile wallet platforms like Apple Pay, Google Pay, PayPal, along with PhonePe, an Indian digital payments application that allows instant money transfers with the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), a protocol to facilitate inter-bank peer-to-peer and person-to-merchant transactions.

"Taken together, this is a complete mobile compromise toolkit, the kind that used to require nation-state investment or bespoke exploit development, now sold on Telegram," Kelley said. "A single buyer gets full access to a target's location, messages, finances, camera, microphone, and keystrokes from a browser tab. Cross-platform support and active development make it a growing threat to both individuals and organizations."

The ZeroDayRAT malware is similar to numerous others that have targeted mobile device users, either via phishing or by infiltrating official app marketplaces. Over the past few years, bad actors have repeatedly managed to find various ways to bypass security protections put in place by Apple and Google to trick users into installing malicious apps.

Attacks targeting Apple's iOS have typically leveraged an enterprise provisioning capability that allows organizations to install apps without the need for publishing them to the App Store. By marketing tools that combine spyware, surveillance, and information-stealing capabilities, they further lower the barrier of entry for less skilled hackers. They also highlight the evolving sophistication and persistence of mobile-focused cyber threats.

News of the commercial spyware platform coincides with the emergence of various mobile malware and scam campaigns that have come to light in recent weeks -

An Android remote access trojan (RAT) campaign has used Hugging Face to host and distribute malicious APK files. The infection chain begins when users download a seemingly harmless dropper app (e.g., TrustBastion) that, when opened, prompts users to install an update, which causes the app to download the APK file hosted on Hugging Face. The malware then requests accessibility permissions and access to other sensitive controls to enable surveillance and credential theft.

An Android RAT called Arsink has been found to use Google Apps Script for media and file exfiltration to Google Drive, in addition to relying on Firebase and Telegram for C2. The malware, which allows data theft and complete remote control, is distributed via Telegram, Discord, and MediaFire links, while impersonating various popular brands. Arsink infections have been concentrated in Egypt, Indonesia, Iraq, Yemen, and Türkiye.

A document reader app named All Document Reader (package name: com.recursivestd.highlogic.stellargrid) uploaded to the Google Play Store has been flagged for acting as an installer for the Anatsa (aka TeaBot and Toddler) banking trojan. The app attracted over 50,000 downloads before it was taken down.

An Android banking trojan called deVixor has been actively targeting Iranian users through phishing websites that impersonate legitimate automotive businesses since October 2025. Besides harvesting sensitive information, the malware includes a remotely triggered ransomware module capable of locking devices and demanding cryptocurrency payments. It uses Google Firebase for command delivery and Telegram-based bot infrastructure for administration.

A malicious campaign codenamed ShadowRemit has exploited fake Android apps and pages mimicking Google Play app listings to enable unlicensed cross-border money transfers. These bogus pages have been found to promote unauthorized APKs as trusted remittance services with zero fees and improved exchange rates. "Victims are instructed to send payments to beneficiary accounts/eWallet endpoints and provide transaction screenshots as proof for verification," CTM360 said. "This approach can bypass regulated remittance corridors and aligns with mule-account collection patterns."

An Android malware campaign targeting users in India has abused the trust associated with government services and official digital platforms to distribute malicious APK files through WhatsApp, leading to the deployment of malware that can steal data, establish persistent control, and run a cryptocurrency miner.

The operators of an Android trojan and cybercrime tool called Triada have been observed using phishing landing pages disguised as Chrome browser updates to trick users into downloading malicious APK files hosted on GitHub. According to an analysis by Alex, attackers are "actively taking over long-standing, fully verified advertiser accounts to distribute malicious redirects."

A WhatApp-oriented scam campaign has leveraged video calls, in which the threat actor poses as a bank representative or a Meta support and instructs them to share their phone's screen to address a purported unauthorized charge on their credit card, and install a legitimate remote access app, such as AnyDesk or TeamViewer, to steal sensitive data.

An Android spyware campaign has leveraged romance scam tactics to target individuals in Pakistan to distribute a malicious dating chat app dubbed GhostChat to exfiltrate victims' data. It's currently not known how the malware is distributed. The threat actors behind the operation are also suspected to be running a ClickFix attack that infects victims' computers with a DLL payload that can gather system metadata and run commands issued by an external server, as well as a WhatsApp device-linking attack called GhostPairing to gain access to their WhatsApp accounts.

A new family of Android click fraud trojans called Phantom has been found to leverage TensorFlow.js, a JavaScript machine learning library, to automatically detect and interact with specific advertisement elements on a site loaded in a hidden WebView. An alternative "signaling" mode uses WebRTC to stream a live video feed of the virtual browser screen to the attackers' server and allow them to click, scroll, or enter text. The malware is distributed via mobile games published to Xiaomi's GetApps store and other unofficial, third-party app stores.

An Android malware family called NFCShare has been distributed via a Deutsche Bank phishing campaign to deceive users into installing a malicious APK file ("deutsche.apk") under the pretext of an update, which reads NFC card data and exfiltrates it to a remote WebSocket endpoint. The malware shares similarities with NFC relay malware families like NGate, ZNFC, SuperCard X, PhantomCard, and RelayNFC, with its command-and-control (C2) server previously flagged as associated with SuperCard X activity in November 2025.

In a report published last month, Group-IB said it has witnessed a surge in NFC-enabled Android tap-to-pay malware, most of which is advertised within Chinese cybercrime communities on Telegram. The NFC-based relay technique is also referred to as Ghost Tap.

"At least $355,000 in illegitimate transactions have been recorded from one POS vendor alone throughout November 2024 – August 2025," the Singapore-headquartered cybersecurity company said. "In another observed scenario, mobile wallets preloaded with compromised cards are used by mules across the globe to make purchases."

The end goal of these attacks is to trick victims into installing NFC-enabled malware and tapping their physical payment cards on their smartphone, causing the transaction data to be captured and relayed to the cybercriminal's device through an attacker-controlled server. This is achieved by means of a dedicated app installed on the money mule's device to complete payments or cash-out as though the victims' cards were physically present.

Calling tap-to-pay scams a growing concern, Group-IB said it observed a steady increase in the detection of malware artifacts between May 2024 and December 2025. "At the same time, different families and variants are also appearing, while the old ones remain active," it added. "This indicates the spread of this technology among fraudsters."

[4] BleepingComputer - Passwords to passkeys: Staying ISO 27001 compliant in a passwordless era

[TAM METİN - 2430 kelime]
One morning, you wake up and realize that your business has grown to the point where you can no longer afford to get into that old, worn-out diesel subcompact. Instead, you schedule a test drive of a brand-new electric vehicle. The business transitioning from password-based security to passkey technology experiences a similarly transformative feeling. Now, let's dive into the details and break it down thoroughly!

Passwords have powered digital authentication for decades — much like an old diesel subcompact that somehow keeps starting every morning. But the engine is coughing. The doors don't lock properly. Anyone who knows the trick can jiggle the handle and get in.

Research shows that 49% of security incidents involve compromised passwords, according to Verizon's 2023 Data Breach Investigations Report, while 84% of users admit to reusing the same password across multiple accounts — creating a cascade of vulnerabilities. These are not minor inconveniences — they are warning lights flashing on the dashboard, signaling systemic risk.

Passwordless authentication, particularly through passkeys, is like upgrading to a high-tech bullet car: faster, sleeker, and nearly impossible to derail. The ride is smoother, quieter, and significantly harder to hijack.

For organizations under ISO/IEC 27001, switching from passwords to passkeys is less like a casual upgrade and more like overhauling an entire airline fleet to meet stringent new safety standards. It requires ensuring that the new drivetrain aligns with established controls, risk treatment plans, and documentation obligations.

This article examines how organizations can transition to passkeys while maintaining ISO/IEC 27001 compliance — covering the technical foundations and offering practical guidance for IT professionals navigating this modernization journey.

How passwordless authentication works: Technical foundations

Passwordless authentication eliminates the cognitive burden of remembering passwords. Authentication relies on cryptographic keys, biometrics, or possession-based factors — what you have or what you are.

Passkeys represent the most mature implementation of this approach. Passkeys, built on FIDO2 and WebAuthn standards, are like the latest GPS technology — they guide you securely to your destination without the risk of getting lost or taking a wrong turn.

When you create a passkey, your device generates a cryptographic key pair: a private key that stays locked on your device, and a public key that's registered with the service. During authentication, the service sends a challenge, your device signs it with the private key, and the service verifies the signature. Because the private key never leaves your device, attackers have nothing to intercept or phish.

NIST's Digital Identity Guidelines (SP 800-63B) classify authentication methods by Authenticator Assurance Level (AAL). Passkeys typically meet AAL2 or AAL3 requirements, representing a significant security upgrade over traditional password-based authentication.

Modern passkeys come in two flavors: device-bound (stored in hardware like security keys) and syncable (backed up across devices through encrypted cloud services). NIST's updated guidance from August 2024 explicitly addresses syncable authenticators, recognizing that users who lose their only authentication method face significant access recovery challenges.

The adoption numbers tell a compelling story. FIDO Alliance reports that more than 15 billion online accounts now support passkeys — double the figure from 2023. Amazon has created 175 million passkeys, while Google reports 800 million accounts with passkeys enabled. The revolution is already underway.

ISO/IEC 27001 compliance requirements

ISO/IEC 27001 is like a detailed road map for navigating the complex terrain of information security risks, ensuring you don't take a wrong turn. The 2022 revision reorganized Annex A controls into four themes: organizational, people, physical, and technological.

Authentication falls primarily under three controls:

Annex A 5.15 (Access Control) defines rules and rights for accessing information and systems. Organizations must establish policies covering user authentication, authorization, access provisioning, and access revocation procedures.

Annex A 5.15 (Access Control) defines rules and rights for accessing information and systems. Organizations must establish policies covering user authentication, authorization, access provisioning, and access revocation procedures.

Annex A 5.17 (Authentication Information) requires organization-wide procedures for allocating and managing authentication credentials, including documenting authentication methods and protecting authentication data.

Annex A 5.17 (Authentication Information) requires organization-wide procedures for allocating and managing authentication credentials, including documenting authentication methods and protecting authentication data.

Annex A 8.5 (Secure Authentication) specifies technical implementation requirements, including multi-factor authentication for privileged access.

Annex A 8.5 (Secure Authentication) specifies technical implementation requirements, including multi-factor authentication for privileged access.

For organizations with ISO/IEC 27001 certification, adopting passkeys requires demonstrating that the new authentication method meets or exceeds existing control objectives, that risks have been properly assessed, and that implementation is thoroughly documented.

Mapping passwordless adoption to ISO/IEC 27001 controls

Transitioning to passkeys touches multiple ISO/IEC 27001 controls. Here's how to align your implementation:

A 5.15 (Access Control)

Define passkey scope by risk level: device-bound passkeys for privileged accounts (AAL3), syncable passkeys for standard users (AAL2)

Establish monitoring procedures for detecting and responding to new attack vectors

Organizations should prioritize device-bound passkeys (AAL3) for privileged accounts and syncable passkeys (AAL2) for standard users. Document fallback procedures, encryption standards, and re-enrollment triggers to satisfy auditor requirements.

Real-world implementation data reveals benefits beyond theoretical threat modeling.  Google reports that passkeys eliminate password-based attacks entirely for accounts that use them exclusively, with a 30% improvement in authentication success rates and 20% faster sign-in times. Sony PlayStation observed an 88% conversion rate for users who started enrollment.

Password management creates ongoing operational costs through help desk calls for password resets, account lockouts, administrative overhead, oil changes, new tires, you get it? Gartner reports that password-related issues account for 20-40% of all help desk calls, with each reset costing organizations an average of $70 in direct support time.

Microsoft's shift to passkeys as the default sign-in method for all new accounts, supporting over 1 billion users, represents a significant industry move away from this support burden. These costs accumulate quickly across enterprise environments with thousands of users.

Passkeys naturally align with multiple compliance requirements: NIST AAL2/AAL3 phishing-resistant authentication, PCI DSS 4.0 multi-factor authentication, GDPR reduced personal data exposure, and SOC 2 strong access controls. For organizations juggling multiple compliance frameworks, passkeys provide a single technical control that addresses requirements across standards.

Challenges and misconceptions

Passkeys significantly improve security, but implementation requires understanding their limitations. As an electric vehicle won't take you 1,000 miles on a single charge the way diesel would. Modern technology requires modern infrastructure — charging stations, service networks, trained technicians. Passkeys face similar dependencies.

Passkeys aren't completely phishing-proof

While passkeys resist traditional credential phishing, attackers adapt. Downgrade attacks force users back to passwords by manipulating authentication pages. Device code phishing and OAuth consent attacks bypass passkey protections entirely.

These attacks don't compromise passkey cryptography — they exploit implementation choices and user behavior. Organizations should:

Monitor for downgrade attempts

Disable password fallback where possible

Train users to recognize suspicious authentication flows

Account recovery complexity

If a user loses their device and hasn't backed up their passkey, they've lost their authentication credential. Recovery approaches include:

Email-based recovery (reintroduces email compromise as an attack vector)

Backup passkeys on multiple devices

Manual identity verification by administrators

Recovery codes generated during enrollment

Each approach has security implications that your ISO/IEC 27001 documentation should address in detail.

Mixed authentication environments

Few organizations can go fully passwordless overnight. During transition periods, you'll operate mixed environments where some users authenticate with passkeys while others use passwords. This creates:

Inconsistent security posture — Your most sensitive systems may rely on passkeys while legacy applications still accept weak passwords, creating exploitable gaps.

Best practices for implementation

Prioritize by risk — Start with privileged accounts (administrators, developers with production access, users handling sensitive data). Document your prioritization rationale to demonstrate the risk-based thinking that ISO/IEC 27001 demands.

The test drive is over: Time to sign the papers?

Your old password-based authentication still gets you from point A to point B — but is it ready for tomorrow's journey? Passkeys don't eliminate all authentication risks, but organizations that build adaptable authentication frameworks today will be better positioned to incorporate emerging technologies while maintaining rigorous security governance.

Passkeys represent a fundamental shift in authentication security, offering measurable improvements in security, user experience, and operational efficiency. For ISO/IEC 27001-compliant organizations, success requires risk-based prioritization, comprehensive documentation, and thoughtful management of the transition period.

[5] BleepingComputer - CISA gives feds 3 days to patch actively exploited BeyondTrust flaw
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Mon, 16 Feb 2026 07:33:11 -0500
Link: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cisa-orders-feds-to-patch-beyondtrust-flaw-within-three-days/

[TAM METİN - 550 kelime]
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) ordered federal agencies on Friday to secure their BeyondTrust Remote Support instances against an actively exploited vulnerability within three days.

BeyondTrust provides identity security services to more than 20,000 customers across over 100 countries, including government agencies and 75% of Fortune 100 companies worldwide.

Tracked as CVE-2026-1731, this remote code execution vulnerability stems from an OS command injection weakness and affects BeyondTrust's Remote Support 25.3.1 or earlier and Privileged Remote Access 24.3.4 or earlier.

While BeyondTrust patched all Remote Support and Privileged Remote Access SaaS instances on February 2, 2026, on-premise customers must install patches manually.

"Successful exploitation could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute operating system commands in the context of the site user," BeyondTrust said when it patched the vulnerability on February 6. "Successful exploitation requires no authentication or user interaction and may lead to system compromise, including unauthorized access, data exfiltration, and service disruption."

Hacktron, who discovered the vulnerability and responsibly disclosed it to BeyondTrust on January 31, warned that approximately 11,000 BeyondTrust Remote Support instances were exposed online, around 8,500 of them being on-premises deployments.

On Thursday, six days after BeyondTrust released CVE-2026-1731 security patches, watchTowr head of threat intelligence Ryan Dewhurst reported that attackers are now actively exploiting the security flaw, warning admins that unpatched devices should be assumed to be compromised.

Federal agencies ordered to patch immediately

One day later, CISA confirmed Dewhurst's report, added the vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, and ordered Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to secure their BeyondTrust instances by the end of Monday, February 16, as mandated by Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01.

"These types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise," the U.S. cybersecurity agency warned. "Apply mitigations per vendor instructions, follow applicable BOD 22-01 guidance for cloud services, or discontinue use of the product if mitigations are unavailable."

CISA's warning comes on the heels of other BeyondTrust security flaws that were exploited to compromise the systems of U.S. government agencies.

For instance, the U.S. Treasury Department revealed two years ago that its network had been hacked in an incident linked to the Silk Typhoon,  a notorious Chinese state-backed cyberespionage group.

Silk Typhoon is believed to have exploited two zero-day bugs (CVE-2024-12356 and CVE-2024-12686) to breach BeyondTrust's systems and later used a stolen API key to compromise 17 Remote Support SaaS instances, including the Treasury's instance.

The Chinese hacking group has also targeted the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), which administers U.S. sanctions programs, and the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which reviews foreign investments for national security risks.

[6] BleepingComputer - Google patches first Chrome zero-day exploited in attacks this year
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Mon, 16 Feb 2026 03:19:19 -0500

[TAM METİN - 451 kelime]
Google has released emergency updates to fix a high-severity Chrome vulnerability exploited in zero-day attacks, marking the first such security flaw patched since the start of the year.

"Google is aware that an exploit for CVE-2026-2441 exists in the wild," Google said in a security advisory issued on Friday.

According to the Chromium commit history, this use-after-free vulnerability (reported by security researcher Shaheen Fazim) is due to an iterator invalidation bug in CSSFontFeatureValuesMap, Chrome's implementation of CSS font feature values. Successful exploitation can allow attackers to trigger browser crashes, rendering issues, data corruption, or other undefined behavior.

The commit message also notes that the CVE-2026-2441 patch addresses "the immediate problem" but indicates there's "remaining work" tracked in bug 483936078, suggesting this might be a temporary fix or that related issues still need to be addressed.

The patch was tagged as "cherry-picked" (or backported) across multiple commits, indicating that it was important enough to include in a stable release rather than waiting for the next major version (likely because the vulnerability is being exploited in the wild).

Although Google found evidence of attackers exploiting this zero-day flaw in the wild, it did not share additional details regarding these incidents.

"Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven't yet fixed," it noted.

Google has now fixed this vulnerability for users in the Stable Desktop channel, with new versions rolling out to Windows, macOS (145.0.7632.75/76), and Linux users (144.0.7559.75) worldwide over the coming days or weeks.

If you don't want to update manually, you can also let Chrome check for updates automatically and install them after the next launch.

While this is the first actively exploited Chrome security vulnerability patched since the start of 2026, last year Google addressed a total of eight zero-days abused in the wild, many of them reported by the company's Threat Analysis Group (TAG), widely known for tracking and identifying zero-days exploited in spyware attacks targeting high-risk individuals.

[7] Krebs on Security - Kimwolf Botnet Swamps Anonymity Network I2P
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Wed, 11 Feb 2026 16:08:11 +0000
Link: https://krebsonsecurity.com/2026/02/kimwolf-botnet-swamps-anonymity-network-i2p/

[TAM METİN - 831 kelime]
For the past week, the massive “Internet of Things” (IoT) botnet known as Kimwolf has been disrupting The Invisible Internet Project (I2P), a decentralized, encrypted communications network designed to anonymize and secure online communications. I2P users started reporting disruptions in the network around the same time the Kimwolf botmasters began relying on it to evade takedown attempts against the botnet’s control servers.

Kimwolf is a botnet that surfaced in late 2025 and quickly infected millions of systems, turning poorly secured IoT devices like TV streaming boxes, digital picture frames and routers into relays for malicious traffic and abnormally large distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.

I2P is a decentralized, privacy-focused network that allows people to communicate and share information anonymously.

“It works by routing data through multiple encrypted layers across volunteer-operated nodes, hiding both the sender’s and receiver’s locations,” the I2P website explains. “The result is a secure, censorship-resistant network designed for private websites, messaging, and data sharing.”

On February 3, I2P users began complaining on the organization’s GitHub page about tens of thousands of routers suddenly overwhelming the network, preventing existing users from communicating with legitimate nodes. Users reported a rapidly increasing number of new routers joining the network that were unable to transmit data, and that the mass influx of new systems had overwhelmed the network to the point where users could no longer connect.

I2P users complaining about service disruptions from a rapidly increasing number of routers suddenly swamping the network.

When one I2P user asked whether the network was under attack, another user replied, “Looks like it. My physical router freezes when the number of connections exceeds 60,000.”

A graph shared by I2P developers showing a marked drop in successful connections on the I2P network around the time the Kimwolf botnet started trying to use the network for fallback communications.

The same day that I2P users began noticing the outages, the individuals in control of Kimwolf posted to their Discord channel that they had accidentally disrupted I2P after attempting to join 700,000 Kimwolf-infected bots as nodes on the network.

The Kimwolf botmaster openly discusses what they are doing with the botnet in a Discord channel with my name on it.

Although Kimwolf is known as a potent weapon for launching DDoS attacks, the outages caused this week by some portion of the botnet attempting to join I2P are what’s known as a “Sybil attack,” a threat in peer-to-peer networks where a single entity can disrupt the system by creating, controlling, and operating a large number of fake, pseudonymous identities.

Indeed, the number of Kimwolf-infected routers that tried to join I2P this past week was many times the network’s normal size. I2P’s Wikipedia page says the network consists of roughly 55,000 computers distributed throughout the world, with each participant acting as both a router (to relay traffic) and a client.

However, Lance James, founder of the New York City based cybersecurity consultancy Unit 221B and the original founder of I2P, told KrebsOnSecurity the entire I2P network now consists of between 15,000 and 20,000 devices on any given day.

An I2P user posted this graph on Feb. 10, showing tens of thousands of routers — mostly from the United States — suddenly attempting to join the network.

Benjamin Brundage is founder of Synthient, a startup that tracks proxy services and was the first to document Kimwolf’s unique spreading techniques. Brundage said the Kimwolf operator(s) have been trying to build a command and control network that can’t easily be taken down by security companies and network operators that are working together to combat the spread of the botnet.

Brundage said the people in control of Kimwolf have been experimenting with using I2P and a similar anonymity network — Tor — as a backup command and control network, although there have been no reports of widespread disruptions in the Tor network recently.

“I don’t think their goal is to take I2P down,” he said. “It’s more they’re looking for an alternative to keep the botnet stable in the face of takedown attempts.”

The Kimwolf botnet created challenges for Cloudflare late last year when it began instructing millions of infected devices to use Cloudflare’s domain name system (DNS) settings, causing control domains associated with Kimwolf to repeatedly usurp Amazon, Apple, Google and Microsoft in Cloudflare’s public ranking of the most frequently requested websites.

James said the I2P network is still operating at about half of its normal capacity, and that a new release is rolling out which should bring some stability improvements over the next week for users.

Meanwhile, Brundage said the good news is Kimwolf’s overlords appear to have quite recently alienated some of their more competent developers and operators, leading to a rookie mistake this past week that caused the botnet’s overall numbers to drop by more than 600,000 infected systems.

“It seems like they’re just testing stuff, like running experiments in production,” he said. “But the botnet’s numbers are dropping significantly now, and they don’t seem to know what they’re doing.”

Microsoft today released updates to fix more than 50 security holes in its Windows operating systems and other software, including patches for a whopping six “zero-day” vulnerabilities that attackers are already exploiting in the wild.

Zero-day #1 this month is CVE-2026-21510, a security feature bypass vulnerability in Windows Shell wherein a single click on a malicious link can quietly bypass Windows protections and run attacker-controlled content without warning or consent dialogs. CVE-2026-21510 affects all currently supported versions of Windows.

The zero-day flaw CVE-2026-21513 is a security bypass bug targeting MSHTML, the proprietary engine of the default Web browser in Windows. CVE-2026-21514 is a related security feature bypass in Microsoft Word.

The zero-day CVE-2026-21533 allows local attackers to elevate their user privileges to “SYSTEM” level access in Windows Remote Desktop Services. CVE-2026-21519 is a zero-day elevation of privilege flaw in the Desktop Window Manager (DWM), a key component of Windows that organizes windows on a user’s screen. Microsoft fixed a different zero-day in DWM just last month.

The sixth zero-day is CVE-2026-21525, a potentially disruptive denial-of-service vulnerability in the Windows Remote Access Connection Manager, the service responsible for maintaining VPN connections to corporate networks.

Chris Goettl at Ivanti reminds us Microsoft has issued several out-of-band security updates since January’s Patch Tuesday. On January 17, Microsoft pushed a fix that resolved a credential prompt failure when attempting remote desktop or remote application connections. On January 26, Microsoft patched a zero-day security feature bypass vulnerability (CVE-2026-21509) in Microsoft Office.

Kev Breen at Immersive notes that this month’s Patch Tuesday includes several fixes for remote code execution vulnerabilities affecting GitHub Copilot and multiple integrated development environments (IDEs), including VS Code, Visual Studio, and JetBrains products. The relevant CVEs are CVE-2026-21516, CVE-2026-21523, and CVE-2026-21256.

Breen said the AI vulnerabilities Microsoft patched this month stem from a command injection flaw that can be triggered through prompt injection, or tricking the AI agent into doing something it shouldn’t — like executing malicious code or commands.

“Developers are high-value targets for threat actors, as they often have access to sensitive data such as API keys and secrets that function as keys to critical infrastructure, including privileged AWS or Azure API keys,” Breen said. “When organizations enable developers and automation pipelines to use LLMs and agentic AI, a malicious prompt can have significant impact. This does not mean organizations should stop using AI. It does mean developers should understand the risks, teams should clearly identify which systems and workflows have access to AI agents, and least-privilege principles should be applied to limit the blast radius if developer secrets are compromised.”

The SANS Internet Storm Center has a clickable breakdown of each individual fix this month from Microsoft, indexed by severity and CVSS score. Enterprise Windows admins involved in testing patches before rolling them out should keep an eye on askwoody.com, which often has the skinny on wonky updates. Please don’t neglect to back up your data if it has been a while since you’ve done that, and feel free to sound off in the comments if you experience problems installing any of these fixes.

[9] Krebs on Security - Please Don’t Feed the Scattered Lapsus ShinyHunters

A prolific data ransom gang that calls itself Scattered Lapsus ShinyHunters (SLSH) has a distinctive playbook when it seeks to extort payment from victim firms: Harassing, threatening and even swatting executives and their families, all while notifying journalists and regulators about the extent of the intrusion. Some victims reportedly are paying — perhaps as much to contain the stolen data as to stop the escalating personal attacks. But a top SLSH expert warns that engaging at all beyond a “We’re not paying” response only encourages further harassment, noting that the group’s fractious and unreliable history means the only winning move is not to pay.

Unlike traditional, highly regimented Russia-based ransomware affiliate groups, SLSH is an unruly and somewhat fluid English-language extortion gang that appears uninterested in building a reputation of consistent behavior whereby victims might have some measure of confidence that the criminals will keep their word if paid.

That’s according to Allison Nixon, director of research at the New York City based security consultancy Unit 221B. Nixon has been closely tracking the criminal group and individual members as they bounce between various Telegram channels used to extort and harass victims, and she said SLSH differs from traditional data ransom groups in other important ways that argue against trusting them to do anything they say they’ll do — such as destroying stolen data.

Like SLSH, many traditional Russian ransomware groups have employed high-pressure tactics to force payment in exchange for a decryption key and/or a promise to delete stolen data, such as publishing a dark web shaming blog with samples of stolen data next to a countdown clock, or notifying journalists and board members of the victim company. But Nixon said the extortion from SLSH quickly escalates way beyond that — to threats of physical violence against executives and their families, DDoS attacks on the victim’s website, and repeated email-flooding campaigns.

SLSH is known for breaking into companies by phishing employees over the phone, and using the purloined access to steal sensitive internal data. In a January 30 blog post, Google’s security forensics firm Mandiant said SLSH’s most recent extortion attacks stem from incidents spanning early to mid-January 2026, when SLSH members pretended to be IT staff and called employees at targeted victim organizations claiming that the company was updating MFA settings.

“The threat actor directed the employees to victim-branded credential harvesting sites to capture their SSO credentials and MFA codes, and then registered their own device for MFA,” the blog post explained.

Victims often first learn of the breach when their brand name is uttered on whatever ephemeral new public Telegram group chat SLSH is using to threaten, extort and harass their prey. According to Nixon, the coordinated harassment on the SLSH Telegram channels is part of a well-orchestrated strategy to overwhelm the victim organization by manufacturing humiliation that pushes them over the threshold to pay.

Nixon said multiple executives at targeted organizations have been subject to “swatting” attacks, wherein SLSH communicated a phony bomb threat or hostage situation at the target’s address in the hopes of eliciting a heavily armed police response at their home or place of work.

“A big part of what they’re doing to victims is the psychological aspect of it, like harassing executives’ kids and threatening the board of the company,” Nixon told KrebsOnSecurity. “And while these victims are getting extortion demands, they’re simultaneously getting outreach from media outlets saying, ‘Hey, do you have any comments on the bad things we’re going to write about you.”

In a blog post today, Unit 221B argues that no one should negotiate with SLSH because the group has demonstrated a willingness to extort victims based on promises that it has no intention to keep. Nixon points out that all of SLSH’s known members hail from The Com, shorthand for a constellation of cybercrime-focused Discord and Telegram communities which serve as a kind of distributed social network that facilitates instant collaboration.

Nixon said Com-based extortion groups tend to instigate feuds and drama between group members, leading to lying, betrayals, credibility destroying behavior, backstabbing, and sabotaging each other.

“With this type of ongoing dysfunction, often compounding by substance abuse, these threat actors often aren’t able to act with the core goal in mind of completing a successful, strategic ransom operation,” Nixon wrote. “They continually lose control with outbursts that put their strategy and operational security at risk, which severely limits their ability to build a professional, scalable, and sophisticated criminal organization network for continued successful ransoms – unlike other, more tenured and professional criminal organizations focused on ransomware alone.”

Intrusions from established ransomware groups typically center around encryption/decryption malware that mostly stays on the affected machine. In contrast, Nixon said, ransom from a Com group is often structured the same as violent sextortion schemes against minors, wherein members of The Com will steal damaging information, threaten to release it, and “promise” to delete it if the victim complies without any guarantee or technical proof point that they will keep their word. She writes:

A key component of SLSH’s efforts to convince victims to pay, Nixon said, involves manipulating the media into hyping the threat posed by this group. This approach also borrows a page from the playbook of sextortion attacks, she said, which encourages predators to keep targets continuously engaged and worrying about the consequences of non-compliance.

“On days where SLSH had no substantial criminal ‘win’ to announce, they focused on announcing death threats and harassment to keep law enforcement, journalists, and cybercrime industry professionals focused on this group,” she said.

Nixon knows a thing or two about being threatened by SLSH: For the past several months, the group’s Telegram channels have been replete with threats of physical violence against her, against Yours Truly, and against other security researchers. These threats, she said, are just another way the group seeks to generate media attention and achieve a veneer of credibility, but they are useful as indicators of compromise because SLSH members tend to name drop and malign security researchers even in their communications with victims.

“Watch for the following behaviors in their communications to you or their public statements,” Unit 221B’s advisory reads. “Repeated abusive mentions of Allison Nixon (or “A.N”), Unit 221B, or cybersecurity journalists—especially Brian Krebs—or any other cybersecurity employee, or cybersecurity company. Any threats to kill, or commit terrorism, or violence against internal employees, cybersecurity employees, investigators, and journalists.”

Unit 221B says that while the pressure campaign during an extortion attempt may be traumatizing to employees, executives, and their family members, entering into drawn-out negotiations with SLSH incentivizes the group to increase the level of harm and risk, which could include the physical safety of employees and their families.

“The breached data will never go back to the way it was, but we can assure you that the harassment will end,” Nixon said. “So, your decision to pay should be a separate issue from the harassment. We believe that when you separate these issues, you will objectively see that the best course of action to protect your interests, in both the short and long term, is to refuse payment.”

[10] Threatpost - Student Loan Breach Exposes 2.5M Records
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Wed, 31 Aug 2022 12:57:48 +0000

[TAM METİN - 511 kelime]
2.5 million people were affected, in a breach that could spell more trouble down the line.

EdFinancial and the Oklahoma Student Loan Authority (OSLA) are notifying over 2.5 million loanees that their personal data was exposed in a data breach.

The target of the breach was Nelnet Servicing, the Lincoln, Neb.-based servicing system and web portal provider for OSLA and EdFinancial, according to a breach disclosure letter.

Nelnet revealed the breach to affected loan recipients on July 21, 2022 via a letter.

“[Our] cybersecurity team took immediate action to secure the information system, block the suspicious activity, fix the issue, and launched[sic] an investigation with third-party forensic experts to determine the nature and scope of the activity,” according to the letter.

By August 17th, the investigation determined that personal user information was accessed by an unauthorized party. That exposed information included names, home addresses, email addresses, phone numbers and social security numbers for a total of 2,501,324 student loan account holders. Users’ financial information was not exposed.

According to a breach disclosure filing submitted by Nelnet’s general counsel, Bill Munn, to the state of Maine the breach occurred sometime between June 1, 2022 and July 22, 2022. However, a letter to affected customers pinpoints the breach to July 21. The breach was discovered on August 17, 2022.

“On July 21, 2022, Nelnet Servicing, LLC (Nelnet), our servicing system and customer website

portal provider, notified us that they had discovered a vulnerability that we believe led to this incident,” according to the Nelnet.

It’s unclear what the vulnerability was.

“On August 17, 2022, this investigation determined that certain student loan account registration information was accessible by an unknown party beginning in June 2022 and ending on July 22, 2022,” according to the letter.

Loan Recipient Targets

Although users’ most sensitive financial data was protected, the personal information that was accessed in the Nelnet breach “has potential to be leveraged in future social engineering and phishing campaigns,” explained Melissa Bischoping, endpoint security research specialist at Tanium, in a statement via email.

“With recent news of student loan forgiveness, it’s reasonable to expect the occasion to be used by scammers as a gateway for criminal activity,” Bischoping said.

Last week, the Biden administration announced a plan to cancel $10,000 of student loan debt for low- and middle-income loanees. She said the loan forgiveness program will be used to lure victims into opening up phishing emails.

She warns that recently breached data will be used to impersonate affected brands in waves of phishing campaigns targeting students and recent college graduates.

“Because they can leverage the trust from existing business relationships they can be particularly deceptive,” she wrote.

According to the breach disclosure Nelnet Servicing informed Edfinancial and OSLA that Nelnet Servicing’s cybersecurity team “took immediate action to secure the information system, block the suspicious activity, fix the issue, and launched an investigation with third-party forensic experts to determine the nature and scope of the activity.”

Remediation also included two years of free credit monitoring, credit reports and up to $1 million in identity theft insurance.

[11] Threatpost - Watering Hole Attacks Push ScanBox Keylogger
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Tue, 30 Aug 2022 16:00:43 +0000
Link: https://threatpost.com/watering-hole-attacks-push-scanbox-keylogger/180490/

[TAM METİN - 918 kelime]
Researchers uncover a watering hole attack likely carried out by APT TA423, which attempts to plant the ScanBox JavaScript-based reconnaissance tool.

A China-based threat actor has ramped up efforts to distribute the ScanBox reconnaissance framework to victims that include domestic Australian organizations and offshore energy firms in the South China Sea. The bait used by the advanced threat group (APT) is targeted messages that supposedly link back to Australian news websites.

The cyber-espionage campaigns are believed to have launched April 2022 through mid-June 2022, according to a Tuesday report by Proofpoint’s Threat Research Team and PwC’s Threat Intelligence team.

The threat actor, according to researchers, is believed to be the China-based APT TA423, also known as Red Ladon. “Proofpoint assesses with moderate confidence that this activity may be attributable to the threat actor TA423 / Red Ladon, which multiple reports assess to operate out of Hainan Island, China,” according to the report.

The APT is most recently known for a recent indictment. “A 2021 indictment by the US Department of Justice assessed that TA423 / Red Ladon provides long-running support to the Hainan Province Ministry of State Security (MSS),” researchers said.

MSS is the civilian intelligence, security and cyber police agency for the People’s Republic of China. It is believed responsible for counter-intelligence, foreign intelligence, political security and tied to industrial and cyber espionage efforts by China.

Dusting Off the ScanBox

The campaign leverages the ScanBox framework. ScanBox is a customizable and multifunctional Javascript-based framework used by adversaries to conducting covert reconnaissance.

ScanBox has been used by adversaries for nearly a decade and is noteworthy because criminals can use the tool to conduct counter intelligence without having to plant malware on a targets system.

“ScanBox is particularly dangerous as it doesn’t require malware to be successfully deployed to disk in order to steal information – the keylogging functionality simply requires the JavaScript code to be executed by a web browser,” according to PwC researchers referring to a previous campaign.

In lieu of malware, attackers can use ScanBox in conjunction with watering hole attacks. Adversaries load the malicious JavaScript onto a compromised website where the ScanBox acts as a keylogger snagging all of a user’s typed activity on the infected watering hole website.

TA423’s attacks began with phishing emails, with such titles as “Sick Leave,” “User Research” and “Request Cooperation.” Often, the emails purported to come from an employee of the “Australian Morning News,” a fictional organization. The employee implored targets to visit their “humble news website,” australianmorningnews[.]com.

“Upon clicking the link and redirecting to the site, visitors were served the ScanBox framework,” researchers wrote.

The link directed targets to a web page with content copied from actual news sites, like the BBC and Sky News. In the process, it also delivered the ScanBox malware framework.

ScanBox keylogger data culled from waterholes is part of a multi-stage attack, giving attackers insight into the potential targets that will help them launch future attacks against them. This technique is often called browser fingerprinting.

The primary, initial script sources a list of information about the target computer, including the operating system, language and version of Adobe Flash installed. ScanBox additionally runs a check for browser extensions, plugins and components such WebRTC.

“The module implements WebRTC, a free and open-source technology supported on all major browsers, which allows web browsers and mobile applications to perform real-time communication (RTC) over application programming interfaces (APIs). This allows ScanBox to connect to a set of pre-configured targets,” researchers explain.

Adversaries can then leverage a technology called STUN (Session Traversal Utilities for NAT). This is a standardized set of methods, including a network protocol, that allows interactive communications (including real-time voice, video, and messaging applications) to traverse network address translator (NAT) gateways, researchers explain.

“STUN is supported by the WebRTC protocol. Through a third-party STUN server located on the Internet, it allows hosts to discover the presence of a NAT, and to discover the mapped IP address and port number that the NAT has allocated for the application’s User Datagram Protocol (UDP) flows to remote hosts. ScanBox implements NAT traversal using STUN servers as part of Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE), a peer-to-peer communication method used for clients to communicate as directly as possible, avoiding having to communicate through NATs, firewalls, or other solutions,” according to researchers.

“This means that the ScanBox module can set up ICE communications to STUN servers, and communicate with victim machines even if they are behind NAT,” they explain.

The threat actors “support the Chinese government in matters related to the South China Sea, including during the recent tensions in Taiwan,” Sherrod DeGrippo, vice president of threat research and detection at Proofpoint, explained in a statement, “This group specifically wants to know who is active in the region and, while we can’t say for certain, their focus on naval issues is likely to remain a constant priority in places like Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, and Australia.”

The group has, in the past, expanded well beyond Australasia. According to a Department of Justice indictment from July, 2021, the group has “stolen trade secrets and confidential business information” from victims in “the United States, Austria, Cambodia, Canada, Germany, Indonesia, Malaysia, Norway, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Targeted industries included, among others, aviation, defense, education, government, health care, biopharmaceutical and maritime.”

Despite the DoJ indictment, analysts “have not observed a distinct disruption of operational tempo” from TA423, and they “collectively expect TA423 / Red Ladon to continue pursuing its intelligence-gathering and espionage mission.”

[12] Threatpost - Tentacles of ‘0ktapus’ Threat Group Victimize 130 Firms
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Mon, 29 Aug 2022 14:56:19 +0000

[TAM METİN - 614 kelime]
Over 130 companies tangled in sprawling phishing campaign that spoofed a multi-factor authentication system.

Targeted attacks on Twilio and Cloudflare employees are tied to a massive phishing campaign that resulted in 9,931 accounts at over 130 organizations being compromised. The campaigns are tied to focused abuse of identity and access management firm Okta, which gained the threat actors the 0ktapus moniker, by researchers.

“The primary goal of the threat actors was to obtain Okta identity credentials and multi-factor authentication (MFA) codes from users of the targeted organizations,” wrote Group-IB researchers in a recent report. “These users received text messages containing links to phishing sites that mimicked the Okta authentication page of their organization.”

Impacted were 114 US-based firms, with additional victims of sprinkled across 68 additional countries.

Roberto Martinez, senior threat intelligence analyst at Group-IB, said the scope of the attacks is still an unknown. “The 0ktapus campaign has been incredibly successful, and the full scale of it may not be known for some time,” he said.

What the 0ktapus Hackers Wanted

The 0ktapus attackers are believed to have begun their campaign by targeting telecommunications companies in hopes of winning access to potential targets’ phone numbers.

While unsure exactly how threat actors obtained a list of phone numbers used in MFA-related attacks, one theory researchers posit is that 0ktapus attackers began their campaign targeting telecommunications companies.

“[A]ccording to the compromised data analyzed by Group-IB, the threat actors started their attacks by targeting mobile operators and telecommunications companies and could have collected the numbers from those initial attacks,” researchers wrote.

Next, attackers sent phishing links to targets via text messages. Those links led to webpages mimicking the Okta authentication page used by the target’s employer. Victims were then asked to submit Okta identity credentials in addition to a multi-factor authentication (MFA) codes employees used to secure their logins.

In an accompanying technical blog, researchers at Group-IB explain that the initial compromises of mostly software-as-a-service firms were a phase-one in a multi-pronged attack. 0ktapus’ ultimate goal was to access company mailing lists or customer-facing systems in hopes of facilitating supply-chain attacks.

In a possible related incident, within hours of Group-IB publishing its report late last week, the firm DoorDash revealed it was targeted in an attack with all the hallmarks of an 0ktapus-style attack.

Blast Radius: MFA Attacks

In a blog post DoorDash revealed; “unauthorized party used the stolen credentials of vendor employees to gain access to some of our internal tools.” The attackers, according to the post, went on to steal personal information – including names, phone numbers, email and delivery addresses – from customers and delivery people.

In the course of its campaign, the attacker compromised 5,441 MFA codes, Group-IB reported.

“Security measures such as MFA can appear secure… but it is clear that attackers can overcome them with relatively simple tools,” researchers wrote.

“This is yet another phishing attack showing how easy it is for adversaries to bypass supposedly secure multifactor authentication,” Roger Grimes, data-driven defense evangelist at KnowBe4, wrote in a statement via email. “It simply does no good to move users from easily phish-able passwords to easily phish-able MFA. It’s a lot of hard work, resources, time, and money, not to get any benefit.”

To mitigate 0ktapus-style campaigns, the researchers recommended good hygiene around URLs and passwords, and using FIDO2-compliant security keys for MFA.

“Whatever MFA someone uses,” Grimes advised, “the user should be taught about the common types of attacks that are committed against their form of MFA, how to recognize those attacks, and how to respond. We do the same when we tell users to pick passwords but don’t when we tell them to use supposedly more secure MFA.”

Data extortion group ShinyHunters has published over 600,000 Canada Goose customer records on its data leak site. Canada Goose is a Canadian luxury outerwear company best known for high‑end, cold‑weather jackets and parkas. Founded in 1957 and headquartered in Toronto, it has grown into a global fashion brand selling premium apparel through its own stores and wholesale partners worldwide.

The company, however, states that it did not suffer a security breach.

Canada Goose told BleepingComputer that the leaked data seems tied to past customer transactions.

“At this time, we have no indication of any breach of our own systems. We are currently reviewing the newly released dataset to assess its accuracy and scope and will take any further steps as may be appropriate.” the firm told BleepingComputer. “To be clear, our review shows no evidence that unmasked financial data was involved. Canada Goose remains committed to protecting customer information.”

ShinyHunters announced on its Tor data leak site the leak of 1.67 GB of data allegedly stolen from Canada Goose, including over 600K customer records. Leaked data includes order info, including names, emails, addresses, partial card data, device/browser info, and purchase history. BleepingComputer confirmed the leaked data includes partial card details, such as card brand, last four digits, some BIN numbers, and payment authorization metadata.

The company is investigating the claims to determine the number of customers that may be affected and notify them.

Recently, the cybercrime group ShinyHunters claimed responsibility for the Figure breach on its dark web site, saying Figure refused to pay a ransom and releasing about 2.5GB of stolen data.

Blockchain-based lending firm Figure confirmed a data breach after an employee fell victim to a social engineering attack. According to a company spokesperson, the incident allowed hackers to access and steal a limited number of files. The company disclosed the breach following inquiries and is assessing the impact.

Figure Technology Solutions, Inc. is a US financial technology company. Established in 2018, it develops and operates blockchain-based platforms used in lending, capital markets, and asset management.

The company offers consumer and institutional lending products such as HELOCs, cash-out refinancing, DSCR loans, crypto-backed loans, and operates the Figure Connect credit marketplace.

[14] Security Affairs - Microsoft alerts on DNS-based ClickFix variant delivering malware via nslookup

[TAM METİN - 422 kelime]
Microsoft has revealed a new ClickFix variant that deceives users into running a malicious nslookup command through the Windows Run dialog to retrieve a second-stage payload via DNS. ClickFix typically uses fake CAPTCHA or error messages to trick victims into infecting their own systems, helping attackers evade security defenses. The technique has evolved into multiple variants over the past two years.

“Microsoft Defender researchers observed attackers using yet another evasion approach to the ClickFix technique: Asking targets to run a command that executes a custom DNS lookup and parses the `Name:` response to receive the next-stage payload for execution.” Microsoft wrote on X.

In the latest ClickFix variant, attackers use cmd.exe to perform a DNS lookup against a hard-coded external server. The Name: response is extracted and executed as the second-stage payload. This DNS-based approach lets attackers signal and deliver payloads via their own infrastructure, reducing reliance on web requests and helping the malicious activity blend into normal network traffic.

The output is filtered to extract the `Name:` DNS response, which is executed as… pic.twitter.com/QXf06cWOCx

Microsoft warns that this new ClickFix variant uses DNS as a “lightweight staging or signaling channel,” allowing attackers to reach their own infrastructure and add a validation step before running the second-stage payload. This method reduces reliance on web requests and helps hide malicious activity in normal network traffic. The payload downloads a ZIP from an external server, extracts a Python script to conduct reconnaissance, and drops a VBScript that launches ModeloRAT, a Python-based RAT.

Attackers achieve persistence by creating a Windows shortcut in the Startup folder, ensuring the malware runs at every system startup.

“Upon execution of the second-stage payload provided by the DNS response, the attack proceeds through an attack chain leading to downloading hxxp://azwsappdev[.]com/wdhmgpmihudkueq[.]zip and extracting a portable Python bundle and malicious python code, then running a malicious Python script for host/domain reconnaissance, performing a series of discovery commands, before dropping the final payload `%APPDATA%\WPy64-31401\python\script.vbs` and `%STARTUP%/MonitoringService.lnk`pointing to the VBScript for persistence. This final payload is a remote access trojan and called ModeloRAT.” conlcudes the report.

[TAM METİN - 243 kelime]
Google has released urgent security updates to address a high-severity zero-day vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2026-2441, in Chrome that is already being exploited in real-world attacks. The flaw is a use-after-free bug in the browser’s CSS component.

This is the first actively exploited Chrome zero-day fixed in 2026, after eight similar flaws were patched in 2025.

“Use after free in CSS in Google Chrome prior to 145.0.7632.75 allowed a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code inside a sandbox via a crafted HTML page.” reads the description of the vulnerability provided by NIST’s National Vulnerability Database (NVD).

An attacker could exploit the flaw to compromise affected systems. The issue was discovered and responsibly reported by security researcher Shaheen Fazim on February 11, 2026.

“CVE-2026-2441: Use after free in CSS. Reported by Shaheen Fazim on 2026-02-11.” reads the Google’s advisory. “Google is aware that an exploit for CVE-2026-2441 exists in the wild.”

Google has confirmed that an exploit for CVE-2026-2441 exists in the wild, but has not shared details about how it is being used or which threat actor is behind the exploitation of the flaw.

Users of Chromium-based browsers such as Microsoft Edge, Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi should also install updates once available. Chrome’s Stable channel has been updated to versions 145.0.7632.75/76 for Windows and Mac, and 144.0.7559.75 for Linux, with the rollout happening over the coming days and weeks.

[17] Graham Cluley - Polish hacker charged seven years after massive Morele.net data breach

[TAM METİN - 409 kelime]
A 29-year-old Polish man has been charged in connection with a data breach that exposed the personal details of around 2.5 million customers of the popular Polish e-commerce website Morele.net.

Poland's Central Cybercrime Bureau (CBZC) announced that charges were filed on 30 January 2026, following years of investigation into the 2018 breach of Morele.net, that specialises in electronics, computer equipment and home appliances.

The high-profile breach of Morele.net, whose international equivalents include the likes of Best Buy, Newegg, and Amazon, sent shockwaves through Poland's online retail sector.

The investigation into the data breach had originally been shelved after police failed to identify a suspect, but authorities claim that the trail never went entirely cold.

Over time investigators identified the attack vector, reconstructed the sequence of events, and traced digital breadcrumbs back to the alleged hacker - demonstrating their determination in a YouTube video.

According to a CBZC press release, the suspect has admitted responsibility for the hack.

The cyber attack exposed names, email addresses, phone numbers, home addresses, and md5crypt-hashed passwords. Although payment card details were not compromised in the breach, it was reported that some 35,000 customers did have particularly sensitive information stolen, including national ID numbers, financial details, education information, income, and marital status.

Morele.net refused to pay a ransom, and the breached database was published online.

Unfortunately for the site's users who had their information breached, fraudsters weaponised the stolen data immediately. Victims reported receiving SMS messages demanding payment of 1 Polish zloty to "complete" their orders, accompanied by phishing links that stole banking credentials.

In 2019, in what was one of the country's largest GDPR-related fines at the time, Poland's data protection authority regulator hit Morele.net to the tune of €645,000, claiming that had failed to detect and respond to unusual network traffic.

Morele.net contested the fine, arguing that its security measures were reasonable even if they ultimately proved insufficient against a determined attacker, and eventually Poland's Supreme Administrative Court annulled the penalty, saying it had finding deficiencies in the regulator's justification and calculation of the fine.

Now, however, it is the alleged hacker who will be hoping he can escape receiving a heavy punishment.

If anything, this case serves as a timely reminder to cybercriminals that they should not assume that they have evaded justice just because years have passed since their offence. Digital forensics techniques continue to improve, and law enforcement agencies are increasingly willing to pursue cold cases when new leads emerge.

AI bots are having existential crises, inventing religions, and allegedly plotting against humanity… or so the internet would have you believe.

We dig into Moltbook, the “AI-only” social network that sent Twitter into a meltdown, attracted breathless talk of the singularity, and turned out to be far less Terminator and far more humans role-playing as bots.

Plus we discuss why “vibe coding” your app might be a catastrophically bad idea, when security researchers can easily peek inside rifle through your private messages, API keys, and databases.

Also this week we learn that pro-Russian hackers are circling the Winter Olympics – or is it the Jamaican Bobsleigh team?

All this and more is discussed in episode 454 of the “Smashing Security” podcast with cybersecurity veteran Graham Cluley, and special guest Iain Thomson.

[19] SANS ISC - 2026 64-Bits Malware Trend, (Mon, Feb 16th)

2026 64-Bits Malware Trend

In 2022 (time flies!), I wrote a diary about the 32-bits VS. 64-bits malware landscape[1]. It demonstrated that, despite the growing number of 64-bits computers, the "old-architecture" remained the standard. In the SANS malware reversing training (FOR610[2]), we quickly cover the main differences between the two architectures. One of the conclusions is that 32-bits code is still popular because it acts like a comme denominator and allows threat actors to target more Windows computers. Yes, Microsoft Windows can smoothly execute 32-bits code on 64-bits computers. It is still the case in 2026? Did the situation evolved?

Last week, I make the exact same exercise and generated some statistics. I download the malware archive from Malware Bazaar[3] and re-executed my YARA rule.

2.167 ZIP archives (one per day)

1.120.034.288.112 bytes  (1.1TB)

Time line covered: from 2020/02/24 - 2026/02/05

346.985 samples analyzed (only PE files)

312.307 32-bits samples

34.677 64-bits samples

11% of 64-bits samples

First, an overview of the global malware trend over the complete time period:

Zoom on the last year:

Now the interesting graph: the 64-bits sample trend over the complete period:

Zoom on the last year:

We can clearly see that, compared to 2022, there is now a trend in 64-bits code! Have a look at the last 30 days:

We are getting close to a 50-50 repartition!

AI-Powered Knowledge Graph Generator & APTs

Unstructured text to interactive knowledge graph via LLM & SPO triplet extraction

Courtesy of TLDR InfoSec Launches & Tools again, another fine discovery in Robert McDermott’s AI Powered Knowledge Graph Generator. Robert’s system takes unstructured text, uses your preferred LLM and extracts knowledge in the form of Subject-Predicate-Object (SPO) triplets, then visualizes the relationships as an interactive knowledge graph.[1]

Robert has documented AI Powered Knowledge Graph Generator (AIKG) beautifully, I’ll not be regurgitating it needlessly, so please read further for details regarding features, requirements, configuration, and options. I will detail a few installation insights that got me up and running quickly.
The feature summary is this:
AIKG automatically splits large documents into manageable chunks for processing and uses AI to identify entities and their relationships. As AIKG ensures consistent entity naming across document chunks, it discovers additional relationships between disconnected parts of the graph, then creates an interactive graph visualization. AIKG works with any OpenAI-compatible API endpoint; I used Ollama exclusively here with Google’s Gemma 3, a lightweight family of models built on Gemini technology. Gemma 3 is multimodal, processing text and images, and is the current, most capable model that runs on a single GPU. I ran my experimemts on a Lenovo ThinkBook 14 G4 circa 2022 with an AMD Ryzen 7 5825U 8-core processor, Radeon Graphics, and 40gb memory running Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS.
My installation guidelines assume you have a full instance of Python3 and Ollama installed. My installation was implemented under my tools directory.

I opted to test AIKG via a couple of articles specific to Russian state-sponsored adversarial cyber campaigns as input:

CISA’s Cybersecurity Advisory Russian GRU Targeting Western Logistics Entities and Technology Companies May 2025

SecurityWeek’s Russia’s APT28 Targeting Energy Research, Defense Collaboration Entities January 2026

My use of these articles in particular was based on the assertion that APT and nation state activity is often well represented via interactive knowledge graph. I’ve advocated endlessly for visual link analysis and graph tech, including Maltego (the OG of knowledge graph tools) at far back as 2009, Graphviz in 2015, GraphFrames in 2018 and Beagle in 2019. As always, visualization, coupled with entity relationship mappings, are an imperative for security analysts, threat hunters, and any security professional seeking deeper and more meaningful insights. While the SecurityWeek piece is a bit light on content and density, it served well as a good initial experiment.
The CISA advisory is much more dense and served as an excellent, more extensive experiment.
I pulled them both into individual text files more easily ingested for processing with AIKG, shared for you here if you’d like to play along at home.

Starting with SecurityWeek’s Russia’s APT28 Targeting Energy Research, Defense Collaboration Entities, and the subsequent Russia-APT28-targeting.txt file I created for model ingestion, I ran Gemma 3 as a 12 billion parameter model as follows:

You may want or need to run Gemma 3 with fewer parameters depending on the performance and capabilities of your local system. Note that I am calling file paths rather explicitly to overcome complaints about missing config and input files.
The article makes reference to APT credential harvesting activity targeting people associated with a Turkish energy and nuclear research agency, as well as a spoofed OWA login portal containing Turkish-language text to target Turkish scientists and researchers. As part of it’s use of semantic triples (Subject-Predicate-Object (SPO) triplets), how does AIKG perform linking entities, attributes and values into machine readable statements [2] derived from the article content, as seen in Figure 1?

Figure 1: AIKG Gemma 3:12b result from SecurityWeek article

Quite well, I’d say. To manipulate the graph, you may opt to disable physics in the graph output toolbar so you can tweak node placements. As drawn from the statistics view for this graph, AIKG generated 38 nodes, 105 edges, 52 extracted edges, 53 inferred edges, and four communities. You can further filter as you see fit, but even unfiltered, and with just a little by of tuning at the presentation layer, we can immediately see success where semantic triples immediately emerge to excellent effect. We can see entity/relationship connections where, as an example, threat actor –> targeted –> people and people –> associated with –> think tanks, with direct reference to the aforementioned OWA portal and Turkish language. If you’re a cyberthreat intelligence analyst (CTI) or investigator, drawing visual conclusions derived from text processing will really help you step up your game in the form of context and enrichment in report writing. This same graph extends itself to represent the connection between the victims and the exploitation methods and infrastructure. If you don’t want to go through a full installation process for yourself to complete your own model execution, you should still grab the JSON and HTML output files and experiment with them in your browser. You’ll get a real sense of the power and impact of an interactive knowledge graph with the joint forces power of LLM and SPO triplets.
For a second experiment I selected related content in a longer, more in depth analysis courtesy of a CISA Cybersecurity Advisory (CISA friends, I’m pulling for you in tough times). If you are following along at home, be sure to exit ollama so you can rerun it with additional parameters (27b vs 12b); pass /bye as a message, and restart:

Given the density and length of this article, the graph as initially rendered is a bit untenable (no fault of AIKG) and requires some tuning and filtering for optimal effect. Graph Statistics for this experiment included 118 nodes, 486 edges, 152 extracted edges, 334 inferred edges, and seven communities. To filter, with a focus again on actions taken by Russian APT operatives, I chose as follows:

Select a Node by ID: threat actors

Select a network item: Nodes

Select a property: color

Select value(s): #e41a1c (red)

The result is more visually feasible, and allows ready tweaking to optimize network connections, as seen in Figure 2.

Figure 2: AIKG Gemma 3:27b result from CISA advisory

Shocking absolutely no one, we immediately encapsulate actor activity specific to credential access and influence operations via shell commands, Active Directory commands, and PowerShell commands. The conclusive connection is drawn however as threat actors –> targets –> defense industry. Ya think? ;-) In the advisory, see Description of Targets, including defense industry, as well as Initial Access TTPs, including credential guessing and brute force, and finally Post-Compromise TTPs and Exfiltration regarding various shell and AD commands. As a security professional reading this treatise, its reasonable to assume you’ve read a CISA Cybersecurity Advisory before. As such, its also reasonable to assume you’ll agree that knowledge graph generation from a highly dense, content rich collection of IOCs and behaviors is highly useful. I intend to work with my workplace ML team to further incorporate the principles explored herein as part of our context and enrichment generation practices. I suggest you consider the same if you have the opportunity. While SPO triplets, aka semantic triples, are most often associated with search engine optimization (SEO), their use, coupled with LLM power, really shines for threat intelligence applications.

Cheers…until next time.

2026 State of Security

Explore the intelligence from Recorded Future's Insikt Group annual threat landscape analysis: the definitive report on how geopolitical fragmentation, state-sponsored operations, and criminal ecosystem evolution are reshaping global risk.

Fragmentation is the new normal

The global threat landscape didn't simplify in 2025—it shattered. Geopolitical alliances strained. Criminal enterprises splintered and regrouped. State-sponsored actors shifted from dramatic disruptions to quiet pre-positioning. And as long-established norms unwound, convergence across once-distinct domains created unprecedented uncertainty.

The 2026 State of Security report delivers Insikt Group's most comprehensive annual analysis of the forces shaping global security—helping leaders reduce surprise, prioritize effectively, and act with confidence.

2025: A year of fragmentation

Geopolitical tensions dominate

Russia-Ukraine War Enters Fourth Year | Geopolitical

India-Pakistan Ballistic Missile Exchanges | Geopolitical

US-Brokered Ceasefire Prevents Escalation | Geopolitical

State-sponsored attacks

Israel-Iran Twelve-Day Conflict | Geopolitical

RedMike Campaign Targets Telecom Infrastructure | State-Sponsored

Chinese Actors Exploit Unpatched Cisco Devices Across 100+ Countries | State-Sponsored

Geopolitical threats and deepfakes

Thailand-Cambodia Border Clashes | Geopolitical

Russian GRU Operations Intensify Against NATO Infrastructure | State-Sponsored

Deepfake-Enabled Fraud Increases 10x Since 2024 | Emerging Technology

Synthetic Identity Fraud Up 300% | Emerging Technology

Law Enforcement Disruptions Fragment Criminal Ecosystems | Cybercrime

The converging threat landscape

Risk moves to the edges

China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea focused not on dramatic attacks but on covert accumulation of access—targeting identity systems, cloud environments, and edge infrastructure where oversight is weakest. The primary risk is no longer a single large-scale incident. It's sustained pre-positioning that enables persistent espionage and creates latent capacity for disruption.

Key Insight: Warning timelines are compressing. The adversaries are already inside.

Convergence across domains

Every major conflict in 2025 had a digital front—and the combatants weren't always who they claimed to be. Genuine intrusions, exaggerated claims, and disinformation reinforced one another across Israel-Iran, India-Pakistan, Thailand-Cambodia, and Russia-Ukraine conflicts.

Key Insight: Perception is now contested terrain. Even low-sophistication attacks generate outsized impact when amplified through coordinated information operations.

Fragmented, modular, resilient

Law enforcement achieved significant wins in 2025. But the criminal ecosystem adapted. Sustained pressure fractured large enterprises into smaller, decentralized operations. Groups adopted subscription models, outsourced operations, and relied on specialized services—creating a distributed criminal supply chain that's resilient and difficult to track.

Key Insight: Threat actors are adapting faster than defenses. Modular ecosystems mean even disrupted operations reconstitute rapidly.

Verification failure at scale

2025 was not a breakout year for AI-driven cyber operations. But the immediate risk isn't autonomous attacks—it's verification failure at scale, where deception becomes faster, cheaper, and more convincing. As AI becomes empowered to take real-world actions through autonomous agents, the attack surface for fraud and manipulation will expand dramatically.

Key Insight: Organizations that act now to establish AI governance and prepare for post-quantum migration will hold significant advantages.

What 2025 teaches us about 2026

The patterns of 2025 point toward a threat environment defined by sustained uncertainty. Security leaders should prepare for:

[23] Recorded Future - Fragmentation Defined 2025's Threat Landscape. Here's What It Means for 2026

Fragmentation Defined 2025's Threat Landscape. Here's What It Means for 2026

Uncertainty has become the operating environment for business. And this year, fragmentation is driving it.

The global threat landscape didn't simplify in 2025; it shattered. Geopolitical alliances strained. Criminal enterprises splintered under law enforcement pressure, then regrouped into smaller, faster, and harder-to-track operations. State-sponsored cyber actors shifted from dramatic disruptions to quiet pre-positioning, embedding themselves in networks and waiting. Hacktivist groups and influence networks amplified conflicts, blurring the line between genuine intrusions and perception warfare.

But here's what makes this moment dangerous: as long-established norms unwind, fragmentation is paradoxically enabling greater interoperability across domains that were once distinct. State objectives, criminal capability, and private-sector technology increasingly reinforce one another. That convergence creates uncertainty, compresses warning time, and expands plausible deniability.

Today, Recorded Future's Insikt Group releases the 2026 State of Security report, our most comprehensive annual analysis of the forces shaping global security.

Drawing on proprietary intelligence, network telemetry, and deep geopolitical analysis, this report examines how 2025's fractures are reshaping the threat environment — and what security leaders must prepare for in the year ahead.

The End of Stability as a Baseline Assumption

For decades, organizations built risk models around a core premise: that the international order would hold, diplomatic mechanisms would constrain escalation, and major powers would avoid direct confrontation.

That premise no longer applies.

In 2025, the international geopolitical order fragmented as hard-power competition, transactional diplomacy, and the testing of red lines became defining features of state behavior. The Russia–Ukraine war ground into its fourth year, with Moscow maintaining a strategic advantage despite minimal territorial gains. Israel and Iran clashed directly in a twelve-day conflict that reshaped regional power dynamics. India and Pakistan escalated to ballistic missile exchanges before a US-brokered ceasefire intervened. Thailand and Cambodia exchanged fire along disputed borders, triggering the most intense fighting in nearly fifteen years.

The pattern is clear: states are increasingly willing to use force to advance objectives when diplomatic mechanisms appear unreliable. As modern power struggles threaten institutions like international law, risk is spreading across domains that have historically had clearer boundaries.

For organizations, this means geopolitical crises are increasingly likely to spill over into corporate networks, supply chains, regulatory environments, and digital infrastructure with limited warning. Resilience, not stability, became the baseline operating assumption.

State-Sponsored Actors: Risk Moves to the Edges

While kinetic conflicts dominated headlines, some of 2025's most consequential state-sponsored activity unfolded quietly in digital environments — at the edges of networks where oversight is weakest.

China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea, also known as the four most capable and consistently active hostile state cyber actors Insikt Group tracks, focused not on dramatic attacks but on the covert accumulation of access. They targeted identity systems, cloud environments, and edge infrastructure: the poorly monitored network devices, VPN appliances, and perimeter systems that organizations struggle to patch and defend.

Insikt Group's reporting on RedMike highlighted disciplined pre-positioning in telecommunications infrastructure: access built selectively and held quietly for intelligence value by threat actors ready to pivot quickly when timing and pressure align. Chinese state-sponsored actors targeted telecommunications providers worldwide, with one campaign exploiting unpatched Cisco devices across more than 100 countries. Russian GRU-linked groups intensified operations against critical infrastructure in Ukraine and NATO member states. Iranian operators blended espionage with hack-and-leak campaigns. North Korean actors merged revenue generation with espionage, deploying fraudulent IT workers embedded in foreign companies as an access vector.

The strategic shift is profound: the primary risk is no longer a single, large-scale cyber incident. It's sustained pre-positioning that enables persistent espionage in peacetime and creates latent capacity for disruption during crises. Warning timelines are compressing, as the adversaries are already inside.

Hacktivists and Influence Operators: Convergence Across Domains

Every major conflict in 2025 had a digital front, and unsurprisingly, the combatants weren't always who they claimed to be.

Hacktivist groups, patriotic volunteers, and influence networks played growing roles in conflicts involving Israel–Iran, India–Pakistan, Thailand–Cambodia, and Russia–Ukraine. These actors operated with varying degrees of state alignment but consistently contributed to a threat landscape where genuine intrusions, exaggerated claims, and disinformation reinforced one another.

Regional escalation involving Israel and Iran showed how cyber operations, influence campaigns, and commercial surveillance tools can operate alongside military force, as domains converge in ways that would have seemed implausible just years ago. During the India–Pakistan escalation, both sides deployed large-scale influence networks that spread coordinated narratives, forged military documents, and amplified hacktivist claims of grid disruptions. Russian-aligned hacktivists targeted NATO countries with DDoS campaigns, with investigations revealing that portions of this "hacktivist" ecosystem function as state-directed fronts.

The implication for defenders: perception is now contested terrain. Even low-sophistication attacks can generate outsized reputational and psychological impact when amplified through coordinated information operations.

Cybercrime: Fragmented, Modular, Resilient

Law enforcement achieved significant wins against cybercriminal infrastructure in 2025. Forum takedowns, arrests, and sanctions disrupted major operations. Ransomware payments declined for the second consecutive year.

But the criminal ecosystem just adapted to these new conditions.

Sustained pressure fractured large criminal enterprises into smaller, more decentralized operations. Insikt Group identified 289 new ransomware variants this year (a 33% increase from 2024), most of which were derived from leaked source code. Groups adopted subscription models, outsourced operations, and relied on specialized services for laundering and negotiation. The result: a distributed criminal supply chain that's resilient, decentralized, and increasingly difficult to track.

Cybercrime groups increasingly aligned with national strategic objectives, blurring the boundaries between criminal and state activity. In Venezuela, state action eroded legal, political, and cyber boundaries, challenging assumptions about sovereignty and accountability. Mercenary spyware pursued the same persistent-access goals as state actors, embedding where oversight was weakest and adapting under pressure.

English-speaking criminal actors, such as the Scattered LAPSUS$ Hunters collective, demonstrated that low-tech social engineering tactics — particularly help desk impersonation — remain devastatingly effective. Meanwhile, organized crime in Southeast Asia industrialized fraud at an unprecedented scale, with Chinese-speaking transnational criminal organizations running call center compounds using coerced labor augmented by AI-driven automation.

For organizations, the takeaway is stark: threat actors are adapting faster than defenders. Modular criminal ecosystems that share tools, infrastructure, and access can reconstitute rapidly even after disruptions.

Emerging Technologies: Verification Failure at Scale

2025 was not a breakout year for AI-driven cyber operations.

To separate hype from signal, Insikt Group developed AIM3 — our framework for assessing AI malware maturity. It shows that most observed use remains at an early stage of development. Threat actors experimented with malicious AI models tailored for cyber operations, but the results were incremental rather than transformative.

The immediate risk is not autonomous attacks. It's verification failure at scale, where deception becomes faster, cheaper, and more convincing as AI is embedded into decision workflows.

Deepfake-enabled fraud has increased more than tenfold since the start of 2024. Synthetic identity fraud rose 300% in Q1 2025 alone. Adversaries began testing prompt injection attacks and "generated-SEO" manipulation to poison AI search results. As AI becomes empowered to take real-world actions through autonomous agents, the attack surface for fraud and manipulation will expand dramatically.

At the strategic level, the US–China race for AI dominance intensified, with China pursuing an aggressive diffusion strategy that's embedding Chinese LLMs into the global software ecosystem. Competition over quantum computing, advanced robotics, and space systems is extending beyond commercial markets into sustained geopolitical rivalry.

The organizations that act now to establish AI governance, inventory cryptographic dependencies, and prepare for post-quantum migration will hold significant advantages as these technologies mature.

What 2025 Teaches Us About 2026

Looking ahead, diplomatic friction, selective enforcement of norms, and accelerating technology adoption will continue to widen the gap between how risk is assumed to behave and how it actually behaves.

The patterns of 2025 point toward a 2026 threat environment defined by sustained uncertainty:

Simultaneous regional crises will become the norm. As enforcement of established norms becomes more selective, regional and emerging powers will pursue objectives more aggressively, and external intervention in internal conflicts will expand.

Connectivity disruptions will emerge as a primary tool of coercion. Undersea cables, satellite systems, and positioning/navigation/timing infrastructure are becoming strategic targets, with even limited interference capable of cascading across critical sectors.

Ransomware will fragment further. Declining payments will push threat actors toward shorter attack cycles, lower demands, and disruption-focused tactics designed to compel engagement.

The synthetic identity crisis will deepen. AI-enabled deepfakes and compromised identity verification systems will make business email compromise and social engineering more convincing and scalable.

AI will become the next great attack surface. Prompt-based manipulation will increasingly replace code-based exploits as the preferred intrusion method against AI systems.

Quantum readiness will move from planning to spending. Organizations will begin allocating dedicated budgets for cryptographic inventories, vendor transitions, and post-quantum migration pilots.

Robots and space systems will become contested cyber-physical terrain. In 2026, humanoid robots and space infrastructure will move from experimentation to operational deployment, increasing economic and strategic reliance on network-connected cyber-physical systems.

Intelligence does not eliminate uncertainty; having more access to more data points means nothing without context. Rather, intelligence makes the uncertainty more manageable.

Fragmentation creates complexity. But complexity rewards those who can see connections others miss, such as how risks across geopolitics, cyber operations, and criminal ecosystems converge to shape exposure. That's the purpose of the 2026 State of Security report: not just to catalog threats, but to help leaders reduce surprise, prioritize effectively, and act with confidence.

The full report includes detailed analysis of each threat domain, threat actor profiles, regional risk assessments, and actionable recommendations for building organizational resilience.

From 27 Steps to 5: How Recorded Future Reimagined Threat Hunting with Autonomous Threat Operations

The manual operations gap can be a business risk

Manual threat hunting requires 27 steps that burn analyst time

Autonomous Threat Operations can reduce 27 steps to 5

Autonomous operations prove measurable ROI

At Recorded Future, we’re constantly looking for ways to help security teams work more efficiently so they can focus their expertise where it matters most: stopping threats before they impact business.

Over the past few years, as we spent time talking to our customers and observing the ways that their SOCs actually work day to day, we discovered a troubling pattern. Every Monday morning, analysts would begin a new round of threat hunts, manually gathering intelligence, writing queries for different tools, correlating findings, and documenting results. By Friday, they’d complete their reports. Meanwhile, attackers who may have breached the network on Tuesday may have already moved laterally, established persistence, and potentially exfiltrated data.

The manual operations gap

This inefficient approach to threat hunting wasn’t a people problem. It was a process problem.

We identified that traditional manual threat hunting required 27 separate steps, from selecting threat actors and gathering intelligence sources to validating anomalies and writing up reports for stakeholders.

Each of the 27 steps consumed hours of analyst time, and the entire manual workflow created what we now call the manual operations gap—the dangerous window between when threats emerge and when security teams can respond.

Rather than accept this gap as an inevitable reality, we asked ourselves a question: How many more threats could be prevented, and how could we improve organizations’ defenses overall, if we could make manual threat operations autonomous?

Rethinking manual workflows

Threat hunting represented the perfect use case for autonomous operations. It’s a critical security function that’s highly repetitive, spans multiple tools, requires constant updates as threats evolve, and must happen continuously—not just during business hours. We knew that if we could bring autonomous functionality to threat hunting, we could demonstrate a new model for security operations.

The breakthrough came from reimagining the entire workflow around a few core principles: intelligence-driven automation, seamless cross-tool orchestration, and continuous autonomous operations. Instead of analysts manually translating intelligence into queries for each security tool, what if their systems could automatically initiate hunts across SIEM, EDR, and other platforms simultaneously? Instead of analysts having to schedule weekly hunt cycles, what if threat hunting could run 24/7, adapting in real time as new intelligence emerged?

The result of this reimagining is Autonomous Threat Operations and the autonomous threat hunting capability, a new solution that reduces 27 manual steps to as few as 5 largely automated ones, delivering the speed, scale, and effectiveness that the modern threat landscape demands.

Closing the gap with autonomous operations

The transition from manual bottlenecks to autonomous operations isn't just about working faster—it's about working smarter. Security teams need workflows that scale their expertise rather than limit it, systems that integrate their existing investments rather than replace them, and processes that prove measurable ROI to justify continued investment.

Organizations that standardize on intelligence-led operations often demonstrate measurable gains in time to detect and time to respond. They can close the gap between threat emergence and defensive action, transforming security from a reactive cost center into a proactive risk-reduction function.

Want to see exactly how leading organizations are making this transformation? Our new playbook breaks down the specific steps for moving from manual threat hunting to autonomous operations—including the precise methodology for reducing complex, multi-day processes into streamlined workflows that run continuously.

Discover how to eliminate workflow bottlenecks, achieve 24/7 threat coverage, and prove the ROI of your security investments in the autonomous era.

[25] Cyberscoop - Proofpoint acquires Acuvity to tackle the security risks of agentic AI

[TAM METİN - 581 kelime]
Proofpoint announced Thursday it has acquired Acuvity, an AI security startup, as the cybersecurity company moves to address security risks stemming from widespread corporate adoption of agentic AI.

The acquisition strengthens Proofpoint‘s capabilities in monitoring and securing AI-powered systems that are increasingly handling sensitive business functions across enterprises.

Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, but Ryan Kalember, Proofpoint’s chief strategy officer, told CyberScoop that the acquisition was beyond a pure “technology acquisition,” with Acuvity’s engineering team slated to join the California-based company.

Acuvity specializes in visibility and governance for AI applications, including the ability to track how employees and automated systems interact with external AI services and protect custom AI models developed within organizations. The startup’s platform monitors AI usage across multiple deployments, from web browsers to specialized infrastructure including Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and locally installed AI tools.

The deal reflects growing concern among enterprises about security gaps created as organizations deploy agentic AI across departments, like software development, customer support, finance, and legal operations. These systems increasingly access sensitive data and execute tasks previously handled exclusively by humans.

Additionally, AI-specific attack vectors such as prompt injection and model manipulation have emerged as potential threats that traditional cybersecurity tools were not designed to address.

Kalember said CISOs are seeing the potential risk combined with agentic AI growth, and are sensing the need to maintain governance without impeding innovation, particularly as the pace of AI adoption has outstripped many companies’ ability to secure these systems effectively.

“It has definitely been a pivot from, ‘I got to be able to stop prompt injection’ to ‘I have to be able to figure out what the AI is even doing,’” he told CyberScoop.

Last May, Proofpoint acquired Hornetsecurity Group, a Germany-based provider of Microsoft 365 security services, in a deal reportedly valued at more than $1 billion. Kalember told CyberScoop he sees Acuvity helping small- and medium-sized organizations that leverage Hornetsecurity’s offerings to boost its AI security.

“That is going to be a world in which, independent of the size of the organization, they are going to very much leverage AI, and some of that will be built into the tools like M365 that is tightly coupled with the Hornetsecurity architecture,” Kalember said.The acquisition follows a theme within the industry where larger security companies are buying AI-focused security startups. Just last week, data security firm Varonis acquired AI security firm AllTrue.ai for $150 million.

[26] Cyberscoop - Apple discloses first actively exploited zero-day of 2026

[TAM METİN - 527 kelime]
Apple disclosed a zero-day vulnerability Wednesday that the vendor warned was previously “exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals,” the company said in a security update.

The memory-corruption vulnerability — CVE-2026-20700 — affects iPhones and iPads and was exploited on devices running versions of iOS before iOS 26. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency added the defect to its known exploited vulnerabilities catalog Thursday.

The disclosure marks the first zero-day reported by Apple since late 2025, and the first Apple defect flagged as actively exploited by CISA this year.

“An attacker with memory write capability may be able to execute arbitrary code,” the company said.

Apple, which typically shares limited details about in-the-wild exploitation of zero-days, noted the latest zero-day, similar to others it disclosed last year, was exploited by sophisticated attackers targeting distinct people.

The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment and did not describe the nature or objectives of the attacks.

Caitlin Condon, vice president of security research at VulnCheck, said the zero-day was likely exploited as part of a highly targeted spyware or surveillance attack on a very small number of individuals’ devices.

The zero-day vulnerability, which was discovered by Google Threat Intelligence Group, affects dyld, Apple’s open-source dynamic link editor that acts as a core system component to securely load applications on users’ devices.

Apple said a pair of additional vulnerabilities affecting WebKit — CVE-2025-14174 and CVE-2025-43529 — were previously disclosed in response to attacks involving CVE-2026-20700.

The company did not describe how the three vulnerabilities are related, but previously noted CVE-2025-43529 was “exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals.”

All three of the memory-corruption defects affect mobile operating systems, “where sophisticated zero-day attacks are commonly employed to surveil individuals, whether those are political dissidents, journalists, public figures or other high-value targets,” Condon said.

“Memory-corruption exploits are also commonly seen in sophisticated attacks, as they’re tricky to exploit reliably but provide elevated access,” she added.

Apple’s security updates for iOS 26.3 and iPadOS 26.3 addresses 38 vulnerabilities total, but CVE-2026-20700 is the only defect it disclosed as actively exploited prior to public disclosure.

[27] Cyberscoop - Google finds state-sponsored hackers use AI at ‘all stages’ of attack cycle 
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Thu, 12 Feb 2026 21:24:46 +0000

[TAM METİN - 731 kelime]
A new report from Google found evidence that state-sponsored hacking groups have leveraged AI tool Gemini at nearly every stage of the cyber attack cycle.

The research underscores how AI tools have matured in their cyber offensive capabilities, even as it doesn’t reveal novel or paradigm shifting uses of the technology.

John Hultquist, chief analyst at Google’s Threat Intelligence Group, told CyberScoop that many countries still appear to be experimenting with AI tools, determining where they best fit into the attack chain and provide more benefit than friction.

“Nobody’s got everything completely worked out,” Hultquist said. “They’re all trying to figure this out and that goes for attacks on AI, too.”

But the report also reveals that frontier AI models can build speed, scale and sophistication into a myriad of hacking tasks, and state-sponsored hacking groups are taking advantage.

Gemini was a useful, dynamic and convenient tool for many tasks, helping threat actors in a variety of different ways. In nearly all cases, Google’s reporting suggests that state-sponsored actors relied on Gemini as one tool among many, using it for specific purposes such as automating routine processes, conducting research or reconnaissance and experimenting with malware.

One North Korean group used it to synthesize open-source intelligence about job roles and salary information at cybersecurity and defense companies. Another North Korean group consulted it “multiple days a week” for technical support, using it to troubleshoot problems and generate new malware code when they got stuck during an operation. One Iranian APT used Gemini to “significantly augment reconnaissance” techniques against targeted victims. China, Russia, Iran and North Korea all also used Gemini to create fake articles, personas, and other assets for information operations.

“What’s so interesting about this capability is it’s going to have an effect across the entire intrusion cycle,” Hultquist said.

There are no instances of state groups using Gemini to automate large portions of a cyber attack, like a Chinese-government backed campaign identified by Anthropic last year. It suggests threat actors may still be struggling to implement fully or mostly-automated hacks using AI.

Hultquist said that some state groups, particularly those focused on espionage, may not find the speed and scale advantages of agentic AI useful if it results in louder, more detectable operations. In fact, while state actors continue to experiment with AI models, he believes on average these developments will help smaller cybercriminal outfits more than state-sponsored hackers.

But that could change in the future. Frontier AI companies like Anthropic and cybersecurity startups like XBOW have already developed models with powerful defensive cybersecurity capabilities in vulnerability scanning, reconnaissance and automation. Foreign governments with similar technology could use those same features for offensive hacking, as Chinese actors did with Claude before being discovered.

In December, the UK AI Security Institute’s inaugural report on frontier AI trends found that Al capabilities are improving rapidly across all tested domains, and particularly in cybersecurity.

And the gap between frontier and free, open-source models is shrinking. According to the institute, open-source AI models can now catch up and provide similar capabilities within 4-8 months of a frontier model release.

“The duration of cyber tasks that Al systems can complete without human direction is also rising steeply, from less than 10 minutes in early 2023 to over an hour by mid-2025,” the institute said in its Frontier AI Trends Report in December.

[28] The Register - Google patches Chrome zero-day as in-the-wild exploits surface

Google patches Chrome zero-day as in-the-wild exploits surface

High-severity CSS flaw let malicious webpages run code inside the sandbox

Google has quietly pushed out an emergency Chrome fix after attackers were caught exploiting the browser's first reported zero-day of 2026.

The flaw, tracked as CVE-2026-2441 and assigned a "high" CVSS score of 8.8, stems from a use-after-free bug in Chrome's CSS handling that could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code inside the browser's sandbox using a specially crafted HTML page. In other words, a dodgy webpage could be all an attacker needs to get malicious code running inside a victim's browser.

Unsurprisingly, Google has rushed out fixes for Chrome with version 145.0.7632.75 for Windows and Mac, and 144.0.7559.75 for Linux, which the Chocolate Factory says will "roll out in the coming days/weeks."

Security researcher Shaheen Fazim reported the flaw on February 11, and Google acknowledged that attackers were already exploiting it just two days later – though it's staying tight-lipped on the specifics. The company has not said whether the attacks were targeted or part of a broader exploitation campaign, only that the vulnerability was being abused before a fix was ready.

"Google is aware that an exploit for CVE-2026-2441 exists in the wild," its security advisory stated.

Google said access to further details about the bug will remain under wraps until most users are patched, and potentially longer if third-party dependencies are involved, a standard move aimed at stopping others from quickly weaponizing the bug.

If this all feels a bit familiar, that's because it is. Google spent much of last year playing Whac-A-Mole with actively exploited Chrome bugs, ultimately patching eight zero-days across 2025.

The fix also lands days after researchers revealed that at least 287 Chrome extensions, with tens of millions of installs between them, were quietly siphoning off users' browsing histories to a long list of outside recipients – a handy reminder that data can leak not just through software flaws but through the sprawling ecosystem bolted onto the browser. ®

Infosec exec sold eight zero-day exploit kits to Russia, says DoJ

PLUS: Fake ransomware group exposed; EC blesses Google's big Wiz deal; Alleged sewage hacker cuffed; And more

Infosec in Brief The former General Manager of defense contractor L3Harris’s cyber subsidiary Trenchant sold eight zero-day exploit kits to Russia, according to a court filing last week.

We first wrote about this case in October 2025, when former Trenchant boss Peter Williams pleaded guilty to two counts of theft of trade secrets – but court records didn’t detail exactly what he stole.

That changed last week when the US Department of Justice published a sentencing memorandum [PDF] that frames Williams’ conduct as a betrayal of his employer and the US government, and the cause of significant harm to US national security.

Williams "made it possible for the Russian Broker to arm its clients with powerful cyber exploits that could be used against any manner of victim, civilian or military around the world," the DoJ said. The broker Williams worked with regularly provided exploits to the Russian government, the DoJ alleged.

Along with the damage he caused to US national security, the DoJ said that Williams' actions also led to the loss of more than $35 million for L3Harris and Trenchant, contributing to the government's call to sentence him to the maximum term allowed under federal guidelines.

The sentencing memo notes that Williams could be incarcerated for up to 108 months (9 years), followed by three years of supervised release. An Australian citizen, Williams has agreed to be deported to his home country after his prison term.

In addition to his time behind bars, the DoJ has also asked the judge to force Williams to pay $35 million in restitution and additional forfeitures of items linked to his crimes.

Ransomware gang turns out to be a couple of kids in a trench coat

A recently emerged ransomware group calling itself 0APT is just a bunch of liars who haven't hacked anyone, cybersecurity researchers have determined.

According to GuidePoint Security, 0APT's claim of having successfully attacked over 200 entities in the course of a single week in late January was a total fabrication, with most claimed victims having ridiculous names like "Metropolis City Municipal." As reports emerged that people thought the group was lying, its data leak site went offline before returning to life a day later with a list of around 15 high-profile multinational victims listed.

GuidePoint says companies on the shortlist also appear to have escaped infection by 0APT – the alleged victims found no evidence of intrusion after the group published their names.

GuidePoint believes there could be two reasons for the scam: Either to fool other cybercriminals into paying it for ransomware-as-a-service tools that don't exist, or to trick organizations into believing they have suffered an attack so they pay ransoms out of fear.

In other words, if 0APT claims to have hit your organization, it probably hasn't – but review your logs just in case.

Payment deadlines extended after actual ransomware attack hits BridgePay

People around the United States are getting a little more time to pay their local government bills following a ransomware attack that's taken payment service provider BridgePay offline for more than a week.

BridgePay provides payment services for local governments and utilities around the country – or it did until knocked offline on February 6 due to a ransomware attack. BridgePay remains offline at the time of publication and warns restoring services could take the better part of another week.

The company said attackers did not compromise payment information, but it still doesn't appear to understand the full extent of the incident. BridgePay said it will provide updates as it learns more.

At least one city, Frisco, Texas, has suspended shutoffs and late fees until the situation is resolved, but not everyone is so fortunate – Palm Bay, Florida's advice on the outage suggests residents ought to hoof it to a city building to pay what's owed.

The CBZC said that the suspect gained unauthorized access to the critical infrastructure provider, logged into an administrator account and stole data. The data later appeared on the dark web.

Polish police claim that their actions in the western Polish city of Poznań enabled them to locate and delete the data and to make the arrest.

EU clears Google's Wiz acquisition

Google's acquisition of cloud security firm Wiz is one step closer to completion, with the EU last week clearing the deal.

The EU said that Google's acquisition of Wiz wouldn't raise competition concerns in Europe, as the likes of AWS and Azure offer their own strong cloud security packages.

"There are several credible competitors that customers could switch to if Google were to bundle Wiz's multi-cloud security platform with its existing products, or in case Wiz's platform no longer worked with clouds other than Google's," the European Commission said. The deal was also cleared by the US Department of Justice in November 2025.

Google previously tried to acquire Wiz in 2024 for $23 billion, but the cloudy security outfit rejected the offer. Google's second offer of $32 billion was enough to change the Wiz team's mind. The deal marks Google's most expensive acquisition to date. ®

Top Dutch telco Odido admits 6.2M customers caught in contact system caper

Names, addresses, bank account numbers accessed – but biz insists passwords and call data untouched

The Netherlands' largest mobile network operator (MNO) has admitted that a breach of its customer contact system may have affected around 6.2 million people.

Odido said that attackers gained access to a range of personal data, including names, home and email addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth, bank account numbers, and ID document details.

The telco insisted that attackers could never have seen passwords, call details, billing or location data, or scans of the ID documents.

It spotted the first signals indicating a breach over the weekend of February 7-8 and promptly reported the incident to the Dutch Data Protection Authority.

Odido said the stolen data has not been published, but warned that it could appear online at some point in the future.

Around 6.2 million people were affected by this attack in some way, the telco told local news media, including its own customers and those of Ben, another MNO owned by Odido. Simpel, a low-budget MNO also under Odido's management, was unaffected.

The company is in the process of informing all affected individuals, either via email (info@mail.odido.nl) or SMS. This message will be tailored to each customer, telling them exactly what personal data was stolen.

In its disclosure, Odido also included tips about what customers should be aware of following the breach, such as scams attackers may attempt using the stolen data for financial gain.

Because names, addresses, phone numbers, and bank account numbers were included in the stolen data, Odido said that cybercriminals may use this to impersonate the telco, the customer's bank, or another third party.

Odido also advised customers about the different ways they can verify a caller's identity if they say they're calling from a bank, and to be wary of fake invoices with company branding, trying to get customers to pay the criminals directly.

CEO Søren Abildgaard said Odido "immediately took additional security measures" after shutting down the attacker's access, as well as informing the data regulator.

"Odido has been affected by a cyberattack, in which customer data has been impacted," said Abildgaard in a letter to customers. "This involves personal data originating from a customer contact system used by Odido. No passwords, call details, or billing data are involved.

"We deeply regret this incident and are fully committed to limiting the impact of this incident and providing our customers with all necessary support. It is important to emphasize that our operational services have not been affected; customers can continue to call, use the internet, and watch TV safely.

"Unauthorized access to the system was ended as quickly as possible. In addition, Odido has engaged external cybersecurity experts to support the implementation of additional security measures as part of the response to this incident."

The Register approached Odido for more information. ®

Homeland Security reportedly sent hundreds of subpoenas seeking to unmask anti-ICE accounts

The Department of Homeland Security has been increasing pressure on tech companies to identify the owners of social media accounts that criticize Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), according to The New York Times.

This echoes other recent reporting, with Bloomberg pointing to five cases in which Homeland Security sought to identify the owners of anonymous Instagram accounts, with the department withdrawing its subpoenas after the owners sued. And a Washington Post story described Homeland Security’s growing use of administrative subpoenas — which do not require the approval of a judge — to target Americans.

Now the NYT says a practice that was previously used sparingly has become increasingly common in recent months, with the department sending hundreds of these subpoenas to Google, Reddit, Discord, and Meta. The subpoenas reportedly focused on accounts that did not have a real name attached and either criticized ICE or described the location of ICE agents.

Google, Meta, and Reddit have reportedly complied in at least some cases. Echoing past comments, Google said that it informs users of these subpoenas when it can, and that it pushes back when the subpoenas are “overbroad.”

[32] TechCrunch Security - Indian pharmacy chain giant exposed customer data and internal systems

A security lapse by one of India’s largest pharmacy chains allowed outsiders to gain full administrative control of its platform, exposing customer order data and sensitive drug-control functions, TechCrunch has exclusively learned.

The issue affected DavaIndia Pharmacy, the pharmacy arm of Zota Healthcare, which operates a large network of retail outlets across India. Security researcher Eaton Zveare told TechCrunch that he discovered the flaw after identifying insecure “super admin” application programming interfaces on DavaIndia’s website and privately shared details with Indian cybersecurity authorities.

The bug is now fixed, and Zveare disclosed his findings.

The exposure comes as Zota Healthcare rapidly scales DavaIndia Pharmacy’s retail business. The Gujarat-headquartered company operates more than 2,300 DavaIndia stores across India, including 276 new outlets announced in January, and plans to add another 1,200 to 1,500 over the next two years.

Zveare told TechCrunch that the flaw stemmed from insecure admin interfaces, which allowed unauthenticated users to create “super admin” accounts with high privileges.

With that level of access, an attacker could view thousands of online orders containing customer information, modify product listings and prices, create discount coupons, and change settings governing whether certain medicines required a prescription, the researcher said.

Based on system timestamps, Zveare said the vulnerable administrative interfaces appeared to have been live since late 2024. The access exposed nearly 17,000 online orders and administrative controls spanning 883 stores, he said, allowing changes to product pricing, prescription requirements, and promotional discounts. Zveare said the access allowed edits to website content that could have been used for defacement or disruption.

Pharmacy order data can be particularly sensitive, as it may reveal information about a person’s health conditions, medications or other private purchases. Exposure of such data, even without evidence of misuse, carries heightened privacy and patient-safety risks compared with other consumer information.

“Customer information was linked to their orders,” said Zveare. “This includes name, phone numbers, email IDs, mailing addresses, total amount paid, and the products purchased. Since this is a pharmacy, the products being purchased could be considered private and even embarrassing for some people.”

Zveare said he reported the issue to CERT-In, India’s national cyber emergency response agency, in August 2025. The vulnerability was fixed within weeks, though confirmation from the company took longer and was provided to the cyber authorities in late November, he said.

Sujit Paul, chief executive of Zota Healthcare, did not respond to emails sent by TechCrunch last month. The researcher said there was no indication the flaw had been exploited before it was patched.

Fintech lending giant Figure confirms data breach

Figure Technology, a blockchain-based lending company, confirmed it experienced a data breach.

On Friday, Figure spokesperson Alethea Jadick told TechCrunch in a statement that the breach originated when an employee was tricked with a social engineering attack that allowed the hackers to steal “a limited number of files.”

The statement said the company is communicating “with partners and those impacted,” and offering free credit monitoring “to all individuals who receive a notice.”

Figure’s spokesperson did not respond to a series of specific questions about the breach.

The hacking group ShinyHunters took responsibility for the hack on its official dark web leak website, saying the company refused to pay a ransom, and published 2.5 gigabytes of allegedly stolen data.

TechCrunch saw a portion of the data, which included customers’ full names, home addresses, dates of birth, and phone numbers.

A member of ShinyHunters told TechCrunch that Figure was among the victims of a hacking campaign that targeted customers who rely on the single sign-on provider Okta. Other victims of the campaign include Harvard University and the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn).

[34] CSO Online - Leaky Chrome extensions with 37M installs caught divulging your browsing history

Leaky Chrome extensions with 37M installs caught divulging your browsing history

Hundreds of popular add‑ons used encrypted, URL‑sized payloads to send search queries, referrers, and timestamps to outside servers, in some cases tied to data brokers and unknown operators.

An estimated 37 million worldwide installations of a clutch of leaky Chrome extensions are transmitting users’ browsing histories to external servers.

According to findings by an independent security researcher using the pseudonym “Q Continuum,” a total of 287 extensions sent data that closely matched the URLs visited during simulated browsing sessions.

“The actors behind the leaks span the spectrum: Similarweb, Curly Doggo, Offidocs, Chinese actors, many smaller obscure data-brokers, and a mysterious ‘Big Star Labs’ that appears to be an extended arm of Similarweb,” the researcher said. To conduct the analysis, the researcher built an automated pipeline that launched Chrome instances, installed extensions, visited a predefined set of websites, and captured outbound communications.

Extensions include VPNs, productivity tools, and shopping add-ons

The research identified numerous widely distributed extensions with risky behavior across categories such as VPN/proxy services, coupon finders, PDF tools, and browser utilities. Many of these have hundreds of thousands or millions of users.

A few of these extensions include Pop up blocker for Chrome, Stylish, BlockSite block Websites, Stay Focused, SimilarWeb – Website traffic and SEO Checker, WOT: Website Security and Safety Checker, Smarty, Video Ad Blocker Plus for YouTube, Knowee AI, and CrxMouse: Mouse Gestures.

According to the researcher, several of the extensions requested broad host permissions (cross-websites). This allowed them to observe navigation events and page activity across domains. “If an extension is just reading the page title or injecting CSS, its network footprint should stay flat regardless of how long the URL we visit is,” the researcher said, explaining the logic behind their flagging.

“If the outbound traffic grows linearly with the URL length, we have a high probability that the extension is shipping the URL itself (or the entire HTTP request) to a remote server.”

Encrypted exfiltration made detection difficult

The researcher said in a blog post that several of these extensions attempted to hide the nature of transmitted data. Outbound payloads were frequently encrypted or encoded before transmission, preventing automated inspection.

“Manual inspection of the captured traffic revealed a variety of obfuscation schemes: base64, ROT47, LZ-String compression, and full AES-256 encryption wrapped in RSA-OAEP,” the researcher said in a separate report published on the findings. “Decoding these payloads showed raw Google search URLs, page referrers, user IDs, and timestamps being sent to a network of proprietary domains and cloud-provider endpoints.

The researcher’s testing environment ran Chrome inside a Docker container, allowing each extension to be isolated and analyzed consistently.

“We should note that probably not all of the browser history leaking extensions have malicious intent,” the researcher said, clarifying they had to manually remove a few false positives from the logs of extensions tagged by their automated scanner. “Some of the extensions might be benign and may need to collect browser history for functionality such as ‘Avast Online Security & Privacy,’ for example.”

The disclosure included a list of Chrome Web Store URLs and actors behind these extensions for reference.

[35] CSO Online - Finding a common language around risk

Finding a common language around risk

Siloed cyber, operations and strategy teams undermine risk management; unified culture and governance turn fragmented risk into resilience.

Here’s what nobody tells you about risk management: your cyber team speaks Klingon, your operations folks speak Elvish and your strategy people speak ancient Greek. And somehow, you expect them all to protect the same castle.

We’ve watched this play out more times than we care to count. The CISO warns about ransomware threats. Operations worries about supply chain breakdowns. The board obsesses over market disruption. They’re all talking about risk, but they might as well be on different planets. When the crisis hits (and it always does), everyone scrambles in their own direction while the place burns down.

These teams are brilliant at what they do. The problem is that risk has been carved up like a Thanksgiving turkey, with each department claiming their favorite piece. Cyber gets the drumstick, operations takes the breast, strategy grabs the wings. Nobody’s looking at the whole bird.

This fragmentation kills companies. Enron didn’t collapse because it lacked smart people or fancy frameworks. It died because information was sanitized, altered or otherwise modified as it moved up the chain. Leadership told one story, the books showed another and, in some cases, ground operators had no clue what was actually happening. When the truth finally surfaced, trust evaporated overnight. Billions vanished. The largest bankruptcy in U.S. history at the time.

That’s what happens when risk lives in silos.

The three languages problem

Walk into any organization and you’ll hear three distinct dialects of risk.

Cybersecurity teams talk in terms of vulnerabilities, threat actors and zero-days. They live in a world where attacks evolve faster than defenses and one misconfigured server can expose millions of records. Their risk language is technical, immediate and often terrifying.

Operations speaks of process failures, human error and business continuity. They worry about the mundane things that actually break companies: the supplier who goes bankrupt overnight, the employee who clicks the wrong link, the warehouse fire that stops production for weeks. Their risk language is practical, grounded in what can go wrong today.

Strategy thinks in market shifts, competitive threats and business model obsolescence. They’re playing chess while everyone else plays checkers; trying to spot the disruption before it arrives. Their risk language is abstract, long term and maddeningly uncertain.

None of them is wrong. But none of them is complete either.

When Netflix faced potential extinction from Blockbuster’s competing service in the early 2000s, they didn’t just fix their technology, tweak their operations or revise their strategy. They aligned all three. Leadership made a bold strategic call to pivot to streaming. Operations transformed their entire delivery model. Technology became the foundation instead of a support function. They spoke one language across all domains.

Blockbuster kept its domains separate. Strategy made decisions without understanding operational constraints. Operations couldn’t adapt fast enough. Technology lagged behind market needs. We know how that story ended.

Building one culture from three languages

The Organizational Risk Culture Standard (ORCS) offers something most frameworks miss: it treats culture as the foundation, not the afterthought. You can’t bolt culture onto existing processes and call it done. Culture is how people actually think about risk when no one is watching. It’s the shared beliefs that guide decisions under pressure.

Think of it as a dynamic system in which people, processes and technology must dance together. People are the operators who judge and act on risks. Processes provide standards, so they don’t have to improvise in a crisis. Technology provides tools to detect patterns, monitor threats and respond faster than human reflexes.

But here’s the catch: these three elements have to align across all three risk domains. Your cybersecurity team needs to understand how their decisions affect operations. Your operations team needs to grasp strategic implications. Your strategy folks need to stop treating cyber and operational risks as someone else’s problem.

This alignment happens through four pillars that actually make sense.

Integrate across domains

First, leadership and governance have to integrate across domains. Not just a CISO reporting to the CIO while the COO does their own thing, while the board gets quarterly updates and the corporate risk team is nowhere to be seen in cyber.

Real integration means cross-functional committees where cyber, operations, risk and strategy people sit together, speak the same language and make decisions as one unit. It means leaders who model the behavior they want to see, who ask about cross-domain impacts before approving anything significant.

Establish a system of unified risk intelligence

Second, you need unified risk intelligence. Cyber threat intelligence can’t live in a bubble. When your security team spots a phishing campaign targeting your industry, operations needs to know because it affects their people. Strategy needs to know because it signals competitive intelligence gathering. Risk intelligence flows across boundaries or it’s just noise.

This requires applying the ORCS standard’s concept of adaptive elasticity. Organizations that survive aren’t rigid. They bend. They recalibrate. When conditions shift, they adjust their risk appetite and tolerance in real time. They don’t wait for the annual strategy review to realize the world changed six months ago.

Unify your risk appetite and communicate it

Third, you establish a unified risk appetite and a unified communication framework. Most organizations have implicit risk appetites that vary wildly by department. Cyber might be risk-averse while strategy takes big swings and operations splits the difference. That’s not a strategy. That’s chaos with a budget.

Clear risk appetite means everyone knows which risks you’ll pursue and which you won’t touch. Risk tolerance sets the boundaries. When you cross them, alarms go off and people escalate. No guessing. No freelancing. No surprises.

Communication makes this real. Transparent information sharing across domains. Psychological safety so people can raise concerns without getting their heads bitten off. When Red Lobster’s endless shrimp promotion nearly bankrupted them, the new CEO didn’t hide behind PR spin. He went straight to social media, took accountability and engaged directly with customers. That transparency rebuilt trust faster than any marketing campaign could.

Add continuous learning

Fourth, you build continuous learning into the culture. Risk management isn’t a project with an end date. It’s a practice that evolves. You assess your current state, design improvements, implement changes and measure results. Then you do it again. And again.

The ORCS standard provides a maturity model with five levels. Most organizations start at Level 1, where risk management is reactive and fragmented. People improvise. Policies exist on paper, but nobody follows them. Crises catch everyone off guard.

Level 3 is where things get interesting. You have formal frameworks, consistent processes and moderate integration. Risk management becomes part of how you work, not something you do when forced.

Level 5 is where risk becomes a competitive advantage. You anticipate disruptions before they hit. You turn threats into opportunities. Stakeholders trust you because you’ve earned it through consistent, ethical action.

Here’s what implementation looks like in practice, stripped of consultant-speak.

You start by assessing your current state across 10 dimensions: leadership, risk intelligence, ethics, decision-making, risk appetite, communication, technology integration, people development, framework alignment and change management. You’re looking for gaps between domains. Where does information get stuck? Where do decisions get made in isolation? Where do people speak different languages?

Then you design the integration. You create a common risk taxonomy so everyone uses the same terms. You build governance structures that force cross-domain collaboration. You define metrics that matter across all three domains, not just within silos.

Implementation starts small. Pick one high-impact cross-domain risk. Ransomware works well because it touches everything: cyber defenses, operational continuity and strategic reputation. Build your integrated response there. Show it works. Then scale.

You’ll need technology that connects the dots. Risk management platforms that give everyone the same view. Real-time monitoring that spots patterns across domains. Dashboards that executives can actually understand.

But technology is just the enabler. The real work is cultural. Training people to think beyond their domain. Creating incentives that reward collaboration over turf protection. Building feedback loops so lessons learned in one area spread across the whole organization.

Patagonia achieved this by running a full-page ad that read, “Don’t Buy This Jacket.” They acknowledged the environmental cost of their own bestselling product. Risky? Absolutely. But they backed it with operational changes: repair services, recycling programs and resale platforms. They aligned ethics, operations and strategy. Sales jumped 30% the following year because customers trusted them.

When you get this right, the benefits compound.

You see risks earlier because you’re looking at the whole picture, not just your slice. That cyber threat intelligence reveals a supply chain vulnerability. That operational disruption signals a strategic shift in your market. You connect dots that siloed teams miss.

You respond faster because everyone knows the plan. No time wasted arguing about whose problem it is or who should lead the response. The governance structure has already defined roles. The communication channels already exist. You execute.

You make better decisions because you’re balancing risk and opportunity across all domains. You’re not being reckless in strategy while being paranoid in cyber. You’re maintaining the standard’s dynamic risk equilibrium. You take calculated risks that support your goals while staying within boundaries that protect what matters.

Most importantly, you build trust. Employees trust leadership because they see consistent values in action. Customers trust you because you’re transparent when things go wrong. Investors trust you because you demonstrate resilience. Regulators trust you because you align with frameworks such as ISO 31000 and COSO ERM.

Risk stops being something you manage and becomes something you use. Not every organization will get there. Most will stay stuck in their silos, speaking their separate languages, wondering why they keep getting blindsided.

That’s how you build one culture from three languages and turn disruption into advantage. And be the one still standing when the dust settles.

Neue Kooperation soll souveräne Cloud-Lösungen bringen

Hybride Bedrohungen und geopolitische Spannungen machen technologische Unabhängigkeit wichtiger. Eine Behörde und ein Unternehmen wollen zusammen kritische Infrastruktur und die IT sichern.

Das Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik (BSI) und die IT-Sparte der Schwarz Gruppe wollen zusammen die technologische Unabhängigkeit der Verwaltung in Deutschland stärken. Dazu sei auf der Münchner Sicherheitskonferenz eine strategische Kooperation vereinbart worden, erklärten das BSI und Schwarz Digits.

Beide wollen demnach bei der Entwicklung souveräner Cloud-Lösungen für die öffentliche Verwaltung kooperieren, Kontrollschichten entwickeln und sichere Systeme auch für kritische Daten entwickeln. Erklärtes Ziel ist Handlungsfähigkeit gegen hybride Bedrohungen. Zudem geht es um Lagebilder der Cybersicherheit.

“Digitalisierung wird zum Dreh- und Angelpunkt einer sich massiv verändernden Welt – mit Aus- und Wechselwirkungen auf Regeln des Miteinanders, Politik, Macht und staatlichen Interessen. Deutschland und Europa brauchen darauf eine starke Antwort”, erklärte BSI-Präsidentin Claudia Plattner.

Rolf Schumann, Co-CEO von Schwarz Digits, sagte: “Echte digitale Freiheit entsteht nur durch die Kontrolle über eigene Daten und Systeme. Wir verstehen diese Partnerschaft als klares Signal für ein digital souveränes Europa, das seine Werte auch im Cyberraum entschlossen verteidigt.” (dpa/jm)

DNS tunneling is a critical security threat where malicious actors exploit the Domain Name System (DNS) to exfiltrate data and bypass network security controls by embedding unauthorized communications within legitimate DNS queries. This blog presents Infoblox’s machine learning-based detection system that achieves 99.9 percent precision, 99.5 percent recall and a 99.7 percent F1 score in identifying DNS tunneling attacks, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the highest performing DNS tunneling detection system.

Our patented approach combines a convolutional neural network (CNN) autoencoder that generates a reconstruction loss feature with novel statistical and linguistic features extracted from DNS traffic patterns. The autoencoder learns normal DNS query behavior from millions of legitimate domains, producing reconstruction loss values that effectively distinguish between normal and anomalous activity. Our feature engineering captures many characteristics such as query frequency patterns, subdomain entropy, word segmentation ratios and payload size distributions. These features are then processed by a Random Forest classifier for final detection. This system operates in real time on billions of DNS queries daily with low false positive rates, enabling us to automatically block DNS tunneling attempts while preserving legitimate network traffic. Portions of this work were previously presented at CAMLIS and Flocon.

The DNS translates domains (www.google.com) to resource records that contain critical information such as IP addresses (8.8.8.8). Generally, a client requests a local recursive DNS server to look up the address on its behalf. See  Figure 1 for a visual explanation.

Figure 1. The typical process of how DNS operates

DNS tunneling abuses this legitimate process by creating a covert communication channel that transmits unauthorized data through DNS queries and responses—far beyond DNS’s intended purpose as defined in the RFC specifications. Since DNS traffic is typically allowed through firewalls and often goes unmonitored, attackers exploit this trusted protocol to bypass security controls and establish command-and-control (C2) channels.

Recent threat campaigns have demonstrated the growing sophistication of DNS tunneling attacks, including operations like Decoy Dog, Saitama and DNS Anchor. These real-world examples underscore why DNS tunneling detection and mitigation has become a critical priority for cybersecurity teams.

For a comprehensive explanation of DNS tunneling and a survey of tools we have seen in traffic, see our blog.

Table 1 shows the stark difference between legitimate DNS traffic and DNS tunneling traffic, illustrating how attackers encode data within domain names to create covert communication channels.

This blog presents our machine learning approach to DNS tunnel detection, which introduces two novel feature extraction techniques: CNN autoencoder-derived reconstruction loss and word segmentation analysis. By combining these innovations with traditional DNS traffic features, we achieve state-of-the-art detection performance while maintaining the low false positive rates essential for operational deployment.

We use the logs collected from DNS queries and responses observed below the resolver. This data includes the timestamp, source IP, Query Name (Qname), Query Type (Qtype), Response Code (RCode) and Resource Records. Table 1 shows a small sample set of this data. Table 2 contains a description of the fields we used.

To obtain benign domain data for our classifier, we used DNS logs containing queries from a variety of businesses, internet service providers, schools and other networks. We selected separate one-hour windows over the course of four days. As DNS tunneling is a very rare event, we assume that we will not have any DNS tunneling being performed and the collection represents only benign domains. We also perform two important filtering tasks:

We filter out the top 500 most queried effective second level domains (SLDs), as these account for over 50 percent of all DNS traffic on a typical network. These domains represent trivial classification cases that provide minimal learning value—any reasonable detector would correctly classify them as benign. By excluding these obvious cases, we focus our training on the more challenging boundary cases where the model needs to develop sophisticated discriminative features to distinguish between subtle benign patterns and tunneling traffic.

We removed from the data set the SLDs from a list of known benign DNS tunnels. These include antivirus tools, spam filters and similar tools. In operational deployment, our secondary validation processes are specifically designed to handle and allowlist such legitimate tunneling applications, ensuring they do not trigger false positive alerts.

We also augment our benign dataset with challenging edge cases and adversarial examples that resemble tunneling patterns but are legitimate, ensuring the classifier maintains low false positive rates.

We incorporate hundreds of thousands of DNS tunneling queries representing a comprehensive spectrum of tunneling techniques and evasion strategies. Our malicious dataset encompasses traffic from widely used open-source frameworks including Pupy, DNSCat2, Sliver, Iodine and Cobalt Strike, as well as bespoke custom implementations developed by penetration testers and security researchers. This diverse collection was assembled through multiple acquisition methodologies: deployment of previous detection algorithms in production environments, retrospective analysis of historical network data and controlled sandbox execution of tunneling tools across various operational scenarios. This multi-faceted approach ensures our dataset captures the full range of tunneling behaviors observed in real-world attack scenarios, from common tool signatures to sophisticated custom implementations designed to evade detection.

The final training dataset is balanced between tunneling and benign samples at the query level, following standard data science practices to ensure effective classifier training and unbiased performance evaluation. However, the dataset remains imbalanced at the SLD level, reflecting real-world conditions where blocking decisions are made at the SLD level.

Building upon our dataset preparation and classification approach, we now detail the feature engineering methodology that forms the core of our detection system. The features are extracted at fixed time intervals, grouped by SLD and client IP address in a sliding window. Our feature set combines established metrics from existing literature with two novel contributions that, to the author’s knowledge, have not been previously applied to DNS tunnel detection.

Throughout this post we use “prefix” as terminology for the string portion of a domain name with the SLD removed. In the fictitious example, “abcd123efg.example.com”, “example.com” represents the SLD while “abcd123efg” constitutes the prefix. We focus particularly on prefix analysis since this is where tunneling applications typically encode information for client-to-server communication. Table 3 describes some of the features from our complete set of 20 features, followed by detailed discussion of our two novel techniques for deriving features: autoencoder reconstruction loss extraction and word segmentation analysis.

Autoencoder-Based Feature Extraction

We explore the use of a shallow one-dimensional CNN autoencoder technique to derive reconstruction loss features for our classification model. The autoencoder processes DNS prefixes by first converting each character into numerical embeddings, creating a vector representation of the domain string. For example, the domain prefix “Infoblox” would be transformed into a sequence of character vectors: [“i”, “n”, “f”, “o”, “b”, “l”, “o”, “x”]. The encoder then compresses this sequence into a lower-dimensional latent representation, capturing the essential patterns of the input string. The decoder subsequently attempts to reconstruct the original character sequence from this compressed representation.

We train the autoencoder on a set of 4 million prefixes from non-tunneling domains. The unsupervised model learns to encode strings into a vector space and then reconstruct them, minimizing the reconstruction loss during training. Through this process, the autoencoder learns the typical patterns and structures found in legitimate domain prefixes, such as natural language words, common abbreviations and recognizable naming conventions.

During evaluation, “normal” traffic exhibits low reconstruction loss while tunneling and other “abnormal” traffic produces high reconstruction loss, providing a discriminative feature for classification. Since tunneling prefixes often contain encoded, encrypted or randomly generated data (like “2po3asvtjvfkebjuke4qsvf3ja6agsznrt”), the autoencoder struggles to reconstruct these unfamiliar patterns, resulting in higher loss values that serve as strong indicators of malicious activity.

Initial experiments used Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the loss function. While effective for comparing prefixes of equal length, it performed poorly when comparing prefixes of unequal length. In some cases, this resulted in non-tunneling prefixes having larger reconstruction loss than shorter tunneling domains. We therefore introduced a custom masked MSE (MMSE) loss function which calculates loss only over the non-zero values of the original example. Incorporating the MMSE loss function within our autoencoder architecture reduces sensitivity to varying domain prefix lengths, producing more reliable reconstruction loss features.

Our architecture employs a pair of convolutional layers for encoding and two deconvolutional layers for decoding, with a dropout layer for regularization. Figure 2 shows the kernel density estimates for the reconstruction loss feature across tunnel and non-tunnel domains.

Figure 2. KDE plot for CNN autoencoder reconstruction loss

Word Segmentation-Based Feature Extraction

The majority of legitimate prefixes use natural language words, whereas tunneling prefixes often employ hex, base32 or similar encodings that result in a larger number of word segments. We employ a cost-based word segmentation technique that segments strings into words found in language dictionaries to derive segmentation-based features. For example, the string “facebooksecurity” segments into [“face”, “book”, “security”], while an encoded string such as “youjf34gwid86fih” segments into [“you”, “j”, “f”, “34”, “g”, “w”, “id”, “86”, “f”, “i”, “h”] since no dictionary words match the encoded content.

Using this segmentation technique, we derive multiple features including the ratio of segment count to query name length. We observe that tunneling domains exhibit significantly higher segment-to-length ratios due to their encoded nature—random or encrypted data breaks down into many small, unrecognizable fragments rather than coherent dictionary words. This creates a highly discriminative feature where tunnel prefixes consistently produce much higher ratios compared to legitimate domains.

Table 4 demonstrates this discriminative power through concrete examples. The benign domain “facebooksecurity” achieves a low segment ratio of 0.19 (3 segments/16 characters), while the tunnel prefix “youjf34gwid86can” produces a much higher ratio of 0.69 (11 segments/16 characters). This substantial difference in segment ratios provides a reliable signal for distinguishing between legitimate domain patterns and encoded tunneling data.

Results—Classifier Performance

We evaluated our approach using multiple classification algorithms to establish comprehensive performance baselines. Table 5 presents the performance comparison between Random Forest and Logistic Regression classifiers across both query-level and domain-level metrics.

The Random Forest classifier demonstrates superior performance across all metrics, achieving an F1 score of 99.71 percent at the query level and 96.79 percent at the domain level. While Logistic Regression maintains competitive recall (98.13 percent query-level, 95.42 percent domain-level), it performs with significantly lower precision, particularly at the domain level (34.76 percent), resulting in a substantially lower domain-level F1 score of 50.96 percent.

The domain-level metrics are particularly important for operational deployment, as they reflect the classifier’s ability to correctly identify tunneling domains rather than individual queries. These metrics are calculated by aggregating results at the SLD level: domain-level recall measures the number of unique tunnel SLDs correctly identified divided by the total number of unique tunnel SLDs in the test set, while domain-level precision calculates the number of unique tunnel SLDs correctly identified divided by the total number of unique SLDs flagged as tunnels. This approach provides a more operationally relevant view than query-level metrics, as we typically need to block entire domains rather than individual queries. This is why we are particularly worried about precision, as blocking at the SLD level can add significant risk of blocking a domain that is potentially useful to our customers. The Random Forest’s strong domain-level precision (95 percent) indicates effective reduction of false positive alerts, which is crucial for practical cybersecurity applications. Equally important, the model achieves exceptional domain-level recall (99 percent), demonstrating its ability to detect nearly all tunneling domains with minimal false negatives. This high recall ensures that malicious DNS tunneling activities are rarely missed, providing comprehensive threat coverage.

The emphasis on maximizing recall is strategically designed for our multi-stage detection architecture. In our systems, the primary classifier serves as a comprehensive detection layer that captures potential threats with minimal risk of missing genuine attacks, while subsequent validation processes systematically filter out false positives through additional verification mechanisms and threat intelligence correlation. Additionally, our defense-in-depth approach ensures that any tunnels potentially missed by this classifier can still be detected by our complementary DNS tunnel detection systems, providing multiple layers of protection against evasive tunneling techniques. This approach prioritizes comprehensive threat detection over initial precision, recognizing that missing a genuine DNS tunnel poses significantly greater security risks than flagging legitimate traffic for further analysis. Through these secondary validation stages, the system ensures that false positives are reduced, allowing only likely malicious DNS tunnels to trigger final alerts and automated response actions.

The combination of strong recall and precision scores at the domain level indicate the Random Forest model is capable of performing operational DNS tunnel detection, where maintaining thorough threat coverage while minimizing analyst workload is essential for scalable cybersecurity operations.

Figure 5. Comparison of SLD-level model performance

Evaluation of Novel Features: Measuring Impact Through Feature Removal

To evaluate the contribution of our novel features—autoencoder reconstruction loss and word segmentation ratios—we conducted an ablation study by training the Random Forest classifier with and without these enhancements. This analysis quantifies the direct impact of our proposed features on model performance.

As shown in Figure 6, the removal of novel features results in substantial performance degradation across all metrics. Most notably, SLD-level precision drops significantly from 95 percent to 86 percent when novel features are excluded, while SLD-level recall decreases from 99 percent to 98 percent. The F1 score similarly declines from 97 percent to 92 percent, demonstrating the critical importance of these features for effective tunnel detection.

The precision improvement is particularly significant given our operational context, where the system processes DNS traffic at the scale of billions of events per day. Even a modest increase in precision translates to a substantial reduction in false positive alerts, potentially eliminating thousands of incorrect flags daily. This reduction directly impacts secondary validation tasks and system efficiency, making the novel features essential for practical deployment. Furthermore, the maintained high recall ensures that genuine threats are not missed despite the improved precision, validating the effectiveness of our feature engineering approach.

Figure 6. Impact of novel features on model performance

Real-Time Implementation

In our production platform, we create feature summaries and execute the model in near– real time to process billions of DNS queries daily. Our high-throughput data processing infrastructure enables us to detect potential tunneling activity within seconds of occurrence.

Following the primary detection, secondary validation processes are performed to enhance precision and reduce false positives. These include:

Allowlist Validation: Removing known benign tunneling applications such as antivirus software, security tools and legitimate update mechanisms

Infrastructure Analysis: Examining name servers, registrars and hosting providers associated with flagged SLDs

Behavioral Correlation: Cross-referencing with threat intelligence and historical patterns

The secondary validation layer operates as a scalable microservice architecture, providing resilient processing of flagged domains. After completing both primary detection and secondary validation, the system performs final actions including alerting, blocking or forwarding to security teams for investigation.

[38] Infoblox Blog - DNS Armor Now Generally Available
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Enabling Preemptive Security for Google Cloud Workloads

Last year, Google Cloud announced the public preview of DNS Armor, a cloud-native protective DNS service in partnership with  Infoblox that delivers preemptive threat detection for internet-bound DNS queries initiated from Google Cloud workloads.

Since then, adoption of the service has been rapid. In just the preview phase, hundreds of customers adopted DNS Armor to defend their cloud workloads. During that period, Infoblox has observed the service process more than 22 billion DNS queries and surface over 8.5 million threats, delivering protection at internet scale.

Backed by this strong early customer adoption, DNS Armor is now generally available, and customers can activate it within the Google Cloud console to start protecting their applications and workloads without additional infrastructure or complexity. Whether you’re running workloads on Google Compute Engine, hosting apps on Google Cloud Storage, or deploying Google’s AI and machine learning models, any Google Cloud workload that has an IP and uses Google Cloud’s default DNS resolver to connect to the internet can benefit from the protection offered by DNS Armor.

Cloud Adoption and Why Workload Protection Matters Now More Than Ever

Cloud adoption continues to accelerate as enterprises embrace digital transformation, yet this shift has also placed sensitive applications, data and infrastructure squarely in the crosshairs of attackers. Threat actors target cloud workloads that hold PII, intellectual property, and application code. These threats are also becoming more frequent, sophisticated (ransomware attacks surged by 132% in Q1 ’25 aided by AI deception), and damaging (the global cost of cybercrime is expected to surge to $13.82T by 2028).

Traditional security detects threats after they impact a workload and are no longer sufficient in an era where adversaries use AI to constantly mutate their malicious campaigns. In addition, most tools don’t monitor DNS activities, which provides early warning signals when it comes to detecting potential malicious activity. Finally, managing disparate non-native security solutions to protect cloud workloads adds complexity.

For years, cybersecurity strategies have been built around a simple “patient zero” model. A new attack hits an organization (also known as “patient zero”), the rest of the industry learns how it works, and then updates are made to security tools to protect other organizations. This reactive model largely worked in a pre-AI world, where attackers reused malware, attack techniques and domains long enough for security clouds to learn, share indicators, and protect everyone else after the first victim.

That assumption is now broken.

AI has fundamentally changed the economics and execution of cyberattacks. Threat actors are using AI to automate reconnaissance, generate single-use malware, personalize attacks at scale, and continuously mutate campaigns. In this new reality, every organization is effectively “patient zero.” In fact, 95% of the 25 million domains classified as malicious by Infoblox in a single year were seen at only one enterprise, highlighting how single-use infrastructure has become the norm where domains are weaponized and then disappear.

To combat this shifting threat landscape, security must become preemptive, stopping AI-driven attacks, no matter how many times they evolve and mutate.

DNS Armor Delivers Preemptive Security

DNS Armor brings Infoblox-enabled predictive threat intelligence and analytics directly into Google Cloud, enabling enterprises to secure their cloud workloads with a scalable, easy-to-manage service.

DNS Armor analyzes DNS queries in real time and uses both threat intelligence feeds and algorithmic detection to identify malicious activity before it can impact workloads. This includes:

Blocking DNS queries to known malicious domains

Detecting newly registered domains likely to be weaponized

Identifying DNS tunneling used for data exfiltration

[39] Infoblox Blog - Compromised Routers, DNS, and a TDS Hidden in Aeza Networks
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Tue, 03 Feb 2026 15:55:59 +0000

[TAM METİN - 1880 kelime]
When most people say DNS, they are thinking about the global DNS system, the official mechanism for resolving domain names on the internet. But shadow systems exist. Visiting a website relies on a DNS resolution chain that iteratively queries authoritative name servers within the distributed DNS hierarchy to get an IP address. This resolution all happens in the background, and users put a lot of trust into DNS resolvers without even realizing they exist. If the IP address of those resolvers is changed, a website’s domain name might resolve to an entirely different IP address, sending an unwitting visitor to an entirely different location.

We discovered compromised routers whose DNS settings had been changed to use shadow resolvers hosted in Aeza International (AS210644), a bulletproof hosting company (BPH) sanctioned by the U.S. Government in July 2025. The DNS change meant that every device behind that router was serviced not by the local ISP’s DNS resolvers, but by the threat actor. The Aeza resolvers selectively altered the responses, allowing them to direct users to a range of malicious content, all through a DNS resolution. This shadow network also incorporates an HTTP-based traffic distribution system (TDS), further allowing the actor to fingerprint users and funnel them to content of the actor’s choosing. The combination of an alternate DNS and TDS, along with a clever DNS trick to prevent probing by security groups, has allowed the actor to remain undetected for years. Figure 1 provides a high-level overview of how the system works.

Figure 1. An overview of the two-part TDS hosted in Aeza International

This system appears to be operated by a financially motivated actor in the affiliate marketing space. Since mid-2022, they have directed user traffic to adtech platforms through “smartlinks,” a mechanism used in affiliate advertising to fingerprint a device and redirect the user to “advertising” content. The links contain unregistered domains and require interaction with one of the shadow DNS servers to resolve. We use quotes here for advertising because often this content is malware or scams.

While the actor’s verified activity is affiliate marketing, they could have interfered in other ways with devices in the network. As a trusted source, they could alter DNS records for any domain and run adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) operations, not just for websites, but for the domain names of critical applications and services.

We cannot emphasize this enough: the DNS resolver is in a position of power.

The threat actor compromises routers, particularly older models, and changes the DNS settings on them. Every device using that router will unwittingly use the shadow DNS network.

One user described their experience in early 2025 in a Reddit post titled “HELP im going insane” [sic].  In a now-deleted response, another user describes their own experience, which hints that the exploitation goes beyond the router exploitation that we verified; see Figure 2. This threat is deceiving and will lead to the assumption that a problem exists in other services: online users complained that they could not access Google Sheets or that they were regularly redirected when using Google Chrome. These user reports indicate that the threat actor has manipulated DNS in some cases where we would expect the encrypted DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) to be used and the router-set DNS server to be ignored. It’s possible that in these cases, the user has turned off the secure DNS option or there is another underlying compromise on the device; we don’t know.

Figure 2. A Reddit response to a user post about being unable to use their home network without interference; this response and the original question are now deleted but were online in November 2025.

There are dozens of recursive resolvers in the shadow Aeza network. Each compromised router is assigned a pair of them for DNS resolution. Answers to queries contain a time-to-live (TTL) of 20 seconds, forcing the devices to regularly connect to the Aeza resolver and ensuring that malicious redirects are difficult to replicate.

The threat actor modifies responses based on the domain name requested, the router’s location, time between queries from the router, and randomization. Extremely popular domains such as Google or Facebook are, in our experience, usually answered truthfully. Others that are still popular or related to critical services may be modified. For example, we have seen altered responses for domains like shopify[.]com and okta[.]com. The resolvers will also answer queries for non-existent domains, which are often seen because of typos or as leaks from devices on a network for local domains.

Answers from the resolvers change based on several factors, and the correct IP address is frequently returned so that malicious redirects are limited and unpredictable. If any of the resolvers are queried “too often” in a short period of time, they will return 255.255.255.255 to the query. The reason for this response in lieu of the correct resolution is unclear to us.

The DNS portion of the TDS uses a surprising trick to hide from security testing: it only answers DNS queries with a specific format. For example, if you query one of the name servers, e.g., 89.208.105.113, for the IP address of shopify[.]com, under most conditions you will get an error:

;; Warning: Message parser reports malformed message packet.

This stumped us for months. We knew that the queries were resolving for some devices but couldn’t trigger a response ourselves. Persistent tinkering led to a solution! If we sent a query without the Extension Mechanisms for DNS (EDNS0) included, voila! The name server replied.

This restriction by the threat actor is surprising because EDNS0 was introduced over a decade ago and is part of a standard DNS implementation. As a protocol extension, EDNS0 can serve a variety of purposes, including increasing the accepted size of a response, supporting DNSSEC, and providing hints about the client device location. Because most DNS resolvers enable EDNS0, queries to the Aeza hosts will usually result in a malformed response.

Here is how to trigger a response from the command line:

dig +noedns @89.208.105.113 shopify.com

After building signatures, we found over three dozen resolvers for the system in early November 2025.  Some of those IP addresses include: 104[.]238[.]29[.]136, 138[.]124[.]101[.]153, 193[.]233[.]232[.]229, 45[.]80[.]228[.]233, 89[.]208[.]103[.]145.

Thus far, we have only triggered a response by disabling EDNS0, but we suspect there is more to be learned. The number of routers that don’t use EDNS0 is dwindling and would seem to limit their operation. Additionally, from one of our research partners, we know that the threat actor is broadly and regularly searching for new routers to attack. So, why keep this restriction? But….

Getting the DNS resolvers to respond is only the first piece of this puzzle….

When a user’s browser connects to the altered IP address, e.g., 147.45.69.3, the device is fingerprinted and then directed to the next stage of the TDS if it passes the initial checks. This IP address serves as a proxy for the HTTP TDS, see Figure 3 for the host posture. Upon connection, a JavaScript file is returned that includes additional DNS queries which ensure that the connecting device is behind a compromised router. This is accomplished by including a URL with a domain name that should not resolve, e.g., gettranslate[.]ir. If the domain does not resolve, the script will redirect the user to www[.]google[.]com.

Figure 3. Host posture of TDS proxy (147.45.69.3) returned by the shadow DNS servers as of January 21, 2026

The script we analyzed contained seemingly old code, including URLs hosted on domains that were apparently never registered. See Figure 4. The purposes of the various functions re(), red(), redbo(), etc., are unknown. If the device is unable to resolve gettranslate[.]ir and connect on port 18443, it will do a refresh and load Google’s primary landing page. We have uncovered other versions of the scripts which use a different .ir domain.

Figure 4. Malicious script received in November 2025 through the Aeza TDS showing historical code using links on unregistered domains; the current function redbool() will attempt to connect to gettranslate[.]ir on port 18443.

If the first connection is successful, the device will be redirected again to another affiliate marketing platform link. From the URL

http://gettranslate[.]ir:18443/baner?sig=ded8deb7ff580788cc58cbbf5508f3bf&BanerId=347333

we were redirected to an adtech TDS that we track via

www.effectivegatecpm[.]com/bag4ni13i?key=cef13d2e5a9d1e200a50a6b3834cc7a9

From there, our traffic was resold and eventually we were shown various advertisements. But with all these checks in place to ensure the traffic is coming from the compromised routers, our browser would frequently end up at the requested site or redirected to Google.

We have found instances where directly visiting the TDS IP address resulted in an immediate redirection to a smartlink. For example, in the past, connecting to 89.208.107.49:8081 redirected to a smartlink using jackpotshop[.]life hosted in AS6898.

For reasons that are unclear, portions of the script were injected into comments in online forums, as well.

In our research, the TDS always forced the browser into one of the two adtech platforms. But it is possible the threat actor is doing more with this system; the Reddit thread we uncovered indicated that bitcoin miners were installed and the admin was locked out.

While not overly sophisticated, the design of this TDS is clever and has a reasonable amount of infrastructure to maintain just to deliver unwanted advertising. And it’s clearly worked—this actor has operated undetected for years.

The Aeza shadow TDS we discovered harkens back to the days of DNSChanger malware, which was the work of an Estonian company. Distributed as software necessary to view videos on websites, the malware changed DNS configurations and served advertising content from the company. The FBI seized the C2 servers and indicted key figures in 2011.

Controlling DNS resolution is extremely powerful and goes well beyond the ability to deliver ads to a user. For example, a threat actor can selectively answer queries for critical services that are not protected by SSL certificates, or they can deny access to resources. The DNSChanger malware prevented antivirus updates on infected machines as a means of persistence.

More recently, ESET Research published findings on a Chinese actor who had tampered with DNS resolver settings and targeted software updates. The ability to determine when software is updated and to deliver modified updates can allow lateral movement within a network. Beyond these examples, DNS is used to discover services, check systems, establish trust, and connect to resources for every aspect of internet communication.

Overlay networks like this one can also impact DNS research because the false records get absorbed into some databases. There are many commercial sources for passive DNS available and some of these rely on “port 53” collection. In these cases, responses from authoritative name servers within the global DNS are mixed with the responses from alternate resolvers like the ones we’ve described here. If researchers aren’t aware of the type of DNS data they are using, they can draw false conclusions.

In our case, a third-party “port 53” collection helped us recognize this overlay network. There were Kimwolf botnet domains in that database, which resolved incorrectly to 89[.]208[.]107[.]49, an IP address we had already been monitoring for a few years. Independently, we had been “noodling” over mysterious DNS resolutions for domains like gettranslate[.]ir. Suddenly, we were able to put these two puzzles together and once we had the EDNS0 trick, the mystery quickly unraveled. How fun is that?
