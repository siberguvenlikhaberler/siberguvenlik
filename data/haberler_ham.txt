A Russian-speaking, financially motivated threat actor has been observed taking advantage of commercial generative artificial intelligence (AI) services to compromise over 600 FortiGate devices located in 55 countries.

That's according to new findings from Amazon Threat Intelligence, which said it observed the activity between January 11 and February 18, 2026.

"No exploitation of FortiGate vulnerabilities was observed—instead, this campaign succeeded by exploiting exposed management ports and weak credentials with single-factor authentication, fundamental security gaps that AI helped an unsophisticated actor exploit at scale," CJ Moses, Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) of Amazon Integrated Security, said in a report.

The tech giant described the threat actor as having limited technical capabilities, a constraint they overcame by relying on multiple commercial generative AI tools to implement various phases of the attack cycle, such as tool development, attack planning, and command generation.

While one AI tool served as the primary backbone of the operation, the attackers also relied on a second AI tool as a fallback to assist with pivoting within a specific compromised network. The names of the AI tools were not disclosed.

The threat actor is assessed to be driven by financial gain and not associated with any advanced persistent threat (APT) with state-sponsored resources. As recently highlighted by Google, generative AI tools are being increasingly adopted by threat actors to scale and accelerate their operations, even if they don't equip them with novel uses of the technology.

If anything, the emergence of AI tools illustrates how capabilities that were once off-limits to novice or technically challenged threat actors are becoming increasingly feasible, further lowering the barrier to entry for cybercrime and enabling them to come up with attack methodologies.

"They are likely a financially motivated individual or small group who, through AI augmentation, achieved an operational scale that would have previously required a significantly larger and more skilled team," Moses said.

Amazon's investigation into the threat actor's activity has revealed that they have successfully compromised multiple organizations’ Active Directory environments, extracted complete credential databases, and even targeted backup infrastructure, likely in a lead-up to ransomware deployment.

What's interesting here is that rather than devising ways to persist within hardened environments or those that had employed sophisticated security controls, the threat actor chose to drop the target altogether and move to a relatively softer victim. This indicates the use of AI as a way to bridge their skill gap for easy pickings.

Amazon said it identified publicly accessible infrastructure managed by the attackers that hosted various artifacts pertinent to the campaign. This included AI-generated attack plans, victim configurations, and source code for custom tooling. The entire modus operandi is akin to an "AI-powered assembly line for cybercrime," the company added.

At its core, the attacks enabled the threat actor to breach FortiGate appliances, allowing it to extract full device configurations that, in turn, made it possible to glean credentials, network topology information, and device configuration information.

This involved systematic scanning of FortiGate management interfaces exposed to the internet across ports 443, 8443, 10443, and 4443, followed by attempts to authenticate using commonly reused credentials. The activity was sector-agnostic, indicating automated mass scanning for vulnerable appliances. The scans originated from the IP address 212.11.64[.]250.

The stolen data was then used to burrow deeper into targeted networks and conduct post-exploitation activities, including reconnaissance for vulnerability scanning using Nuclei, Active Directory compromise, credential harvesting, and efforts to access backup infrastructure that align with typical ransomware operations.

Data gathered by Amazon shows that the scanning activity resulted in organizational-level compromise, causing multiple FortiGate devices belonging to the same entity to be accessed. The compromised clusters have been detected across South Asia, Latin America, the Caribbean, West Africa, Northern Europe, and Southeast Asia.

"Following VPN access to victim networks, the threat actor deploys a custom reconnaissance tool, with different versions written in both Go and Python," the company said.

"Analysis of the source code reveals clear indicators of AI-assisted development: redundant comments that merely restate function names, simplistic architecture with disproportionate investment in formatting over functionality, naive JSON parsing via string matching rather than proper deserialization, and compatibility shims for language built-ins with empty documentation stubs."

Some of the other steps undertaken by the threat actor following the reconnaissance phase are listed below -

Achieve domain compromise via DCSync attacks.

Move laterally across the network via pass-the-hash/pass-the-ticket attacks, NTLM relay attacks, and remote command execution on Windows hosts.

Target Veeam Backup & Replication servers to deploy credential harvesting tools and programs aimed at exploiting known Veeam vulnerabilities (e.g., CVE-2023-27532 and CVE-2024-40711).

Another noteworthy finding is the threat actor's pattern of repeatedly running into failures when trying to exploit anything beyond the "most straightforward, automated attack paths," with their own documentation recording that the targets had either patched the services, closed the required ports, or had no vulnerable exploitation vectors.

With Fortinet appliances becoming an attractive target for threat actors, it's essential that organizations ensure management interfaces are not exposed to the internet, change default and common credentials, rotate SSL-VPN user credentials, implement multi-factor authentication for administrative and VPN access, and audit for unauthorized administrative accounts or connections.

It's also essential to isolate backup servers from general network access, ensure all software programs are up-to-date, and monitor for unintended network exposure.

"As we expect this trend to continue in 2026, organizations should anticipate that AI-augmented threat activity will continue to grow in volume from both skilled and unskilled adversaries," Moses said. "Strong defensive fundamentals remain the most effective countermeasure: patch management for perimeter devices, credential hygiene, network segmentation, and robust detection for post-exploitation indicators."

[2] The Hacker News - Anthropic Launches Claude Code Security for AI-Powered Vulnerability Scanning
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[TAM METİN - 351 kelime]
Artificial intelligence (AI) company Anthropic has begun to roll out a new security feature for Claude Code that can scan a user's software codebase for vulnerabilities and suggest patches.

The capability, called Claude Code Security, is currently available in a limited research preview to Enterprise and Team customers.

"It scans codebases for security vulnerabilities and suggests targeted software patches for human review, allowing teams to find and fix security issues that traditional methods often miss," the company said in a Friday announcement.

Anthropic said the feature aims to leverage AI as a tool to help find and resolve vulnerabilities to counter attacks where threat actors weaponize the same tools to automate vulnerability discovery.

With AI agents increasingly capable of detecting security vulnerabilities that have otherwise escaped human notice, the tech upstart said the same capabilities could be used by adversaries to uncover exploitable weaknesses more quickly than before. Claude Code Security, it added, is designed to counter this kind of AI-enabled attack by giving defenders an advantage and improving the security baseline.

Anthropic claimed that Claude Code Security goes beyond static analysis and scanning for known patterns by reasoning the codebase like a human security researcher, as well as understanding how various components interact, tracing data flows throughout the application, and flagging vulnerabilities that may be missed by rule-based tools.

Each of the identified vulnerabilities is then subjected to what it says is a "multi-stage verification process" where the results are re-analyzed to filter out false positives. The vulnerabilities are also assigned a severity rating to help teams focus on the most important ones.

The final results are displayed to the analyst in the Claude Code Security dashboard, where teams can review the code and the suggested patches and approve them. Anthropic also emphasized that the system's decision-making is driven by a human-in-the-loop (HITL) approach.

"Because these issues often involve nuances that are difficult to assess from source code alone, Claude also provides a confidence rating for each finding," Anthropic said. "Nothing is applied without human approval: Claude Code Security identifies problems and suggests solutions, but developers always make the call."

[TAM METİN - 227 kelime]
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) on Friday added two security flaws impacting Roundcube webmail software to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, citing evidence of active exploitation.

The vulnerabilities in question are listed below -

CVE-2025-49113 (CVSS score: 9.9) - A deserialization of untrusted data vulnerability that allows remote code execution by authenticated users because the _from parameter in a URL is not validated in program/actions/settings/upload.php. (Fixed in June 2025)

CVE-2025-68461 (CVSS score: 7.2) - A cross-site scripting vulnerability via the animate tag in an SVG document. (Fixed in December 2025)

Dubai-based cybersecurity company FearsOff, whose founder and CEO, Kirill Firsov, was credited with discovering and reporting CVE-2025-49113, said attackers have already "diffed and weaponized the vulnerability" within 48 hours of public disclosure of the flaw. An exploit for the vulnerability was subsequently made available for sale on June 4, 2025.

Firsov also noted that the shortcoming can be triggered reliably on default installations, and that it had been hidden in the codebase for over 10 years.

There are no details on who is behind the exploitation of the two Roundcube flaws. But multiple vulnerabilities in the email software have been weaponized by nation-state threat actors like APT28 and Winter Vivern.

Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies are to remediate identified vulnerabilities by March 13, 2026, to secure their networks against the active threat.

[4] The Hacker News - EC-Council Expands AI Certification Portfolio to Strengthen U.S. AI Workforce Readiness and Security
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[TAM METİN - 800 kelime]
With $5.5 trillion in global AI risk exposure and 700,000 U.S. workers needing reskilling, four new AI certifications and Certified CISO v4 help close the gap between AI adoption and workforce readiness.

EC-Council, creator of the world-renowned Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) credential and a global leader in applied cybersecurity education, today launched its Enterprise AI Credential Suite, with four new role-based AI certifications debuting alongside Certified CISO v4, an overhauled executive cyber leadership program. The dual launch is the largest single expansion of EC-Council’s portfolio in its 25-year history. It addresses a structural gap that no single tool, platform, or policy can solve alone: AI is scaling faster than the workforce trained to run, secure, and govern it.

The launch aligns with U.S. priorities on workforce development and applied AI education outlined in Executive Order 14179, the July 2025 AI Action Plan’s workforce development pillar, and Executive Orders 14277 and 14278, which emphasize expanding AI education pathways and building job-relevant skills across professional and skilled-trade roles, at a time when organizations are moving AI from pilot projects into everyday operations and decision-making.

That urgency is visible in both economic exposure and workforce capacity. IDC estimates that unmanaged AI risk could reach $5.5 trillion globally, while Bain & Company projects a 700,000-person AI and cybersecurity reskilling gap in the United States. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Economic Forum (WEF) have also pointed to workforce readiness, rather than access to technology, as a primary constraint on AI-driven productivity and growth, especially as adoption accelerates across sectors.

Security pressure is rising in parallel with adoption. Eighty-seven percent of organizations report AI-driven attacks, and generative AI traffic has surged by 890 percent, expanding attack surfaces that many teams are still learning how to defend, while AI capability remains concentrated, with 67 percent of AI talent located in just 15 U.S. cities and women representing only 28 percent of the AI workforce, highlighting persistent access and participation gaps as demand increases.

“AI is moving from experimentation to infrastructure, and the workforce has to move with it,” said Jay Bavisi, Group President, EC-Council. “These programs are built to give professionals practical capability across adoption, security, and governance, so organizations can scale AI with confidence and clear accountability.”

Role-Aligned Certifications

The Enterprise AI Credential Suite is structured to mirror how AI capability is developed in practice. Artificial Intelligence Essentials (AIE) serves as the baseline, building practical AI fluency and responsible usage across roles, and it is supported by EC-Council’s proprietary Adopt. Defend. Govern. (ADG) framework, which defines how AI should be operationalized at scale in real environments.

Adopt: Prepare teams to deploy AI deliberately, with readiness and safeguards

Defend: Secure AI systems against threats such as prompt injection, data poisoning, model exploitation, and AI supply-chain compromise

Govern: Embed accountability, oversight, and risk management into AI systems from the outset

Within this structure, the four new certifications align directly to specific workforce needs across the AI lifecycle.

Artificial Intelligence Essentials (AIE) builds foundational AI literacy.

Certified AI Program Manager (CAIPM) equips to translate AI strategy into execution, aligning teams, governance, and delivery to drive measurable ROI and enterprise-scale intelligence.

Certified Offensive AI Security Professional (COASP) builds elite capabilities to test vulnerabilities in LLMs, simulate exploits, and secure AI infrastructure hardening enterprises against emerging threats.

Certified Responsible AI Governance & Ethics (CRAGE) credential focuses on Responsible AI, Governance and Ethics at enterprise scale with NIST/ISO compliance.

Alongside the new AI certifications, Certified CISO v4 updates executive cyber leadership education for AI-driven risk environments, strengthening leadership readiness as intelligent systems become part of core business operations and security decision-making.

“Security leaders are now accountable for systems that learn, adapt, and influence outcomes at speed,” Bavisi added. “Certified CISO v4 prepares leaders to manage AI-driven risk with clarity, strengthen governance, and make informed decisions when responsibility is on the line.”

The portfolio also builds on EC-Council’s long-standing work with government and defense organizations, including its existing DoD 8140 baseline certification recognition, as AI security and workforce readiness take on greater national importance.

[5] BleepingComputer - Predator spyware hooks iOS SpringBoard to hide mic, camera activity
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Sat, 21 Feb 2026 11:13:24 -0500
Link: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/predator-spyware-hooks-ios-springboard-to-hide-mic-camera-activity/

[TAM METİN - 554 kelime]
Intellexa’s Predator spyware can hide iOS recording indicators while secretly streaming camera and microphone feeds to its operators.

The malware does not exploit any iOS vulnerability but leverages previously obtained kernel-level access to hijack system indicators that would otherwise expose its surveillance operation.

Apple introduced recording indicators on the status bar in iOS 14 to alert users when the camera or microphone is in use, displaying a green or an orange dot, respectively.

US-sanctioned surveillance firm Intellexa developed the Predator commercial spyware and delivered it in attacks that exploited Apple and Chrome zero-day flaws and through 0-click infection mechanisms.

While its ability to suppress camera and microphone activity indicators is well known, it was unclear how the mechanism worked.

How Predator hides recording

Researchers at mobile device management company Jamf analyzed Predator samples and documented the process of hiding the privacy-related indicators.

According to Jamf, Predator hides all recording indicators on iOS 14 by using a single hook function (‘HiddenDot::setupHook()’) inside SpringBoard, invoking the method whenever sensor activity changes (upon camera or microphone activation).

By intercepting it, Predator prevents sensor activity updates from ever reaching the UI layer, so the green or red dot never lights up.

“The target method _handleNewDomainData: is called by iOS whenever sensor activity changes - camera turns on, microphone activates, etc.,” Jamf researchers explain.

“By hooking this single method, Predator intercepts ALL sensor status updates before they reach the indicator display system.”

The hook works by nullifying the object responsible for sensor updates (SBSensorActivityDataProvider in SpringBoard). In Objective-C, calls to a null object are silently ignored, so SpringBoard never processes the camera or microphone activation, and no indicator appears.

Because SBSensorActivityDataProvider aggregates all sensor activity, this single hook disables both the camera and the microphone indicators.

The researchers also found “dead code” that attempted to hook ‘SBRecordingIndicatorManager’ directly. However, it doesn’t execute, and is likely an earlier development path that was abandoned in favor of the better approach that intercepts sensor data upstream.

In the case of VoIP recordings, which Predator also supports, the module responsible lacks an indicator-suppression mechanism, so it relies on the HiddenDot function for stealth.

Jamf further explains that camera access is enabled through a separate module that locates internal camera functions using ARM64 instruction pattern matching and Pointer Authentication Code (PAC) redirection to bypass camera permission checks.

Without indicators lighting up on the status bar, the spyware activity remains completely hidden to the regular user.

Jamf notes that technical analysis reveals the signs of the malicious processes, such as unexpected memory mappings or exception ports in SpringBoard and mediaserverd, breakpoint-based hooks, and audio files written by mediaserverd to unusual paths.

BleepingComputer has contacted Apple with a request for a comment on Jamf’s findings, but the company never responded.

[6] BleepingComputer - Amazon: AI-assisted hacker breached 600 Fortinet firewalls in 5 weeks
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Sat, 21 Feb 2026 08:50:58 -0500
Link: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/amazon-ai-assisted-hacker-breached-600-fortigate-firewalls-in-5-weeks/

[TAM METİN - 1369 kelime]
Article updated at the bottom with additional technical details about this campaign.

Amazon is warning that a Russian-speaking hacker used multiple generative AI services as part of a campaign that breached more than 600 FortiGate firewalls across 55 countries in five weeks.

A new report by CJ Moses, CISO of Amazon Integrated Security, says that the hacking campaign occurred between January 11 and February 18, 2026, and did not rely on any exploits to breach Fortinet firewalls.

Instead, the threat actor targeted exposed management interfaces and weak credentials that lacked MFA protection, then used AI to help automate access to other devices on the breached network.

Moses says the compromised firewalls were observed across South Asia, Latin America, the Caribbean, West Africa, Northern Europe, and Southeast Asia, among other regions.

An AI-powered hacking campaign

Amazon says it learned about the campaign after finding a server hosting malicious tools used to target Fortinet FortiGate firewalls.

As part of the campaign, the threat actor targeted FortiGate management interfaces exposed to the internet by scanning for services running on ports 443, 8443, 10443, and 4443. The targeting was reportedly opportunistic rather than against any specific industries.

Rather than exploiting zero-days, as we commonly see targeting FortiGate devices, the actor used brute-force attacks with common passwords to gain access to devices.

Once breached, the threat actor extracted the device's configuration settings, which include:

SSL-VPN user credentials with recoverable passwords

Administrative credentials

Firewall policies and internal network architecture

IPsec VPN configurations

Network topology and routing information

These configuration files were then parsed and decrypted using what appears to be AI-assisted Python and Go tools.

"Following VPN access to victim networks, the threat actor deploys a custom reconnaissance tool, with different versions written in both Go and Python," explained Amazon.

"Analysis of the source code reveals clear indicators of AI-assisted development: redundant comments that merely restate function names, simplistic architecture with disproportionate investment in formatting over functionality, naive JSON parsing via string matching rather than proper deserialization, and compatibility shims for language built-ins with empty documentation stubs."

"While functional for the threat actor's specific use case, the tooling lacks robustness and fails under edge cases—characteristics typical of AI-generated code used without significant refinement."

These tools were used to automate reconnaissance on the breached networks by analyzing routing tables, classifying networks by size, running port scans using the open-source gogo scanner, identifying SMB hosts and domain controllers, and using Nuclei to look for HTTP services.

The researchers say that while the tools were functional, they commonly failed in more hardened environments.

Operational documentation written in Russian detailed how to use Meterpreter and mimikatz to conduct DCSync attacks against Windows domain controllers and extract NTLM password hashes from the Active Directory database.

The campaign also specifically targeted Veeam Backup & Replication servers using custom PowerShell scripts, compiled credential-extraction tools, and attempted to exploit Veeam vulnerabilities.

On one of the servers found by Amazon (212[.]11.64.250), the threat actor hosted a PowerShell script named "DecryptVeeamPasswords.ps1" that was used to target the backup application.

As Amazon explains, threat actors often target backup infrastructure before deploying ransomware to prevent the restoration of encrypted files from backups.

The threat actors' "operational notes" also contained multiple references to trying to exploit various vulnerabilities, including CVE-2019-7192 (QNAP RCE), CVE-2023-27532 (Veeam information disclosure), and CVE-2024-40711 (Veeam RCE).

The report says that the attacker repeatedly failed when attempting to breach patched or locked-down systems, but instead of continuing to try to gain access, they moved on to easier targets.

While Amazon believes the threat actor has a low-to-medium skill set, that skill set was greatly amplified through the use of AI.

The researchers say the threat actor utilized at least two large language model providers throughout the campaign to:

Generate step-by-step attack methodologies

Develop custom scripts in multiple programming languages

Create reconnaissance frameworks

Plan lateral movement strategies

Draft operational documentation

In one instance, the actor reportedly submitted a full internal victim network topology, including IP addresses, hostnames, credentials, and known services, to an AI service and asked for help spreading further into the network.

Amazon says the campaign demonstrates how commercial AI services are lowering the barrier to entry for threat actors, enabling them to carry out attacks that would normally be outside their skill set.

The company recommends that FortiGate admins not expose management interfaces to the internet, ensure MFA is enabled, ensure VPN passwords are not the same as those for Active Directory accounts, and harden backup infrastructure.

Google recently reported that threat actors are abusing Gemini AI across all stages of cyberattacks, mirroring what Amazon observed in this campaign.

Custom AI toolset powers breaches

Separate research published yesterday on the Cyber and Ramen security blog provides additional technical details about how AI and large language models were incorporated directly into the intrusion campaign.

The researcher shared that the misconfigured server at 212.11.64[.]250, also found by Amazon, exposed 1,402 files, including stolen FortiGate configuration backups, Active Directory mapping data, credential dumps, vulnerability assessments, and attack planning documents.

"The server at 212.11.64[.]250:9999, hosted on AS4264 (Global-Data System IT Corporation, Zurich, Switzerland), contained 1,402 files across 139 subdirectories," explained the threat researcher.

"Folders within the directory included CVE exploit code, FortiGate configuration files, Nuclei scanning templates and Veeam credential extraction tools. Two folders named claude-0 and claude contained over 200 files between the two, including Claude Code task outputs, session diffs, and cached prompt states."

"A folder titled fortigate_27.123(full IP redacted) held configuration data and credentials from what appeared to be a compromised FortiGate appliance."

Included in the exposed files was a custom Model Context Protocol (MCP) server named ARXON, which acted as a bridge between reconnaissance data and commercial large language models. The researcher said they were unable to find any public references to ARXON, indicating it was likely a custom MCP framework created by the threat actor.

An MCP server acts as an intermediary layer that ingests data, feeds it into language models, and then uses the generated output with other tools. In this campaign, the ingested data was used to automate post-compromise analysis and attack planning.

A separate Go tool called CHECKER2 is a Docker-based orchestrator that was used to scan thousands of VPN targets in parallel, with logs showing more than 2,500 potential targets across 100+ countries.

According to the researcher, reconnaissance data collected from compromised FortiGate appliances and internal networks was fed into ARXON, which then queried large language models such as DeepSeek and Claude to generate structured attack plans.

These attack plans included instructions for gaining Domain Admin, suggested locations to search for credentials, recommended exploitation steps, and guidance on spreading laterally to other devices.

In some cases, Claude Code was configured to execute offensive tools on its own, including Impacket scripts, Metasploit modules, and hashcat, without requiring the threat actor to approve each command.

The researcher notes that the operation evolved over several weeks, with the attacker initially using an open-source HexStrike MCP framework and, about eight weeks later, moving to the automated, customized ARXON system.

This report shares Amazon's assessment that generative AI is being used as a multiplier, allowing attackers to scale intrusions more efficiently. The researcher similarly warns that defenders should prioritize patching edge devices and auditing unusual SSH activity and VPN account creation.

CronUp security researcher Germán Fernández also found a different server exposing a directory containing what appear to be AI-generated tools targeting FortiWeb.

While these tools do not appear to be part of the FortiGate campaign, they once again show how threat actors are continuing to use AI tools to power their attacks.

Update 2/21/26: Added more technical details from Cyber and Ramen security blog and Germán Fernández.

[TAM METİN - 336 kelime]
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) added two RoundCube Webmail flaws to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog.

Roundcube is a popular webmail platform and has been repeatedly targeted by advanced threat groups like APT28 and Winter Vivern. In the past, attackers exploited these vulnerabilities to steal login credentials and spy on sensitive communications. These campaigns show how unpatched systems remain a serious risk, especially for high-value targets.

The critical flaw CVE-2025-49113 is a deserialization of untrusted data vulnerability. The flaw went unnoticed for over a decade, an attacker can exploit it to take control of affected systems and run malicious code, putting users and organizations at significant risk. Kirill Firsov, founder and CEO of FearsOff, discovered the vulnerability.

“Roundcube Webmail before 1.5.10 and 1.6.x before 1.6.11 allows remote code execution by authenticated users because the _from parameter in a URL is not validated in program/actions/settings/upload.php, leading to PHP Object Deserialization.” reads the advisory published by NIST.

The vulnerability has been addressed in 1.6.11 and 1.5.10 LTS.

At the time of the discovery, Firsov estimated that the flaw was impacting over 53 million hosts (and tools like cPanel, Plesk, ISPConfig, DirectAdmin, etc.),

Researchers at Positive Technologies announced they have reproduced CVE-2025-49113 in Roundcube. The experts urge users to update to the latest version of Roundcube immediately.

The second flaw, tracked as CVE-2025-68461, added to the Kev catalog is a cross-site scripting vulnerability.

“Roundcube Webmail before 1.5.12 and 1.6 before 1.6.12 is prone to a Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS) vulnerability via the animate tag in an SVG document.” reads the advisory.

According to Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities, FCEB agencies have to address the identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect their networks against attacks exploiting the flaws in the catalog.

Experts also recommend that private organizations review the Catalog and address the vulnerabilities in their infrastructure.

CISA orders federal agencies to fix the vulnerabilities by March 10, 2026.

Wikipedia editors have decided to remove all links to Archive.today, a web archiving service that they said has been linked to more than 695,000 times across the online encyclopedia.

Archive.today — which also operates under several other domain names, including archive.is and archive.ph — is perhaps most widely used to access content that’s otherwise inaccessible behind paywalls. That also makes it useful as a source for Wikipedia citations.

However, according to the Wikipedia discussion page about this topic, “There is consensus to immediately deprecate archive.today, and, as soon as practicable, add it to the spam blacklist […] and to forthwith remove all links to it.” (Ars Technica first reported on the decision.)

The discussion page says that Archive.today was previously blacklisted in 2013, only to be removed from the blacklist in 2016.

Why reverse course again? Because, the discussion page says, “Wikipedia should not direct its readers towards a website that hijacks users’ computers to run a DDoS attack.” Plus, “evidence has been presented that archive.today’s operators have altered the content of archived pages, rendering it unreliable.”

The distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack in question was allegedly directed at blogger Jani Patokallio. Patokallio wrote that beginning on January 11, users who loaded the archive’s CAPTCHA page have been unknowingly loading and executing JavaScript that sends a search request to his Gyrovague blog, in an apparent attempt to get Patokallio’s attention and increase his hosting bill.

Back in 2023, Patokallio published a blog post examining Archive.today, whose ownership he described as “an opaque mystery.” And while he wasn’t able to track down a specific owner, he concluded the site was likely “a one-person labor of love, operated by a Russian of considerable talent and access to Europe.”

More recently, Patokallio said the webmaster at Archive.today asked him to take the post down for two or three months.

“I do not mind the post, but the issue is: journos from mainstream media (Heise, Verge, etc) cherry-pick just a couple of words from your blog, and then construct very different narratives having your post the only citable source; then they cite each other and produce a shitty result to present for a wide audience,” the webmaster said, according to emails shared by Patokallio.

Patokallio said that after he declined to take the post down, the webmaster responded with “an increasingly unhinged series of threats.”

Wikipedia editors also pointed to webpage snapshots in Archive.today that appeared to have been altered to insert Patokallio’s name — hence the concern that it’s become “unreliable” as an archive.

Wikipedia’s guidance now calls for editors to remove links to Archive.today and related sites, replacing them with links to the original source or to other archives like the Wayback Machine.

On a blog linked from the Archive.today website, the site’s apparent owner wrote that Archive.today’s value to Wikipedia was “not about paywalls” but rather “the ability to offload copyright issues.” They later wrote that things had turned out “pretty well” and said they would “scale down the ‘DDoS’.”

“Why didn’t you write about such events earlier, folks of the tabloids?” they said. “I don’t expect you to write anything good, because then who would read you, but there was plenty of dramas, wasn’t there? Because there was no Jani to nudge you?”
