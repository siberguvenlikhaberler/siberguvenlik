Threat actors are luring unsuspecting users into running trojanized gaming utilities that are distributed via browsers and chat platforms to distribute a remote access trojan (RAT).

"A malicious downloader staged a portable Java runtime and executed a malicious Java archive (JAR) file named jd-gui.jar," the Microsoft Threat Intelligence team said in a post on X. "This downloader used PowerShell and living-off-the-land binaries (LOLBins) like cmstp.exe for stealthy execution."

The attack chain is also designed to evade detection by deleting the initial downloader and by configuring Microsoft Defender exclusions for the RAT components.

Persistence is achieved by means of a scheduled task and Windows startup script named "world.vbs," before the final payload is deployed on the compromised host. The malware, per Microsoft, is a "multi-purpose malware" that acts as a loader, runner, downloader, and RAT.

Once launched, it connects to an external server at "79.110.49[.]15" for command-and-control (C2) communications, allowing it to exfiltrate data and deploy additional payloads.

As ways to defend against the threat, users are advised to audit Microsoft Defender exclusions and scheduled tasks, remove malicious tasks and startup scripts, isolate affected endpoints, and reset credentials for users active on compromised hosts.

The disclosure comes as BlackFog disclosed details of a new Windows RAT malware family called Steaelite that was first advertised on criminal forums in November 2025 as a "best Windows RAT" with "fully undetectable" (FUD) capabilities. It's compatible with both Windows 10 and 11.

Unlike other off-the-shelf RATs sold to criminal actors, Steaelite bundles together data theft and ransomware, packaging them into one web panel, with an Android ransomware module on the way. The panel also incorporates various developer tools to facilitate keylogging, client-to-victim chat, file searching, USB spreading, wallpaper modification, UAC bypass, and clipper functionality.

Other notable features include removing competing malware, disabling Microsoft Defender, or configuring exclusions, and installing persistence methods.

As for its main capabilities, Steaelite RAT supports remote code execution, file management, live streaming, webcam and microphone access, process management, clipboard monitoring, password theft, installed program enumeration, location tracking, arbitrary file execution, URL opening, DDoS attacks, and VB.NET payload compilation.

"The tool gives operators browser-based control over infected Windows machines, covering remote code execution, credential theft, live surveillance, file exfiltration, and ransomware deployment from a single dashboard," security researcher Wendy McCague said.

"A single threat actor can browse files, exfiltrate documents, harvest credentials, and deploy ransomware from the same dashboard. This enables complete double extortion from one tool."

In recent weeks, threat hunters have also discovered two new RAT families tracked as DesckVB RAT and KazakRAT that enable comprehensive remote control over infected hosts and even selectively deploy capabilities post-compromise. According to Ctrl Alt Intel, KazakRAT is suspected to be the work of a suspected state-affiliated cluster targeting Kazakh and Afghan entities as part of a persistent campaign ongoing since at least August 2022.

[2] The Hacker News - Meta Files Lawsuits Against Brazil, China, Vietnam Advertisers Over Celeb-Bait Scams
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Meta on Thursday said it's taking legal action to tackle scams on its platforms by filing lawsuits against what it calls deceptive advertisers based in Brazil, China, and Vietnam.

As part of the effort, the advertisers' methods of payment have been suspended, related accounts have been disabled, and the website domain names used to pull off the scams have been blocked.

Concurrently, the social media giant said it has also issued cease and desist letters to eight marketing consultants who advertised the ability to bypass its ad policy enforcement systems. This included fake "un-ban" or account restoration services and renting access to trusted accounts so as to help clients bypass its controls.

At least three advertisers, two from Brazil and one from China, were found to engage in celeb-bait scams, which often involve misusing the image of well-known figures to trick people into clicking on bogus ads that lead to scam sites. These websites are designed to harvest sensitive data or dupe unsuspecting users into sending money or investing in fake platforms.

The three advertisers against whom Meta has filed lawsuits are listed below -

Brazil-based Vitor Lourenço de Souza and Milena Luciani Sanchez are being sued for using altered images and voices of celebrities to promote fraudulent healthcare products.

Brazil-based B&B Suplementos e Cosméticos Ltda. (Brites Corp), Brites Academia de Treinamento Ltda., Daniel de Brites Macieira Cordeiro, and José Victor de Brites Chaves de Araújo for being part of a scam operation that leveraged synthetic imagery of a prominent physician to advertise healthcare products without regulatory approval and sold courses teaching the same tactics.

China-based Shenzhen Yunzheng Technology Co., Ltd for using celeb-bait ads to target people in various countries, including the U.S. and Japan, as part of a fraud scheme designed to lure them into joining investment groups.

"To fight celeb-bait scams, we developed protections for celebrities whose images are repeatedly used in these schemes," Meta said. "This program currently protects the images of more than 500,000 celebrities and public figures around the world."

In addition, the company noted that it sued Vietnam-based advertiser Lý Văn Lâm for using cloaking techniques to get around its review process. Cloaking refers to an adversarial technique that aims to conceal the true nature of a website linked to an ad in an attempt to fool ad review systems by serving one version of its content during the review and showing an entirely different and malicious content to real users.

In this case, the advertiser is said to have used scam ads to offer discounted items from well-known brands in exchange for completing a survey. People who interacted with these ads were taken to phony websites where they were asked to enter credit card information to purchase items that were never delivered. Their credit cards also incurred unauthorized, recurring fees, a practice known as subscription fraud.

The development comes months after a Reuters investigation found that 19% of Meta's $18 billion in ad sales in China in 2024 came from ads for scams, illegal gambling, pornography, and other banned content. The report also uncovered agencies that allow businesses to run banned advertisements, prompting the company to put its Badged Partners program under review.

In an analysis of 14.5 million ads running on Meta platforms across the E.U. and U.K. over a 23-day period, Gen Digital found that nearly one in three of those ads (about 30.99%) pointed to a scam, phishing, or malware link.

"In total, scam ads generated more than 300 million impressions in less than a month," the cybersecurity company said earlier this month. "The activity was highly concentrated, with just 10 advertisers responsible for over 56% of all observed scam ads. Repeated campaign clusters were traced to shared payment and infrastructure linked to China and Hong Kong, indicating organized, industrial-scale operations rather than isolated bad actors."

These findings also coincide with the discovery of malicious infrastructure and underground services that have been used to peddle various kinds of scams -

Scams have been found to combine malvertising and pig butchering fraud models to defraud victims, primarily those in Japan, by tricking them into clicking on investment-themed ads on social media. These ads redirect victims to websites that prompt them to engage with a supposed expert via messaging apps by scanning a QR code.

Once victims are added to one-on-one and group chats with these so-called experts, who are nothing but artificial intelligence (AI)-powered chatbots in some cases, they are persuaded to invest progressively larger amounts of money, only to demand a "release fee" to unlock non-existent profits. More than 23,000 domains within this ecosystem have been discovered.

Threat actors are compromising routers to alter DNS settings to use shadow resolvers hosted in Aeza International, a bulletproof hosting company (BPH) sanctioned by the U.S. Government in July 2025. This unauthorized modification is engineered to selectively alter DNS responses associated with Okta and Shopify, allowing the operators to direct users to scam and malware content by means of an HTTP-based traffic distribution system (TDS).

A malicious push notification network has been observed using a network of malicious domains to target Android Chrome users all over the world with a steady stream of unwanted push notifications (e.g., "Android infected with malware!" or "System needs a scan") after obtaining permissions in a bid to direct to scam sites and adult content. According to data from Infoblox, Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, and Pakistan represented 50% of all the traffic.

A network of over 150 cloned, fake websites has been identified impersonating real law firms based in the U.S. and the U.K., and targeting users looking for legal advice and representation to promote a business impersonation scam.

"The sites used the firm's name, branding, and publicly available attorney identities, presenting themselves as legitimate legal and asset-recovery services, offering to help victims recover funds lost to prior fraud," Sygnia said. "The campaign targeted individuals who had already suffered financial fraud."

The proliferation of scams, fueled by a booming pig butchering‑as‑a‑service (PBaaS) economy, has not escaped law enforcement's attention, as evidenced by the dismantling of scam compounds in Southeast Asia in recent months.

Earlier this month, the Cambodian government promised to crack down and dismantle cyber scam networks operating within its borders, adding that police officials launched 48 operations in the first nine months of 2025 to combat cyber fraud, arrested 168 people, and deported 2,722 people back to their home countries.

The ongoing efforts have cut scam activity in half since the start of this year, Senior Minister Chhay Sinarith, chairman of the Secretariat of the Commission for Combating Technology Crimes, was quoted as saying this week. Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet also acknowledged that online scam centres operating in the country are damaging the country's reputation and undermining its economy.

[3] The Hacker News - Aeternum C2 Botnet Stores Encrypted Commands on Polygon Blockchain to Evade Takedown
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Thu, 26 Feb 2026 23:30:00 +0530

[TAM METİN - 842 kelime]
Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed details of a new botnet loader called Aeternum C2 that uses a blockchain-based command-and-control (C2) infrastructure to make it resilient to takedown efforts.

"Instead of relying on traditional servers or domains for command-and-control, Aeternum stores its instructions on the public Polygon blockchain," Qrator Labs said in a report shared with The Hacker News.

"This network is widely used by decentralized applications, including Polymarket, the world's largest prediction market. This approach makes Aeternum's C2 infrastructure effectively permanent and resistant to traditional takedown methods."

This is not the first time botnets have been found relying on blockchain for C2. In 2021, Google said it took steps to disrupt a botnet known as Glupteba that uses the Bitcoin blockchain as a backup C2 mechanism to fetch the actual C2 server address.

Details of Aeternum C2 first emerged in December 2025, when Outpost24's KrakenLabs revealed that a threat actor by the name of LenAI was advertising the malware on underground forums for $200 that grants customers access to a panel and a configured build. For $4,000, customers were allegedly promised the entire C++ codebase along with updates.

A native C++ loader available in both x32 and x64 builds, the malware works by writing commands to be issued to the infected host to smart contracts on the Polygon blockchain. The bots then read those commands by querying public remote procedure call (RPC) endpoints.

All of this is managed via the web-based panel, from where customers can select a smart contract, choose a command type, specify a payload URL and update it. The command, which can target all endpoints or a specific one, is written into the blockchain as a transaction, after which it becomes available to every compromised device that's polling the network.

"Once a command is confirmed, it cannot be altered or removed by anyone other than the wallet holder," Qrator Labs said. "The operator can manage multiple smart contracts simultaneously, each one potentially serving a different payload or function, such as a clipper, a stealer, a RAT, or a miner."

According to a two-part research published by Ctrl Alt Intel earlier this month, the C2 panel is implemented as a Next.js web application that allows operators to deploy smart contracts to the Polygon blockchain. The smart contracts contain a function that, when called by the malware via the Polygon RPC, causes it to return the encrypted command that's subsequently decoded and run on the victim machines.

Besides using the blockchain to turn it into a takedown-resistant botnet, the malware packs in various anti-analysis features to extend the lifespan of infections. This includes checks to detect virtualized environments, in addition to equipping customers with the ability to scan their builds via Kleenscan to ensure that they are not flagged by antivirus vendors.

"The operational costs are negligible: $1 worth of MATIC, the native token of the Polygon network, is enough for 100 to 150 command transactions," the Czechian cybersecurity vendor said. "The operator doesn't need to rent servers, register domains, or maintain any infrastructure beyond a crypto wallet and a local copy of the panel."

The threat actor has since attempted to sell the entire toolkit for an asking price of $10,000, claiming a lack of time for support and their involvement in another project. "I will sell the entire project to one person with permission for resale and commercial use, with all 'rights,'" LenAI wrote in a dark web forum post. "I will also give useful tips/notes on development that I did not have time to implement."

It's worth noting that LenAI is also behind a second crimeware solution called ErrTraffic that enables threat actors to automate ClickFix attacks by generating fake glitches on compromised websites to induce a false sense of urgency and deceive users into following malicious instructions.

The disclosure comes as Infrawatch published details of an underground service that deploys dedicated laptop hardware into American homes to co-opt the devices into a residential proxy network named DSLRoot that redirects malicious traffic through them.

The hardware is designed to run a Delphi-based program called DSLPylon that's equipped with capabilities to enumerate supported modems on the network, as well as remotely control the residential networking equipment and Android devices via an Android Debug Bridge (ADB) integration.

"Attribution analysis identifies the operator as a Belarusian national with residential presence in Minsk and Moscow," Infrawatch said. "DSLRoot is estimated to operate roughly 300 active hardware devices across 20+ U.S. states."

The operator has been identified as Andrei Holas (aka Andre Holas and Andrei Golas), with the service promoted on BlackHatWorld by a user operating under the alias GlobalSolutions, claiming to offer physical residential ADSL proxies for sale for $190 per month for unrestricted access. It is also available for $990 for six months and $1,750 for annual subscriptions.

"DSLRoot's custom software provides automated remote management of consumer modems (ARRIS/Motorola, Belkin, D-Link, ASUS) and Android devices via ADB, enabling IP address rotation and connectivity control," the company noted. "The network operates without authentication, allowing clients to route traffic anonymously through U.S. residential IPs."

[4] The Hacker News - UAT-10027 Targets U.S. Education and Healthcare with Dohdoor Backdoor
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[TAM METİN - 525 kelime]
A previously undocumented threat activity cluster has been attributed to an ongoing malicious campaign targeting education and healthcare sectors in the U.S. since at least December 2025.

The campaign is being tracked by Cisco Talos under the moniker UAT-10027. The end goal of the attacks is to deliver a never-before-seen backdoor codenamed Dohdoor.

"Dohdoor utilizes the DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) technique for command-and-control (C2) communications and has the ability to download and execute other payload binaries reflectively," security researchers Alex Karkins and Chetan Raghuprasad said in a technical report shared with The Hacker News.

Although the initial access vector used in the campaign is currently not known, it's suspected to involve the use of social engineering phishing techniques, leading to the execution of a PowerShell script.

The script then proceeds to download and run a Windows batch script from a remote staging server, which, for its part, facilitates the download of a malicious Windows dynamic-link library (DLL) that's named "propsys.dll" or "batmeter.dll."

The DLL payload – i.e., Dohdoor – is launched by means of a legitimate Windows executable (e.g., "Fondue.exe," "mblctr.exe," and "ScreenClippingHost.exe") using a technique referred to as DLL side-loading. The backdoored access created by the implant is used to retrieve a next-stage payload directly into the victim's memory and execute it. The payload is assessed to be a Cobalt Strike Beacon.

"The threat actor hides the C2 servers behind the Cloudflare infrastructure, ensuring that all outbound communication from the victim machine appears as legitimate HTTPS traffic to a trusted global IP address," Talos said.

"This technique bypasses DNS-based detection systems, DNS sinkholes, and network traffic analysis tools that monitor suspicious domain lookups, ensuring that the malware's C2 communications remain stealth by traditional network security infrastructure."

Dohdoor has also been found to unhook system calls to bypass endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions that monitor Windows API calls through user-mode hooks in NTDLL.dll.

Raghuprasad told The Hacker News that, "the attacker had infected several educational institutions, including a university that is connected to several other institutions, indicating a potential wider attack surface. Additionally, one of the affected entities was a healthcare facility, specifically for elderly care."

Analysis of the campaign has revealed no evidence of data exfiltration to date. Although no final payloads have been observed other than what appears to be the Cobalt Strike Beacon to backdoor into the victim's environment, it's believed that UAT-10027's actions are likely driven by financial gain based on the victimology pattern, the researcher added.

There is currently no clarity on who is behind UAT-10027, but Cisco Talos said it found some tactical similarities between Dohdoor and LazarLoader, a downloader previously identified as used by the North Korean hacking group Lazarus in attacks aimed at South Korea.

"While UAT-10027's malware shares technical overlaps with the Lazarus Group, the campaign’s focus on the education and health care sectors deviates from Lazarus' typical profile of cryptocurrency and defense targeting," Talos concluded.

"However, [...] North Korean APT actors have targeted the healthcare sector using Maui ransomware, and another North Korean APT group, Kimsuky, has targeted the education sector, highlighting the overlaps in the victimology of UAT-10027 with that of other North Korean APTs."

Nothing here looks dramatic at first glance. That’s the point. Many of this week’s threats begin with something ordinary, like an ad, a meeting invite, or a software update.

Behind the scenes, the tactics are sharper. Access happens faster. Control is established sooner. Cleanup becomes harder.

Here is a quick look at the signals worth paying attention to.

AI-powered command execution

Kali Linux Integrates Claude AI Assistant via MCP


      Kali Linux, an advanced penetration testing Linux distribution used for ethical hacking and network security assessments, has added an integration with Anthropic's Claude large language model through the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to issue commands in natural language and translate them into technical commands.

Belarus-linked Android spyware

ResidentBat Infrastructure Analyzed


      ResidentBat is an Android spyware implant used by Belarusian authorities for surveillance operations against journalists and civil society. Once installed, it provides operators with access to call logs, microphone recordings, SMS, encrypted messenger traffic, screen captures, and locally stored files. The malware, although first documented in December 2025, is assessed to date back to 2021. According to Censys, ResidentBat-associated infrastructure is concentrated in Europe and Russia: the Netherlands (5 hosts), Germany (2 hosts), Switzerland (2 hosts), and Russia (1 host) in a recent Platform view, using a narrow port range (7000-7257) for control traffic.

Crypto phishing wave

Phishing Campaigns Impersonate Bitpanda


      Phishing campaigns are impersonating cryptocurrency brokerage services like Bitpanda to harvest sensitive data under the pretext of reconfirming their information or risk having their accounts blocked. "Attempting to get multiple forms of information and identification, the attackers used tactics that would seem legitimate to the everyday user," Cofense said. "User information such as name verification, email, and password credentials, and location were all used in this attempt to harvest information under the guise of a multi-factor authentication process."

Breakout times shrink

Adversaries Get Faster in 2025


      In its 2026 Global Threat Report, CrowdStrike said adversaries became faster than ever before in 2025. "The average e-crime breakout time — the period between initial access and lateral movement onto another system — dropped to 29 minutes, a 65% increase in speed from 2024," the company said. One such intrusion undertaken by Luna Moth (aka Chatty Spider) targeting a law firm moved from initial access to data exfiltration in four minutes. Chief among the factors fueling this dramatic acceleration was the widespread abuse of legitimate credentials, which allowed attackers to blend into normal network traffic and bypass many traditional security controls. This was coupled with threat actors of varied motivations utilizing AI technology to accelerate and optimize their existing techniques. Some of the threat actors that have leveraged AI in their operations include Fancy Bear, Punk Spider (aka Akira), Blind Spider (aka Blind Eagle), Odyssey Spider (aka TA558), and an India-nexus hacking group called Frantic Tiger that has used Netlify and Cloudflare pages for credential-harvesting operations. The cybersecurity company said it observed an 89% increase in the number of attacks by AI-enabled adversaries compared to 2024 and a 42% year-over-year increase in zero-days exploited prior to public disclosure. In tandem, 67% of vulnerabilities exploited by China-nexus adversaries provided immediate system access, and 40% targeted edge devices that typically lack comprehensive monitoring. The vast majority of attacks, 82%, were free of malware — highlighting attackers' enduring shift toward hands-on-keyboard operations and the abuse of legitimate tools and credentials.

4-minute lateral movement

Fastest Attacker Breakout Time Drops to 4 Minutes


      In a similar report, ReliaQuest said the fastest intrusions reached lateral movement in just 4 minutes, an 85% acceleration from last year, with data exfiltration taking place in 6 minutes. The statistic is fueled by attackers increasingly weaving AI and automation into their tradecraft. "As attackers increasingly secure valid credentials with elevated privileges, the time to react has drastically dropped," ReliaQuest said. "In 2025, the average breakout time (initial access to lateral movement) dropped to 34 minutes. In 47% of incidents, they secured high privileges before ever touching the network. This allows them to skip escalation, blend into traffic, and repurpose legitimate tools."

ClickFix fuels Mac stealers

Mac Users Targeted by Stealer Malware Using ClickFix


      Mac users searching for popular software like Homebrew, 7-Zip, Notepad++, LibreOffice, and Final Cut Pro are the target of an active malvertising campaign powered by at least 35 hijacked Google advertiser accounts originating from countries including the U.S., Canada, Italy, Poland, Brazil, India, Saudi Arabia, Japan, China, Romania, Malta, Slovenia, Germany, the U.K., and the U.A.E. More than 200 malicious advertisements impersonating legitimate macOS software have been found. The end goal of these efforts is to direct users to fake pages that contain ClickFix-like instructions to deliver MacSync stealer. Another ClickFix campaign has been observed using fake CAPTCHA verification lures on bogus phishing pages to distribute stealer malware that can harvest data from web browsers, gaming apps like Steam, cryptocurrency wallets, and VPN apps. According to ReliaQuest data, a quarter of attacks used social engineering for initial access last year, with ClickFix responsible for delivering 59% of the top malware families.

Encryption debate resurfaces

Meta Executive Warned Against Encryption in Messenger and Instagram


      Meta went ahead with a plan to encrypt the messaging services connected to its Facebook and Instagram apps despite internal warnings that it would hinder the social media giant's ability to flag child-exploitation cases to law enforcement, Reuters reported. The internal chat exchange dated March 2019 was filed in connection with a lawsuit brought by the U.S. state of New Mexico, accusing it of exposing children and teens to sexual exploitation on its platforms and profiting from it. In response to the concerns raised, Meta said it worked on additional safety features before it launched encrypted messaging on Facebook and Instagram in 2023.

ActiveMQ flaw aids LockBit

Apache ActiveMQ Exploit Leads to LockBit Ransomware


      Threat actors are exploiting a now-patched security flaw in internet-facing Apache ActiveMQ servers (CVE-2023-46604) to deploy LockBit ransomware. "Despite being evicted after the initial intrusion, they successfully breached the same server on a second occasion 18 days later," The DFIR Report said. "After compromising the server, the threat actor used Metasploit, possibly along with Meterpreter, to perform post-exploitation activities. These activities included escalating privileges, accessing LSASS process memory, and moving laterally across the network. After regaining access following their eviction, the threat actor swiftly transitioned to deploying ransomware. They leveraged credentials extracted during their previous breach to deploy LockBit ransomware via RDP." The ransomware is suspected to be crafted using the leaked LockBit builder.

Chrome crash-to-command trick

CrashFix Variants Detailed


      Two newly flagged Google Chrome extensions, Pixel Shield - Block Ads (ID: nlogodaofdghipmbdclajkkpheneldjd) and PageGuard - Phishing Protection (ID: mlaonedihngoginmmlaacpihnojcoocl), have been found to adopt the same playbook as CrashFix, where the browser is deliberately crashed, and the user is tricked into running a malicious command à la ClickFix. The most concerning aspect of this campaign is that the extensions actually work and offer the advertised functionality. "The original NexShield DoS created a billion chrome.runtime.connect() calls," Annex Security's John Tuckner said. "These variants use a different technique I'm calling the Promise Bomb because it crashes the browser by flooding Chrome's message passing system with millions of unresolvable promises." While the original NexShield used timer-based activation, the new variants have evolved to push notification-based command-and-control (C2), causing the denial-of-service to be triggered only when the C2 server sends a push notification containing a "newVersion" value ending in "2." This, in turn, gives the attacker selective remote control over when the crashes happen.

Two newly flagged Google Chrome extensions, Pixel Shield - Block Ads (ID: nlogodaofdghipmbdclajkkpheneldjd) and PageGuard - Phishing Protection (ID: mlaonedihngoginmmlaacpihnojcoocl), have been found to adopt the same playbook as CrashFix, where the browser is deliberately crashed, and the user is tricked into running a malicious command à la ClickFix.

WinRAR patch lag persists

Widespread Exposure to CVE-2025-8088


      Cybersecurity firm Stairwell said more than 80% of the IT networks it monitors run versions of WinRAR vulnerable to CVE-2025-8088, a vulnerability that has been widely exploited by cybercrime and cyber espionage groups. "This finding underscores a persistent challenge in enterprise security when widely deployed, trusted software that quietly falls out of date and becomes a high-value target for attackers," Alex Hegyi said.

Crypto IV reuse risk

Open-Source Projects Use Crypto Libraries with Insecure Defaults


      A new analysis from Trail of Bits has revealed that more than 723,000 open-source projects use cryptographic libraries with insecure defaults. The aes-js and pyaes libraries have been found to provide a default initialization vector (IV) in their AES-CTR API, leading to a large number of key/IV reuse bugs. "Reusing a key/IV pair leads to serious security issues: if you encrypt two messages in CTR mode or GCM with the same key and IV, then anybody with access to the ciphertexts can recover the XOR of the plaintexts, and that’s a very bad thing," Trail of Bits said. While neither library has been updated in years, strongSwan has released an update to address the problem in strongMan (CVE-2026-25998).

Fake FSB extortion plot

Moscow Man Accused of Impersonating FSB to Extort Conti Gang


      A Russian national has been accused of trying to extort money from the notorious Conti ransomware group by posing as an officer of Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB), according to local media reports. RBC reported that the suspect, Ruslan Satuchin, posed as an FSB officer and demanded a large payment from Conti. Although an investigation was formally launched in September 2025, the incident allegedly began in September 2022 when Satuchin contacted one of the members of the hacker group and extorted them to avoid criminal liability. Once a prolific ransomware gang, Conti shut down its operations in mid-2022 after splintering into small groups.

Ad cloaking service exposed

1Campaign Service Helps Malicious Google Ads Evade Detection


      Varonis has disclosed details of a newly identified cybercrime service known as 1Campaign that enables threat actors to run malicious Google Ads for extended periods of time while evading scrutiny. The cloaking platform "passes Google's screening, filters out security researchers, and keeps phishing and crypto drainer pages online for as long as possible, funneling real users to attacker-controlled sites," Varonis security researcher Daniel Kelley said. "It combines real-time visitor filtering, fraud scoring, geographic targeting, and a bot guard script generator into a single dashboard." It's developed and maintained by a threat actor named DuppyMeister for over three years, along with offering Telegram channels for support. Traffic linked to 1Campaign has been distributed across the U.S., Canada, the Netherlands, China, Germany, France, Japan, Hungary, and Albania.

Teams call drops macOS malware

Social Engineering Using Teams Leads to macOS Malware


      A social engineering campaign has been observed using Microsoft Teams meetings to trick attendants into installing macOS malware. Daylight Security has assessed that the activity is consistent with an ongoing attack campaign orchestrated by North Korean threat actors under the name GhostCall. "During the call, the attacker claimed audio issues and coached the victim into running terminal commands that downloaded and executed malicious binaries," Daylight researchers Kyle Henson and Oren Biderman said. "Analysts observed staged downloads and execution from macOS cache and temporary paths, Keychain credential access, and outbound connections to newly created attacker-controlled domains."

RAMP fallout reshapes underground

What Happened Post RAMP Shutdown?


      Last month, law enforcement authorities from the U.S. seized the notorious RAMP cybercrime forum. The event has had a cascading impact, destabilising trust and accelerating fragmentation across the underground cybercrime ecosystem. There are also speculations that RAMP may have functioned as a honeypot or had been compromised long before its seizure. "Rather than consolidating around a single successor, ransomware actors are redistributing across both gated platforms like T1erOne and accessible forums such as Rehub," Rapid7 said. "This shift reflects adaptation, not decline. Disruption fractures trust and redistributes coordination across multiple platforms."

Repo-squatting via Google Ads

GPUGate Campaign Delivers Hijack Loader


      Users searching for developer tools have become the target of an ongoing campaign dubbed GPUGate that uses a malicious installer to deliver Hijack Loader and Atomic Stealer. "The attacker creates a throwaway GitHub account and forks the official GitHub Desktop repository," GMO Cybersecurity by Ierae said. "The attacker edits the download link in the README to point to their malicious installer and commits the change. Lastly, the attacker used sponsored ads for 'GitHub Desktop' to promote their commit, using an anchor in README.md to skip past GitHub's cautions." Victims who downloaded the malicious Windows installer would execute a multi-stage loader, while Mac victims received Atomic Stealer.

The warning signs are there for those who look closely. Small gaps, delayed patches, misplaced trust, and rushed clicks still make the biggest difference.

Staying aware of these shifts is no longer optional. The details change each week. The pressure does not.

Introduction: Steal It Today, Break It in a Decade

Digital evolution is unstoppable, and though the pace may vary, things tend to fall into place sooner rather than later. That, of course, applies to adversaries as well. The rise of ransomware and cyber extortion generated funding for a complex and highly professional criminal ecosystem. The era of the cloud brought general availability of almost infinite amounts of storage. So there is literally nothing that stops criminals from stealing and trafficking heaps of data, be it encrypted or not.

Patient adversaries are employing a "Harvest Now, Decrypt Later" (HNDL) strategy. They are quietly accumulating encrypted data with the intention of decrypting it later using quantum computers. Any data requiring long-term security, such as trade secrets or classified designs, is vulnerable because its lifespan will inevitably outlive its current encryption. Therefore, it is crucial that organizations begin planning their PQC migration now, ensuring that data encrypted today remains secure against future quantum-enabled decryption attacks.

The Quantum Waiting Game

Cryptography is the backbone of digital trust, but the looming era of quantum computing threatens its foundations.

Harnessing quantum physics, future quantum machines will effortlessly break the mathematical encryption schemes that protect data today. Current prototypes [1] are not quite there yet because they fundamentally lack the scale and error-correction capability required to successfully execute complex quantum algorithms. However, the prospect of a mature, cryptographically relevant quantum computer (CRQC) is alarming. Such a machine could likely break modern encryption in a matter of minutes, likely by 2030 to 2035.

To combat the looming quantum computing threat, our cryptography must evolve immediately. This is why Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) [2] is being introduced as a solution. PQC provides new cryptographic algorithms designed to withstand attacks from both today's classical computers and future quantum machines.

A Step-by-Step Guide to Future-Proofing with PQC

PQC migration is a complex process that spans the entire organization and potentially reaches deep into its security architecture. This massive transition is complicated by the current state of industry planning. There is still a lack of consensus in technical literature regarding common steps or uniform terminology for migration strategies. Without a common language, companies find it difficult to effectively compare, adopt, or coordinate the most suitable migration strategies.

Our research concludes that the following strategy offers an effective, universal framework that can be adapted to suit any organization. [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

At this stage, it is important to emphasize that a migration team must be established for each migration. This team should consist of cryptography and cybersecurity experts and managers from the software system or infrastructure being migrated. The team will drive the migration process forward and ensure its completion.

Step 1 (Preparation): This phase establishes the scope and leadership for the PQC migration process. Key activities include assessing the relevance and urgency of PQC, appointing a program lead, aligning stakeholders on clear goals, and initiating conversations with vendors to determine migration needs.

Step 2 (Diagnosis): This phase involves a thorough evaluation of the current cybersecurity posture to establish a comprehensive security baseline. Key activities include documenting all cryptographic assets, categorizing data based on their confidential lifespan, identifying suppliers of cryptographic tools to evaluate their PQC readiness, and conducting a formal risk assessment to generate a prioritized asset list based on principles such as Mosca's theorem [12].

Step 3 (Planning): Once the urgency and scope are determined, this phase focuses on the "how" and "when“. It focuses on the migration strategy, creating a comprehensive business and technical plan and timeline based on the urgency and scope determined in previous steps. Key activities involve appointing a dedicated migration manager to oversee the process and conducting a comprehensive cost estimate for the entire migration.

Step 4 (Execution): This critical phase involves executing the plan to establish a quantum-safe environment through careful technical implementation. Key activities include maintaining backward compatibility via a hybrid cryptographic approach, implementing recommended PQC primitives for key exchange and signatures, adjusting key sizes, and integrating cryptographic agility to ensure rapid adaptation with minimal service disruption.

Step 5 (Continuous Monitoring and Update): This final phase focuses on continuous vigilance after migration, recognizing the dynamic cryptographic landscape. Key activities include routinely reviewing and updating the cryptographic inventory, conducting regular reviews of emerging threats to PQC schemes, performing proactive security audits and vulnerability assessments, and staying updated on the latest PQC advances to ensure timely system and software updates.

Addressing Key Challenges: A Practical Checklist

To ensure a successful PQC migration, organizations must proactively identify and mitigate key obstacles that could hinder progress. They must recognize that the transition involves navigating three interdependent categories of challenges.

Organizational challenges: These non-technical obstacles relate to people, strategic planning, internal governance, and coordination across the wider ecosystem, often complicated by a lack of urgency or qualified personnel.

PQC challenges: These stem directly from the immaturity of the new technology. Although we now have initial standards, such as ML-KEM and its implementation in protocols like TLS, a lack of standardization for a complete suite of algorithms and uncertainty in selecting and testing reliable PQC solutions remain major hurdles. The main issue is the lack of specific implementation guidelines, such as how to effectively deploy hybridization or agility mechanisms.

Code and Documentation challenges: These are technical hurdles caused by the inherent rigidity of existing IT infrastructure (legacy systems), the need for extensive code modification, and the complexity of implementing secure cryptographic changes.

The following breaks down the major obstacles to a successful PQC migration and offers solutions for each. Each obstacle falls under one of the previously established challenge categories. See references [71] and [11] for a more comprehensive discussion of additional obstacles.

Lack of Urgency and Business Case (Organizational):

Problem: The quantum threat seems distant, making it challenging to establish a sense of urgency and budget approval from leadership.

Solution: Organizations can use tools like Mosca's Theorem [12] to quantify their vulnerability and take inventory of cryptographic assets to improve current cybersecurity regardless of the quantum timeline.

Internal Knowledge and Skills Deficit (Organizational):

Problem: Lack of internal knowledge about quantum-based threats, and shortage of qualified personnel to implement new PQC solutions. 
Solution: Launch training initiatives for IT and management. Engage external PQC consultants to design the strategy and knowledge transfer.

Solution: Adopt recent PQC standards proactively for critical systems to meet the "state-of-the-art" requirement. Leverage EUCC certification and monitor ETSI/OpenSSL for implementation guidance.

Uncertain Selection Criteria (PQC):

Problem: Organizations struggle to decide between an all-at-once or phased hybrid approach to replacing PQC, as they lack clear criteria.
Solution: Default to a hybrid PQC model to gain operational knowledge, and minimize complications before committing to a full replacement strategy.

Solution: Default to a hybrid PQC model to gain operational knowledge, and minimize complications before committing to a full replacement strategy.

Security and Reliability Concerns (PQC):

Problem: Uncertainty about the maturity and security of PQC algorithms, organizations must balance present-day protection and future resilience.
Solution: Use a hybrid PQC approach with a staged rollout. Begin with non-critical areas before expanding to ensure the solution is stable and reliable.

Solution: Replace hardware to accommodate PQC demands. If this is not feasible, implement lightweight, optimized PQC libraries.

Ecosystem Interdependency (Code and Documentation):

Problem: The interconnected nature of the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) means that a PQC transition affects all involved parties, including standards bodies, hardware/software vendors, and certificate authorities (CAs).
Solution: Collaborate with suppliers and CAs, participate in industry and regulatory groups (e.g., NIST, CISA, ENISA, ETSI, ANSSI, NCSC and BSI), and map all third-party component dependencies.

Solution: Prioritize cryptographic agility by designing new systems that allow for algorithm swapping via simple configuration and centralized key and certificate support.

Urgency of Migration: Act immediately! The deadline is now. The time for waiting for CRQC is over. Organizations must start preparing and migrating their data immediately to ensure long-term security.

Establish Foundational Priorities: Strategic efforts must focus on developing a clear, actionable strategy for planning and executing the PQC transition smoothly.

Foster United Collaboration: The PQC transition demands a unified effort to address the collective security challenge. This requires actively sharing lessons learned and collaborating across industries, governments, and academia.

Embed Hybrid Cryptography and Cryptographic Agility: The ability to rapidly and seamlessly combine, modify or swap cryptographic primitives must be adopted as the cornerstone of the new security posture to adapt to future advances in quantum-safe standards.

Acknowledge Interdependent Challenges: The success of any PQC migration hinges on recognizing that the transition involves navigating several interdependent categories of challenges.

[7] The Hacker News - Microsoft Warns Developers of Fake Next.js Job Repos Delivering In-Memory Malware
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Thu, 26 Feb 2026 16:05:00 +0530

[TAM METİN - 1278 kelime]
A "coordinated developer-targeting campaign" is using malicious repositories disguised as legitimate Next.js projects and technical assessments to trick victims into executing them and establish persistent access to compromised machines.

"The activity aligns with a broader cluster of threats that use job-themed lures to blend into routine developer workflows and increase the likelihood of code execution," the Microsoft Defender Security Research Team said in a report published this week.

The tech giant said the campaign is characterized by the use of multiple entry points that lead to the same outcome, where attacker-controlled JavaScript is retrieved at runtime and executed to facilitate command-and-control (C2).

The attacks rely on the threat actors setting up fake repositories on trusted developer platforms like Bitbucket, using names like "Cryptan-Platform-MVP1" to trick developers looking for jobs into running them as part of an assessment process.

Further analysis of the identified repositories has uncovered three distinct execution paths that, while triggered in different ways, have the end goal of executing an attacker‑controlled JavaScript directly in memory -

Visual Studio Code workspace execution, where Microsoft Visual Studio Code (VS Code) projects with workspace automation configuration are used to run malicious code retrieved from a Vercel domain as soon as the developer opens and trusts the project. This involves the use of the runOn: "folderOpen" to configure the task.

Build‑time execution during application development, where manually running the development server via "npm run dev" is enough to activate the execution of malicious code embedded within modified JavaScript libraries masquerading as jquery.min.js, causing it to fetch a JavaScript loader hosted on Vercel. The retrieved payload is then executed in memory by Node.js.

Server startup execution via environment exfiltration and dynamic remote code execution, where launching the application backend causes malicious loader logic concealed within a backend module or route file to be executed. The loader transmits the process environment to the external server and executes JavaScript received as a response in memory within the Node.js server process.

Microsoft noted that all three methods lead to the same JavaScript payload that's responsible for profiling the host and periodically polling a registration endpoint to get a unique "instanceId" identifier. This identifier is subsequently supplied in follow-on polls to correlate activity.

It's also capable of executing server-provided JavaScript in memory, ultimately paving the way for a second-stage controller that turns the initial foothold into a persistent access pathway for receiving tasks by contacting a different C2 server and executing them in memory to minimize leaving traces on disk.

"The controller maintains stability and session continuity, posts error telemetry to a reporting endpoint, and includes retry logic for resilience," Microsoft said. "It also tracks spawned processes and can stop managed activity and exit cleanly when instructed. Beyond on-demand code execution, Stage 2 supports operator-driven discovery and exfiltration."

While the Windows maker did not attribute the activity to a specific threat actor, the use of VS Code tasks and Vercel domains to stage malware is a tactic that has been adopted by North Korea-linked hackers associated with a long-running campaign known as Contagious Interview.

The end goal of these efforts is to gain the ability to deliver malware to developer systems, which often contain sensitive data, such as source code, secrets, and credentials, that can provide opportunities to pivot deeper into the target network.

In a report published Wednesday, Abstract Security said it has observed a shift in threat actor tactics, notably a spike in alternative staging servers used in the VS Code tasks commands instead of Vercel URLs. This includes the use of scripts hosted on GitHub gists ("gist.githubusercontent[.]com") to download and run next-stage payloads. An alternative approach employs URL shorteners like short[.]gy to conceal Vercel URLs.

The cybersecurity company said it also identified a malicious npm package, named "eslint-validator," linked to the campaign that retrieves and runs an obfuscated payload from a Google Drive URL. The payload in question is a known JavaScript malware referred to as BeaverTail.

Furthermore, a malicious VS Code task embedded within a GitHub repository has been found to initiate a Windows-only infection chain that runs a batch script to download Node.js runtime on the host (if it does not exist) and leverage the certutil program to parse a code block contained within the script. The decoded script is then executed with the previously obtained Node.js runtime to deploy a Python malware protected with PyArmor.

Cybersecurity company Red Asgard, which has also been extensively tracking the campaign, said the threat actors have leveraged crafted VS code projects that use the runOn: "folderOpen" trigger to deploy malware that, in turn, queries the Polygon blockchain to retrieve JavaScript stored within an NFT contract for improved resilience. The final payload is an information stealer that harvests credentials and data from web browsers, cryptocurrency wallets, and password managers.

"This developer‑targeting campaign shows how a recruiting‑themed 'interview project' can quickly become a reliable path to remote code execution by blending into routine developer workflows such as opening a repository, running a development server, or starting a backend," Microsoft concluded.

To counter the threat, the company is recommending that organizations harden developer workflow trust boundaries, enforce strong authentication and conditional access, maintain strict credential hygiene, apply the principle of least privilege to developer accounts and build identities, and separate build infrastructure where feasible.

The development comes as GitLab said it banned 131 unique accounts in 2025 that were engaged in distributing malicious code projects linked to the Contagious Interview campaign and the fraudulent IT worker scheme known as Wagemole.

"Threat actors typically originated from consumer VPNs when interacting with GitLab.com to distribute malware; however, they also intermittently originated from dedicated VPS infrastructure and likely laptop farm IP addresses," GitLab's Oliver Smith said. "Threat actors created accounts using Gmail email addresses in almost 90% of cases."

In more than 80% of the cases, per the software development platform, the threat actors are said to have leveraged at least six legitimate services to host malware payloads, including JSON Keeper, Mocki, npoint.io, Render, Railway.app, and Vercel. Among these, Vercel was the most commonly used, with the threat actors relying on the web development platform no less than 49 times in 2025.

"In December, we observed a cluster of projects executing malware via VS Code tasks, either piping remote content to a native shell or executing a custom script to decode malware from binary data in a fake font file," Smith added, corroborating the aforementioned findings from Microsoft.

Also discovered by GitLab was a private project "almost certainly" controlled by a North Korean national managing a North Korean IT worker cell that contained detailed financial and personnel records showing earnings of more than $1.64 million between Q1 2022 and Q3 2025. The project included more than 120 spreadsheets, presentations, and documents tracking quarterly income performance for individual team members.

"Records demonstrate that these operations function as structured enterprises with defined targets and operating procedures and close hierarchical oversight," GitLab noted. "This cell's demonstrated ability to cultivate facilitators globally provides a high degree of operational resiliency and money laundering flexibility."

In a report published earlier this month, Okta said the "vast majority" of interviews with IT workers do not progress to a second interview or job offer, but noted they are "learning from their mistakes" and that a large number of them seek temporary contract work as software developers hired out to third-party companies to take advantage of the fact that they are unlikely to enforce rigorous background checks.

"Some actors however seem to be more competent at crafting personas and passing screening interviews," it added. "A kind of IT Worker natural selection is at play. The most successful actors are very prolific, and scheduled hundreds of interviews each."

[8] The Hacker News - Malicious StripeApi NuGet Package Mimicked Official Library and Stole API Tokens
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Thu, 26 Feb 2026 15:39:00 +0530
Link: https://thehackernews.com/2026/02/malicious-stripeapi-nuget-package.html

[TAM METİN - 336 kelime]
Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed details of a new malicious package discovered on the NuGet Gallery, impersonating a library from financial services firm Stripe in an attempt to target the financial sector.

The package, codenamed StripeApi.Net, attempts to masquerade as Stripe.net, a legitimate library from Stripe that has over 75 million downloads. It was uploaded by a user named StripePayments on February 16, 2026. The package is no longer available.

"The NuGet page for the malicious package is set up to resemble the official Stripe.net package as closely as possible," ReversingLabs Petar Kirhmajer said. "It uses the same icon as the legitimate package and contains a nearly identical readme, only swapping the 'Stripe.net' references to read 'Stripe-net.'"

In a further effort to lend credibility to the typosquatted package, the threat actor behind the campaign is said to have artificially inflated the download count to more than 180,000. But in an interesting twist, the downloads were split across 506 versions, with each version recording about 300 downloads on average.

The package replicates some of the legitimate Stripe package's functionality, but also modifies certain critical methods to collect and transfer sensitive data, including the user's Stripe API token, back to the threat actor. With the rest of the codebases remaining fully functional, it's unlikely to attract any suspicion from unsuspecting developers who may have inadvertently downloaded it.

ReversingLabs said it discovered and reported the package "relatively soon" after it was initially released, causing it to be taken before it could inflict any serious damage.

The software supply chain security company also noted that the activity marks a shift from prior campaigns that have leveraged bogus NuGet packages to target the cryptocurrency ecosystem and facilitate wallet key theft.

"Developers who mistakenly download and integrate a typosquatted library like StripeAPI.net will still have their applications compile successfully and function as intended," Kirhmajer said. "Payments would process normally and, from the developer’s perspective, nothing would appear broken. In the background, however, sensitive data is being secretly copied and exfiltrated by malicious actors."

[9] The Hacker News - Cisco SD-WAN Zero-Day CVE-2026-20127 Exploited Since 2023 for Admin Access
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Thu, 26 Feb 2026 11:43:00 +0530
Link: https://thehackernews.com/2026/02/cisco-sd-wan-zero-day-cve-2026-20127.html

[TAM METİN - 772 kelime]
A newly disclosed maximum-severity security flaw in Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Controller (formerly vSmart) and Catalyst SD-WAN Manager (formerly vManage) has come under active exploitation in the wild as part of malicious activity that dates back to 2023.

The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2026-20127 (CVSS score: 10.0), allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to bypass authentication and obtain administrative privileges on an affected system by sending a crafted request.

Successful exploitation of the flaw could allow the adversary to obtain elevated privileges and log in to the system as an internal, high-privileged, non-root user account.

"This vulnerability exists because the peering authentication mechanism in an affected system is not working properly," Cisco said in an advisory, adding the threat actor could leverage the non-root user account to access NETCONF and manipulate network configuration for the SD-WAN fabric.

The shortcoming affects the following deployment types, irrespective of the device configuration -

Cisco Hosted SD-WAN Cloud

Cisco Hosted SD-WAN Cloud - Cisco Managed

Cisco Hosted SD-WAN Cloud - FedRAMP Environment

Cisco credited the Australian Signals Directorate's Australian Cyber Security Centre (ASD-ACSC) for reporting the vulnerability. The networking equipment major is tracking the exploitation and subsequent post-compromise activity under the moniker UAT-8616, describing the cluster as a "highly sophisticated cyber threat actor."

The vulnerability has been addressed in the following versions of Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN -

Prior to version 20.91 - Migrate to a fixed release.

Version 20.9 - 20.9.8.2

Version 20.111 - 20.12.6.1

Version 20.12.5 - 20.12.5.3

Version 20.12.6 - 20.12.6.1

Version 20.131 - 20.15.4.2

Version 20.141 - 20.15.4.2

Version 20.15 - 20.15.4.2

Version 20.161 - 20.18.2.1

Version 20.18 - 20.18.2.1

"Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Controller systems that are exposed to the internet and that have ports exposed to the internet are at risk of exposure to compromise," Cisco warned.

The company has also recommended customers to audit the "/var/log/auth.log" file for entries related to "Accepted publickey for vmanage-admin" from unknown or unauthorized IP addresses. It's also advised to check the IP addresses in the auth.log log file against the configured System IPs that are listed in the Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Manager web UI (WebUI > Devices > System IP).

According to information released by the ASD-ACSC, UAT-8616 is said to have compromised Cisco SD-WANs since 2023 via the zero-day exploit, allowing it to gain elevated access.

"The vulnerability allowed a malicious cyber actor to create a rogue peer joined to the network management plane, or control plane, of an organization's SD-WAN," ASD-ACSC said. "The rogue device appears as a new but temporary, actor-controlled SD-WAN component that can conduct trusted actions within the management and control plane."

After successfully compromising a public-facing application, the attackers have been found to leverage the built-in update mechanism to stage a software version downgrade and escalate to the root user by exploiting CVE-2022-20775 (CVSS score: 7.8), a high-severity privilege escalation bug in the CLI of Cisco SD-WAN Software, and then restoring the software back to the version it was originally running.

Some of the subsequent steps initiated by the threat actor are as follows -

Created local user accounts that mimicked other local user accounts.

Added a Secure Shell Protocol (SSH) authorized key for root access and modified SD-WAN-related start-up scripts to customize the environment.

Used Network Configuration Protocol on port 830 (NETCONF) and SSH to connect to/between Cisco SD-WAN appliances within the management plane.

Took steps to clear evidence of the intrusion by purging logs under "/var/log," command history, and network connection history.

"UAT-8616's attempted exploitation indicates a continuing trend of the targeting of network edge devices by cyber threat actors looking to establish persistent footholds into high-value organizations, including Critical Infrastructure (CI) sectors," Talos said.

The development has prompted the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to add both CVE-2022-20775 and CVE-2026-20127 to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, mandating Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to apply the fixes within the next 24 hours.

To check for version downgrade and unexpected reboot events, CISA recommends analyzing the following logs -

/var/volatile/log/vdebug

/var/log/tmplog/vdebug

/var/volatile/log/sw_script_synccdb.log

CISA has also issued a new emergency directive, 26-03: Mitigate Vulnerabilities in Cisco SD-WAN Systems, as part of which federal agencies are required to inventory SD-WAN devices, apply updates, and assess potential compromise.

To that end, agencies have been ordered to provide a catalog of all in-scope SD-WAN systems on their networks by February 26, 2026, 11:59 p.m. ET. Additionally, they are required to submit a detailed inventory of all in-scope products and actions taken by March 5, 2026, 11:59 p.m. ET. Lastly, the agencies will have to submit the list of all steps taken to harden their environments by March 26, 2026, 11:59 p.m. ET.

[10] BleepingComputer - Previously harmless Google API keys now expose Gemini AI data
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Thu, 26 Feb 2026 15:55:29 -0500
Link: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/previously-harmless-google-api-keys-now-expose-gemini-ai-data/

[TAM METİN - 607 kelime]
Google API keys for services like Maps embedded in accessible client-side code could be used to authenticate to the Gemini AI assistant and access private data.

Researchers found nearly 3,000 such keys while scanning internet pages from organizations in various sectors, and even from Google.

The problem occurred when Google introduced its Gemini assistant, and developers started enabling the LLM API in projects. Before this, Google Cloud API keys were not considered sensitive data and could be exposed online without risk.

Developers can use API keys to extend functionality in a project, such as loading Maps on a website to share a location, for YouTube embeds, usage tracking, or Firebase services.

When Gemini was introduced, Google Cloud API keys also acted as authentication credentials for Google's AI assistant.

Researchers at TruffleSecurity discovered the issue and warned that attackers could copy the API key from a website's page source and access private data available through the Gemini API service.

Since using the Gemini API is not free, an attacker could leverage the access and make API calls for their benefit.

"Depending on the model and context window, a threat actor maxing out API calls could generate thousands of dollars in charges per day on a single victim account," Truffle Security says.

The researchers warn that these API keys have been sitting exposed in public JavaScript code for years, and now they have suddenly gained more dangerous privileges without anyone noticing.

TruffleSecurity scanned the November 2025 Common Crawl dataset, a representative snapshot of a large swath of the most popular sites, and found more than 2,800 live Google API keys publicly exposed in their code.

According to the researchers, some of the keys were used by major financial institutions, security companies, and recruiting firms. They reported the problem to Google, providing samples from its infrastructure.

In one case, an API key acting just as an identifier was deployed since at least February 2023 and was embedded in the page source of a Google product's public-facing website.

Truffle Security tested the key by calling the Gemini API's /models endpoint and listing available models.

The researchers informed Google of the problem last year on November 21.  After a long exchange, Google classified the flaw as “single-service privilege escalation” on January 13, 2026.

In a statement for BleepingComputer, Google says that it is aware of the report and has "worked with the researchers to address the issue."

"We have already implemented proactive measures to detect and block leaked API keys that attempt to access the Gemini API,” a Google spokesperson told BleepingComputer.

Google stated that new AI Studio keys will default to Gemini-only scope, leaked API keys will be blocked from accessing Gemini, and proactive notifications will be sent when leaks are detected.

Developers should check whether Gemini (Generative Language API) is enabled on their projects and audit all API keys in their environment to determine if any are publicly exposed, and rotate them immediately.

The researchers also suggest using the TruffleHog open-source tool to detect live, exposed keys in code and repositories.

[11] BleepingComputer - Trend Micro warns of critical Apex One code execution flaws
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Thu, 26 Feb 2026 12:58:28 -0500

[TAM METİN - 415 kelime]
Japanese cybersecurity software firm Trend Micro has patched two critical Apex One vulnerabilities that allow attackers to gain remote code execution (RCE) on vulnerable Windows systems.

Apex One is an endpoint security platform that detects and responds to security threats, including malware, spyware, malicious tools, and vulnerabilities.

The first critical Apex One security flaw patched this week (CVE-2025-71210) is due to a path traversal weakness in the Trend Micro Apex One management console, allowing attackers without privileges to execute malicious code on unpatched systems.

The second, tracked as CVE-2025-71211, is another Apex One management console path traversal vulnerability, similar in scope to CVE-2025-71210 but affecting a different executable.

As Trend Micro explained in a Tuesday security advisory, successful exploitation requires attackers to "have access to the Trend Micro Apex One Management Console, so customers that have their console's IP address exposed externally should consider mitigating factors such as source restrictions if not already applied."

"Even though an exploit may require several specific conditions to be met, Trend Micro strongly encourages customers to update to the latest builds as soon as possible," it warned.

To address these critical security flaws, Trend Micro has patched the vulnerabilities in the SaaS Apex One versions and released Critical Patch Build 14136, which also fixes two high-severity privilege escalation flaws in the Windows agent and four more affecting the macOS agent.

While Trend Micro has not flagged these vulnerabilities as exploited in the wild, threat actors have abused other Apex One in attacks over the last several years.

For instance, Trend Micro warned customers to patch an actively exploited Apex One RCE vulnerability (CVE-2025-54948) in August 2025, and addressed two other Apex One zero-days exploited in the wild in September 2022 (CVE-2022-40139) and in September 2023 (CVE-2023-41179).

The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) currently tracks 10 Trend Micro Apex vulnerabilities that have either been or are still being exploited in the wild.

[TAM METİN - 480 kelime]
DIY store chain ManoMano is notifying customers of a data breach that was caused by hackers compromising a third-party service provider.

The company confirmed to BleepingComputer that it learned of the hack in January 2026. An investigation into the incident determined that 38 million individuals are affected.

“We can confirm that ManoMano has recently notified customers about a security incident involving one of our third-party customer service providers (a subcontractor),” the company told BleepingComputer.

“In January 2026, we identified unauthorized access linked to this provider, which resulted in the unauthorized extraction of certain personal data associated with customer accounts and customer service interactions.”

ManoMano is a French e-commerce firm operating an online marketplace specializing in DIY, home improvement, gardening, and related products. It operates in France, Belgium, Spain, Italy, Germany, and the United Kingdom, and its e-stores reportedly have 50 million unique visitors per month.

Earlier this month, someone using the alias “Indra” claimed the ManoMano attack on a hacker forum, alleging that they were holding details on 37.8 million user accounts, as well as thousands of support tickets and attachments.

According to unconfirmed reports, the compromised organization was a Tunis-based customer support service provider that suffered a Zendesk breach.

Cybersecurity firm Hackmanac posted that ManoMano started notifying customers this week that their data had been stolen.

A spokesperson of ManoMano explained to BleepingComputer that the exposed information varies per individual, depending on the type of interactions they had with the platform. Exposed data types include:

Customer service communications

ManoMano emphasizes that no account passwords were accessed and that no data modifications occurred on the company’s systems.

“Upon discovery, we took immediate steps to secure our environment, including disabling the relevant access, revoking the subcontractor’s access to customer data, and strengthening access controls and monitoring,” said a ManoMano spokesperson.

“We also notified the relevant authorities, including the CNIL and ANSSI, and informed impacted customers with guidance to remain vigilant against phishing and social engineering attempts.”

The notification sample ManoMano shared with BleepingComputer contains recommendations for customers, including verifying incoming communications and sender identity, monitoring bank accounts for fraudulent transactions, and avoiding clicking on suspicious links or downloading email attachments.

ManoMano notes that the investigation is ongoing and that they cannot share additional technical details at this stage.

[TAM METİN - 492 kelime]
A critical vulnerability in the Junos OS Evolved network operating system running on PTX Series routers from Juniper Networks could allow an unauthenticated attacker to execute code remotely with root privileges.

PTX Series routers are high-performance core and peering routers built for high throughput, low latency, and scale. They are commonly used by internet service providers, telecommunication services, and cloud network applications.

The security issue is identified as CVE-2026-21902 and is caused by incorrect permission assignment in the ‘On-Box Anomaly Detection’ framework, which should be exposed to internal processes only over the internal routing interface.

However, the glitch allows accessing the framework over an externally exposed port, Juniper Networks explains in a security advisory.

Because the service runs as root and is enabled by default, successful exploitation would allow an attacker who is already on the network to take full control of the device without authentication.

The issue affects Junos OS Evolved versions before 25.4R1-S1-EVO and 25.4R2-EVO, on PTX Series routers. Older versions may also be impacted, but the vendor does not assess releases that have reached the end-of-engineering or end-of-life (EoL) phase.

Versions before 25.4R1-EVO, and standard (non-Evolved) Junos OS versions are not impacted by CVE-2026-21902. Juniper Networks has delivered fixes in versions 25.4R1-S1-EVO, 25.4R2-EVO, and 26.2R1-EVO of the product.

Juniper's Security Incident Response Team (SIRT) states that it was not aware of malicious exploitation of the vulnerability at the time of publishing the security bulletin.

If immediate patching is not possible, the vendor's recommendation is to restrict access to the vulnerable endpoints to trusted networks only using firewall filters or Access Control Lists (ACLs). Alternatively, administrators may disable the vulnerable service entirely using:

'request pfe anomalies disable'

Juniper Networks products are typically an attractive target for advanced hackers as the network equipment is used by service providers requiring high bandwidth, such as cloud data centers and large enterprises.

In March 2025, it was revealed that Chinese cyber-espionage actors were deploying custom backdoors on EoL Junos OS MX routers to drop a set of ‘TinyShell’ backdoor variants.

In January 2025, a malware campaign dubbed ‘J-magic’ targeted Juniper VPN gateways used in the semiconductor, energy, manufacturing, and IT sectors, deploying network-sniffing malware that activated upon receiving a “magic packet.”

In December 2024, Juniper Networks Smart routers became targets of Mirai botnet campaigns, getting enlisted in distributed denial of service (DDoS) swarms.

[TAM METİN - 497 kelime]
French professional football club Olympique de Marseille has confirmed a cyberattack after a threat actor claimed on Monday that it breached the club's systems earlier this month.

Founded 126 years ago, Olympique Marseille competes in the Ligue 1, the top tier of the French football league system, and was the first French club to win the UEFA Champions League in 1993.

On Tuesday, Olympique Marseille issued a statement confirming that it had been hit by a cyberattack, following claims by a threat actor that they had breached some of its servers.

The threat actor has also leaked a sample of the allegedly stolen information on a hacking forum, claiming to have stolen a database containing Olympique Marseille staff and supporter information.

"Olympique de Marseille has announced that it was recently the target of an attempted cyberattack, in a national and international context marked by a resurgence of attacks targeting large organizations," the football club said.

"Thanks to the immediate mobilization of our technical teams and specialized service providers, the situation was quickly brought under control. To date, all our activities are continuing as normal and in complete security, and we are continuing our investigations into the scope of the incident. The club would like to reassure its supporters that no banking details or passwords have been compromised."

While Olympique Marseille didn't provide further details about the incident, the threat actor says the stolen database contains information on 400,000 individuals, including their names, addresses, order information, email addresses, and mobile phone numbers.

​They added that the allegedly stolen data also includes information on more than 2,050 Drupal CMS accounts, including 34 OM staff and 1,770 contributors and moderators.

"Today I am selling Olympique de Marseille (OM) dump from feb 2026, iconic french football club in Ligue 1, online boutique for merch, fan memberships, massive supporter base in france and worldwide," the threat actor said.

Although Olympique Marseille has yet to confirm a data breach, it reported the incident to the French data protection authority (CNIL), filed a complaint, and advised fans to "remain vigilant against phishing attempts, and report any suspicious activity."

An Olympique Marseille spokesperson was not immediately available for comment when contacted by BleepingComputer earlier today.

In November, the French Football Federation (FFF) also disclosed a data breach after attackers gained access to administrative management software used by football clubs using a compromised account.

[TAM METİN - 603 kelime]
The number of ransomware victims paying threat actors has dropped to 28% last year, an all-time low, despite a significant increase in the number of claimed attacks.

A downward payment trend has been observed for the past four consecutive years by the blockchain intelligence platform Chainalysis.

At the moment, the total of on-chain ransomware payments in 2025 stands at $820 million, but the company notes that "the 2025 total is likely to approach or exceed $900 million as we attribute more events and payments."

Chainalysis reports a relative stability in the total number of payments, despite a 50% increase of ransomware attacks year-over-year.

In 2024, the payment rate recorded by Chainalysis was more than double, at 62.8%, while in 2022, it was at 78.9%.

Data from Chainalysis also aligns with previous reports by Coveware, which showed a steady decline in victim payment rates throughout 2025.

According to the blockchain company, some of the factors that influenced the ransomware economy include improved incident response, regulatory scrutiny, international law enforcement actions, and market fragmentation.

Current Chainalysis data shows that while aggregate revenue from ransomware activity declined, the median ransom payment rose significantly, up 368% from $12,738 in 2024 to $59,556 in 2025.

This indicates that ransomware victims pay larger amounts for the hope that cybercriminals will delete the stolen data and not sell it to other threat actors or trade it.

In 2025, the analysts observed 85 active extortion groups, far higher compared to previous years, when the ransomware space was dominated by a small number of threat groups and RaaS platforms.

A few high-impact incidents Chainalysis highlights in its report include the attack at Jaguar Land Rover, which inflicted an estimated $2.5 billion in damages, the Marks & Spencer breach by the Scattered Spider threat group, and the DaVita Inc. ransomware breach that exposed 2.7 million patient records.

For another year, the most targeted country was the United States, followed by Canada, Germany, and the U.K., showing threat actors’ preference for concentrating their efforts in developed economies.

Initial access brokers (IABs), hackers who sell access to compromised endpoints to ransomware operators, reportedly made $14 million in 2025, roughly the same as last year. This is only 1.7% of the total ransomware revenue last year, though initial access is a key enabler.

Analysis shows that spikes in IAB payment inflows are followed by increases in ransomware payments and victim leak posts roughly 30 days later, suggesting IAB activity can act as a leading indicator.

The average price for network access declined from approximately $1,427 in Q1 2023 to just $439 in Q1 2026, indicating that automation, AI-assisted tooling, and oversupply from info-stealer logs have shaped the industry.

Chainalysis says that although ransom payments declined last year, the scale, sophistication, and real-world impact of ransomware attacks continued to grow, impacting organizations of all sizes and backgrounds globally.

The researchers believe ransomware is going through a phase of adaptation, rather than losing the fight, evolving tactics to extract more value from an ever-decreasing number of consenting victims.

[16] BleepingComputer - Microsoft expands Windows restore to more enterprise devices
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Thu, 26 Feb 2026 08:04:02 -0500

Microsoft now allows more enterprise users to restore their personal settings and Microsoft Store apps from a previous Windows 11 device.

The feature, known as the first sign-in restore experience, is part of Windows Backup for Organizations, an enterprise-grade backup tool that helps simplify backups and migrate to Windows 11 more easily.

It allows users who sign in to a new or reimaged Windows 11 device with a Microsoft Entra ID account to restore their previous settings and Microsoft Store app list on first login, even if they missed the option during the device's initial setup.

This restore functionality was previously limited to devices joined to Microsoft Entra, the company's cloud-based identity platform. With this update, Microsoft extends support to hybrid-managed environments, multi-user device setups, and Windows 365 Cloud PCs, broadening its reach across a wider range of enterprise deployment scenarios.

"This allows users to restore Windows settings, restore their Microsoft Store app list, or choose to configure the device as new," Microsoft said on Tuesday.

"This feature extends restore capabilities beyond Microsoft Entra-joined devices to support hybrid-managed environments, improving readiness for new or reimaged Windows 11 devices."

When a user logs into an eligible device for the first time, a prompt will appear offering the option to restore from a previous device's backup or set up the device as new. Users who deliberately skip the restore step during initial device setup will not be prompted again.

​The Windows first sign-in restore feature is managed through existing Windows Backup for Organizations policies and can be configured using Microsoft Intune or Group Policy, allowing IT administrators to deploy it without learning new tools.

Microsoft noted that the feature is particularly useful for organizations migrating to Windows 11 or those that go through frequent hardware refreshes, and added that admins will retain full control over which devices and users the restore experience applies to.

"General availability begins with devices that have installed Windows updates released February 24, 2026, and later. The experience is controlled by admins and governed by existing Windows Backup for Organizations policies," Microsoft said.

Windows Backup for Organizations was first announced at the Microsoft Ignite conference in November 2024 as an opt-in feature disabled by default, reaching public preview in May 2025 and general availability in August.

[17] BleepingComputer - New York sues Valve for promoting illegal gambling via game loot boxes
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[TAM METİN - 521 kelime]
New York Attorney General Letitia James sued video game developer and publisher Valve Corporation for using game loot boxes to facilitate illegal gambling activities among children and teenagers.

Valve operates Steam, one of the largest digital game distribution services in the world, offering access to thousands of games for millions of users worldwide. At the time this article was published, Steam was reporting over 29 million players online, with nearly 7.5 million playing a game.

Attorney General James said the gaming giant is violating the state's gambling laws by offering players the opportunity to win random virtual prizes that can be exchanged for real money, in a process described as being similar to a slot machine.

"Illegal gambling can be harmful and lead to serious addiction problems, especially for our young people," said James. "Valve has made billions of dollars by letting children and adults alike illegally gamble for the chance to win valuable virtual prizes. These features are addictive, harmful, and illegal, and my office is suing to stop Valve's illegal conduct and protect New Yorkers."

The lawsuit targets loot boxes in Counter-Strike 2, Team Fortress 2, and Dota 2 that award players with random items, such as weapon skins or character accessories. However, the odds of winning rare items are allegedly deliberately skewed by Valve to make them far more valuable, leading the total value of market items to balloon to an estimated $4.3 billion as of March 2025, according to Attorney General James.

Some individual items (such as AK-47 skins) have even fetched prices of over $1 million, making Steam accounts a frequent target for hackers and scammers.

The lawsuit also highlights the potential harm to children, as they may be drawn into loot box purchases to win rare items and boost social status within gaming communities. "Children who are introduced to gambling are four times more likely to develop a gambling problem later in life than those who are not," according to research cited in the Wednesday press release.

Attorney General James has asked the court to permanently bar Valve from operating loot box features in the state, to require the company to return all profits generated by the practice, and to impose fines for the alleged violations.

In January 2025, Genshin Impact developer Cognosphere (aka Hoyoverse) agreed to pay $20 million to settle a U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) lawsuit over unfair marketing of loot boxes to minors, obscuring the actual costs. andmisleading the players about the odds of winning prizes.

BleepingComputer reached out to a Valve spokesperson for comment, but a response was not immediately available.

[TAM METİN - 458 kelime]
American manufacturer of medical devices, UFP Technologies, has disclosed that a cybersecurity incident has compromised its IT systems and data.

UFP Technologies is a publicly traded medical engineering and manufacturing company that produces a broad range of devices and components used in surgery, wound care, implants, orthopedic applications, and healthcare wearables.

The company employs 4,300 people, has an annual revenue of $600 million, and a market cap of $1.86 billion, according to recent data.

In a filing submitted yesterday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), UFP Technologies disclosed that it detected suspicious activity on its IT systems on February 14.

The firm immediately deployed isolation and remediation measures and engaged external cybersecurity advisors to help with the investigation.

Preliminary results of the investigation indicate that the threat has been removed, but the hacker was able to steal data from compromised systems.

“Through the Company’s efforts, the Company believes that the third party responsible for this cybersecurity incident has been removed from the Company’s IT systems, and the Company’s ability to access information impacted by this incident has been restored in all material respects,” reads the SEC filing.

“The incident appears to have impacted many but not all of the Company’s IT systems and affected functions such as billing and label making for customer deliveries. Certain Company or Company-related data appear to have been stolen or destroyed.”

The data destruction note suggests a ransomware or wiper attack, although the nature of the malware remains unclear.

BleepingComputer has contacted UFP Technologies to ask about the attack and whether it involved data encryption/ransom payment demands, but a comment wasn’t immediately available.

At the time of publishing, no ransomware group has publicly claimed the attack on UFP Technologies.

UFP Technologies mentioned that, at this time, it has not determined whether personal information has been exfiltrated. If confirmed at a later time, notifications will be sent to impacted individuals as required by law.

The company stated that, despite the cybersecurity incident, its primary IT systems remain operational. Based on current evidence and assessments, UFP Technologies states it is unlikely that the incident will have a material impact on its operations or financials.

[19] BleepingComputer - Fake Next.js job interview tests backdoor developer's devices
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Wed, 25 Feb 2026 16:47:12 -0500

[TAM METİN - 578 kelime]
A coordinated campaign targeting software developers with job-themed lures is using malicious repositories posing as legitimate Next.js projects and technical assessment materials, including recruiting coding tests.

The attacker's goal is to achieve remote code execution (RCE) on developer machines, exfiltrate sensitive data, and introduce additional payloads on compromised systems.

Next.js is a popular JavaScript framework used for building web applications. It runs on top of React and uses Node.js for the backend.

The Microsoft Defender team says that the attacker created fake web app projects built with Next.js and disguised them as coding projects to share with developers during job interviews or technical assessments.

The researchers initially identified a repository hosted on the Bitbucket cloud-based Git-based code hosting and collaboration service. However, they discovered multiple repositories that shared code structure, loader logic, and naming patterns.

When the target clones the repository and opens it locally, following a standard workflow, they trigger malicious JavaScript that executes automatically when launching the app.

The script downloads additional malicious code (a JavaScript backdoor) from the attacker's server and executes it directly in memory with the running Node.js process, allowing remote code execution on the machine.

To increase the infection rate, the attackers embedded multiple execution triggers within the malicious repositories, Microsoft explained. These are summarized as follows:

VS Code trigger – A .vscode/tasks.json file set with runOn: "folderOpen" executes a Node script as soon as the project folder is opened (and trusted).

Dev server trigger – When the developer runs npm run dev, a trojanized asset (e.g., a modified JS library) decodes a hidden URL, fetches a loader from a remote server, and executes it in memory.

Backend startup trigger – On server start, a backend module decodes a base64 endpoint from .env, sends process.env to the attacker, receives JavaScript in response, and executes it using new Function().

The infection process drops a JavaScript payload (Stage 1) that profiles the host and registers with a command-and-control (C2) endpoint, polling the server at fixed intervals.

The infection then upgrades to a tasking controller (Stage 2) that connects to a separate C2 server, checks for tasks, executes supplied JavaScript in memory, and tracks spawned processes. The payload also supports file enumeration, directory browsing, and staged file exfiltration.

Microsoft found that the campaign involved multiple repositories that shared naming conventions, loader structure, and staging infrastructure, indicating a coordinated effort rather than a one-off attack.

Aside from the technical analysis, the researchers did not provide any details about the attacker or the extent of the operation.

The tech giant advises that developers should treat standard workflows as the high-risk attack surfaces they really are and take appropriate precautions.

The recommended mitigations include enforcing VS Code Workspace Trust/Restricted Mode, using Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) rules, and monitoring risky sign-ins with Entra ID Protection.

Secrets stored on developer endpoints should be minimized, and short-lived tokens with the least required privileges should be used where possible.

[20] Security Affairs - How AI Aids Incident Response: Why Humans Alone Cannot Do IR Efficiently

How AI Aids Incident Response: Why Humans Alone Cannot Do IR Efficiently

AI accelerates incident response by correlating alerts and generating reports in minutes, helping teams scale beyond manual limits.

Incident response has always been a race against the clock. It starts ticking the moment an alert is triggered, and each minute thereafter can lead to lost revenue, regulatory exposure, reputational damage, or customer churn.

Traditionally, incident response has relied on highly skilled analysts manually switching between tools, correlating logs, validating alerts, escalating findings, and drafting executive reports. It’s meticulous work, which is expensive and slow.

Not by replacing humans, but by removing the friction that makes human-led investigation inefficient in the first place.

The Time and Cost of Traditional Incident Response

According to Prophet Security, a leading provider of AI SOC solutions, a typical security investigation can take around 10-20 minutes, depending on severity. Complex incidents (particularly those involving cloud, SaaS, and hybrid infrastructure) can take many days.

Analysts have to manually query SIEM platforms, pull endpoint telemetry, check threat intelligence feeds, and correlate identity logs. They also have to validate suspicious behavior, and draft reports for management. They do all of this again and again.

People get tired. They context-switch. They miss correlations buried in millions of log entries. They operate within limited working hours. AI does not.

An AI-enabled incident response capability can begin investigating the moment an alert is generated.

It can immediately pull contextual data from multiple tools, cross-reference threat intelligence feeds, analyze behavioral patterns, compare activity to historical baselines, assign risk ratings, and produce formatted summaries for stakeholders. What might take an analyst many hours to complete, can be delivered in minutes with an AI-enabled tool. This can often be due to complicated integrations with other tools used in the network, but with the use of those tools, the time to discovery can be decreased significantly.

That speed improves efficiency and changes the entire operating model of a SOC.

What Most Teams Don’t Realize About AI Investigation

Here’s something many security leaders underestimate: An AI investigation can aggregate and correlate data across systems faster than any team of people because it operates across tools simultaneously.

Instead of manually pivoting from your SIEM to your EDR to your identity provider to your cloud logs, AI can ingest and analyze them in parallel. It can pull data from a host of sources, such as endpoint telemetry, identity and access logs, network flow data, cloud workload logs, email security alerts, and threat intelligence feeds.

Within seconds, it can identify relationships that would take a human hours to uncover, and it does so consistently.

There are no skipped steps, fatigue, or variation in the process.

Faster Answers for the People Who Matter

Security teams don’t just investigate incidents, they answer questions, from CISOs, the board, customers, watchdogs, and the press.

“What is the business impact?”

“What’s our exposure?”

In a traditional model, generating a structured executive summary can take almost as long as the technical investigation itself. With AI, this all changes.

Modern AI-driven incident response platforms can generate structured executive reports, technical deep dives, risk ratings, escalation recommendations, clear timelines, and recommended containment steps. Even better, they can deliver them formatted to your specification.

This runs contrary to a common belief that AI outputs are vague or incomplete. In reality, when properly configured and integrated with your environment, AI can deliver faster, clearer answers than a human-first process because it’s drawing from complete telemetry in real time.

Why Humans Alone Cannot Scale Incident Response

The volume of alerts continues to grow. Cloud expansion, SaaS sprawl, remote work, and AI-driven threats all increase signal volume.

Yet SOC headcount doesn’t scale at the same rate.

There are three reasons human-only incident response falls short:

Cognitive Limits: Analysts can only process so much information at once. Correlating multi-source logs across distributed infrastructure is mentally demanding.

Fatigue and Burnout: Incident response is high-pressure work. Repetitive triage leads to alert fatigue. Mistakes increase under stress.

Time Constraints: Humans work within a shift cycle, but bad actors do not. With AI, this is no longer a concern. AI systems can work 24/7 without impacting performance, remembering previous incidents, or losing context between shifts.

This doesn’t mean taking humans out of the loop but rather promoting them to higher-level tasks.

AI and the Modern Incident Response Lifecycle

AI-based incident response also fits well with existing models, such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s SP 800-61 incident handling model.

The classic lifecycle follows the path of preparation, detection, containment, eradication, recovery, and lessons learned. AI enhances all of these stages.

AI models continuously analyze performance metrics, anomalies, and behavioral drift, especially critical in AI-powered systems that suffer from probabilistic failure modes such as model drift or hallucination.

Traditional IT monitoring wasn’t designed for these scenarios. AI-driven detection can identify subtle degradation patterns before humans notice them.

Once an incident is identified, AI can suggest containment steps, such as traffic throttling, model rollback, feature flag disablement, API rate limiting and account isolation.

It can also model impact scenarios before running them.

This is where AI delivers the greatest efficiency gains, as it can reconstruct timelines, compare model versions, detect data drift, and annotate adversarial behaviors to frameworks such as MITRE ATLAS. It can also point out demographic disparities in decisioning systems.

Instead of manually interrogating models and logs, analysts review AI-generated findings and validate conclusions.

Reporting And Compliance

For organizations operating under emerging AI regulations (such as the EU AI Act) incident documentation is critical.

AI can automatically generate structured reports that include the nature of the incident and its severity; affected systems; remediation actions; and the timeline.

That means faster regulatory reporting and stronger audit readiness.

What Enabling AI Incident Response Requires

AI is not a solo operation. For it to optimize processes effectively, it requires:

Security tool integration

Threat intelligence feed access

Escalation procedures

Baselines for monitoring

This means that AI needs to be operationalized, not just implemented.

SOC teams looking to make this transition should assess current data sources and look for integration points, develop standardized alert taxonomies and severity levels, and develop reporting requirements for executives and regulators. They also need to implement human validation points, and train analysts to monitor AI results instead of creating everything by hand.

It’s not about taking jobs away from analysts. It’s about reworking processes to have AI correlate data and generate reports, and have humans make decisions.

AI Incident Response for AI Systems

There’s another layer to consider. AI incident response must address the unique failure modes of probabilistic systems.

Unlike traditional software, AI systems can fail due to the following reasons:

These failures may not always be visible as outages, but can be visible as accuracy degradation or bias. Humans alone cannot identify subtle statistical anomalies in millions of predictions.

AI systems, on the other hand, are capable of monitoring accuracy thresholds, fairness scores, drift scores, and confidence distributions.

The Human Investment Required

However, there are costs involved in making the transition to AI-powered incident response. These include the costs of integration engineering, governance frameworks, monitoring infrastructure, and the cost of training analysts.

However, the human effort required on an ongoing basis drops significantly. Rather than spending hours gathering evidence, analysts can read summaries generated by AI in minutes. Instead of writing board-ready reports from scratch, they simply verify structured reports. While once they were correlating tools manually, they now supervise automated investigations.

The result is not fewer humans, but more effective ones.

The Bigger Question: How Fast Do You Need Answers?

Here’s the behavioral shift security leaders should consider:

How soon do you have to be able to give the right answers to your board, customers, regulators, or media after an incident occurs? Is it hours, days, or minutes?

In a world where AI can start investigating right away and come up with structured results in minutes, it becomes a competitive disadvantage to not be using AI.

AI does not substitute human judgment. It speeds up discovery, enables structured reporting, fights fatigue, improves consistency, and boosts efficiency.

Humans are still vital, but they cannot by themselves scale incident response in today’s world.

The future SOC is not AI versus analysts. It is AI doing the heavy lifting of data analysis, pattern identification, and reporting, and analysts bringing their expertise, values, and strategic thinking.

Incident response will always need intelligent people.

But with AI, those people can finally operate at the speed the business demands.

[21] Security Affairs - 12 Million exposed .env files reveal widespread security failures

12 Million exposed .env files reveal widespread security failures

Mysterium VPN found 12M IPs exposing .env files, leaking credentials and revealing widespread security misconfigurations worldwide.

Configuration mistakes rarely trigger alarms. A forgotten deny rule, an overlooked server setting, or a full project folder uploaded to production can quietly expose a company’s most sensitive secrets. In many cases, those secrets live inside simple environment files known as .env files.

Researchers at Mysterium VPN identified 12,088,677 IP addresses serving publicly accessible .env-style files.

“Researchers here at Mysterium VPN identified over 12 million IP addresses with publicly accessible .env-style files, revealing credentials and tokens, including JWT signing keys, API keys, database passwords, and service tokens.” reads the report published by Mysterium VPN. “The United States leads the count with nearly 2.8 million exposed IPs, accounting for around 23% of the total IP pool. The issue is global: Japan (1.1M), Germany (777K), India (652K), France (636K), and the UK (583K) also have substantial exposures, showing that this is a global security hygiene problem.”

These files exposed database credentials, API keys, JWT signing secrets, cloud tokens, and other sensitive values. The scale reveals a widespread operational hygiene problem affecting organizations across industries and regions.

A .env file stores key-value pairs that applications load at startup. Developers use them for database URLs, OAuth secrets, SMTP credentials, cloud access keys, and third-party tokens. The format stays simple and convenient. That same simplicity creates risk. If a server allows access to hidden files, anyone can request “/.env” and download live credentials without exploiting a vulnerability.

Attackers who retrieve these secrets skip the break-in phase entirely. They log in with valid credentials, query databases, forge authentication tokens, abuse APIs, or access cloud storage. OWASP guidance stresses strict secret control, rotation, auditing, and least-privilege scoping because exposed secrets often lead directly to compromise.

The exposure spans the globe. The United States accounts for nearly 2.8 million affected IPs, followed by Japan, Germany, India, France, the UK, Singapore, Ireland, Canada, and Australia. Large cloud and hosting footprints explain part of the distribution, but the pattern points to repeated deployment and configuration mistakes across ecosystems—not a single flawed platform.

The consequences can escalate quickly. Database credentials enable data theft and privilege escalation. API keys invite financial abuse and spam campaigns. Leaked JWT secrets allow attackers to forge tokens and hijack accounts. SMTP credentials open the door to phishing from legitimate domains. Cloud storage keys can expose backups, identity documents, and internal files.

These exposures usually stem from preventable errors: missing deny rules for hidden files, reverse proxies forwarding sensitive paths, static roots pointing to entire project directories, container images embedding secrets, or forgotten backup files such as .env.bak or .env.old. Attackers routinely scan for these predictable patterns.

When teams discover an exposed .env file, they must treat the event as a full security incident. Remove public access immediately, purge caches, and rotate every secret in the file. Invalidate tokens, review logs for suspicious access, and implement automated secret scanning in repositories and CI pipelines.

Long term, organizations need layered defenses. Block hidden and backup files at the server and CDN level. Move secrets out of web-accessible directories and into centralized secret management systems with audit logs and automated rotation. Scope keys to minimal permissions, enforce network restrictions, and adopt short-lived tokens. Deploy only approved artifacts and validate that no sensitive files remain publicly reachable.

The Mysterium VPN findings highlight a systemic issue: secret exposure continues at massive scale because teams treat configuration as an afterthought. Security teams must embed secret governance into development workflows, deployment pipelines, and infrastructure baselines. Without that shift, a single overlooked file will keep turning routine deployments into full-scale breaches.

ManoMano data breach impacted 38 Million customer accounts

European DIY platform ManoMano suffered a data breach via a third-party provider, exposing personal data of 38 million customers.

European DIY e-commerce platform ManoMano disclosed a major data breach affecting 38 million customers. Hackers accessed personal information by compromising a third-party service provider, prompting notifications and potential security measures for impacted users across multiple countries.

ManoMano is a European e-commerce platform specializing in DIY, home improvement, gardening, and tools. Founded in 2013, it connects consumers with a wide range of products—from power tools and plumbing supplies to outdoor furniture and gardening equipment—offered by multiple sellers, including brands and independent retailers.

ManoMano confirmed to BleepingComputer that it discovered a security breach in January 2026 affecting 38 million customers. The incident involved a third-party service provider, whose unauthorized access led to the extraction of personal data linked to customer accounts and service interactions. The company has notified affected users and is investigating the scope of the compromise.

“In January 2026, we identified unauthorized access linked to this provider, which resulted in the unauthorized extraction of certain personal data associated with customer accounts and customer service interactions.” the company told BleepingComputer.

According to the data breach notification sent to the impacted customers, the exposed data includes: first name, last name, email address, telephone number, and your eventual interactions with our customer service.

The company pointed out that user passwords were not compromised.

Upon detecting the breach, the company immediately blocked the compromised account and revoked the subcontractor’s access. Enhanced data access controls were implemented internally and for all subcontractors. Authorities, including CNIL, ANSSI, and the Cyber Emergency Île-de-France platform, were informed to ensure proper oversight and response.

“As soon as the incident was identified, we immediately took all necessary measures to protect your data.

The analyses conducted by our cyber security teams allowed for the quick identification of the compromised account, which was blocked on the same day the incident was discovered. Subsequently, we revoked all of our subcontractor’s access to our customers’ data.” reads the data breach notification sent to the impacted users.

“We have also implemented reinforced controls on data access, both within our company and at our other subcontractors. Finally, we informed the CNIL (French National Commission for Information Technology and Civil Liberties), the ANSSI (French National Agency for the Security of Information Systems) and the Cyber Emergency Île-de-France platform.”

Trend Micro fixes two critical flaws in Apex One

Trend Micro fixed two critical Apex One flaws enabling remote code execution on vulnerable Windows systems and urged immediate updates.

Trend Micro has addressed two critical vulnerabilities in Apex One that could allow attackers to achieve remote code execution on affected Windows systems. The company released security updates and strongly urged customers to apply the patches promptly to prevent potential exploitation and protect their environments from compromise.

Trend Micro Apex One is an all-in-one advanced endpoint security solution. It provides ransomware protection, zero-day threat defense, EDR, predictive machine learning, DLP, and virtual patching via a single agent.

The first vulnerability addressed by the security firm is a Console Directory Traversal Remote Code Execution issue tracked as CVE-2025-71210 (CVSS score of 9.8).

“A vulnerability in the Trend Micro Apex One management console could allow a remote attacker to upload malicious code and execute commands on affected installations.” reads the advisory. “For this particular vulnerability, an attacker must have access to the Trend Micro Apex One Management Console, so customers that have their console’s IP address exposed externally should consider mitigating factors such as source restrictions if not already applied.”

The second vulnerability fixed by the company is a Console Directory Traversal Remote Code Execution issue, tracked as CVE-2025-71211 (CVSS score of 9.8). The report states that the vulnerability is similar in scope to CVE-2025-71210 but impacts a different executable.

“A vulnerability in the Trend Micro Apex One management console could allow a remote attacker to upload malicious code and execute commands on affected installations. This vulnerability is similar in scope to CVE-2025-71210 but affects a different executable.” reads the report. “For this particular vulnerability, an attacker must have access to the Trend Micro Apex One Management Console, so customers that have their console’s IP address exposed externally should consider mitigating factors such as source restrictions if not already applied.”

The researchers Jacky Hsieh and Charles Yang @ CoreCloud Tech reported both flaws through the TrendAI’s Zero Day Initiative. The SaaS versions have already been mitigated, and no customer action is required.

Trend Micro addressed the vulnerabilities in the SaaS Apex One versions and released Critical Patch Build 14136.

The company also fixes two high-severity privilege escalation flaws (CVE-2025-71212: Scan Engine Link Following Local Privilege Escalation Vulnerability, CVE-2025-71213: Origin Validation Error Local Privilege Escalation Vulnerability) in the Windows agent and four issues impacting the macOS agent.

The cybersecurity firm did not reveal if these vulnerabilities have been exploited in attacks in the wild.

[24] Security Affairs - UAT-10027 campaign hits U.S. education and healthcare with stealthy Dohdoor backdoor

UAT-10027 campaign hits U.S. education and healthcare with stealthy Dohdoor backdoor

UAT-10027 campaign is targeting U.S. education and healthcare sectors to deploy a new Dohdoor backdoor.

Cisco Talos has identified a new threat cluster, tracked as UAT-10027, targeting U.S. education and healthcare organizations since at least December 2025 to deploy a previously unseen backdoor named Dohdoor.

Initial access likely occurs through phishing, triggering a PowerShell script that downloads a batch file and then a malicious DLL named Dohdoor via sideloading. The malware uses DNS-over-HTTPS and Cloudflare infrastructure to hide its command-and-control traffic within legitimate HTTPS connections. This allows attackers to deploy additional payloads, such as Cobalt Strike, directly into memory while evading security detection and maintaining persistent access.

Attackers used PowerShell to run curl with an encoded URL, downloading a malicious .bat or .cmd file—likely delivered through phishing. The batch script then created a hidden folder in ProgramData or Public, downloaded a disguised malicious DLL, and used DLL sideloading with legitimate Windows executables to run it. Finally, it performed anti-forensic actions, clearing Run history, wiping the clipboard, and deleting itself to reduce traces of compromise.

UAT-10027 deployed a 64-bit DLL loader, Dohdoor, compiled in November 2025, to download, decrypt, and run payloads inside legitimate Windows processes. Dohdoor resolves Windows APIs through hash-based lookups, parses command-line arguments from the sideloaded executable, and extracts the C2 URL and payload path. It uses DNS-over-HTTPS to query Cloudflare over port 443, builds crafted HTTP requests, and parses JSON responses by searching for “Answer” and “data” fields to obtain the C2 IP address.

After resolving the server, Dohdoor sends HTTPS GET requests that mimic curl traffic and retrieves an encrypted payload. It decrypts the payload with a custom XOR-SUB algorithm using SIMD routines for 16-byte blocks and a position-dependent formula for remaining bytes.

“Dohdoor receives an encrypted payload from the C2 server. The encrypted payload undergoes custom XOR-SUB decryption using a position-dependent cipher. The encrypted data maintains a 4:1 expansion ratio where the encrypted data is four times larger than the decrypted data.” reads Talos’s report.”The decryption routine of Dohdoor operates in two ways. A vectorized (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) SIMD method for bulk processing and a simpler loop to handle the remaining encrypted data.  “

The loader then performs process hollowing, injecting the decrypted payload into suspended Windows binaries such as OpenWith.exe or wksprt.exe before resuming execution.

To evade EDR, Dohdoor locates ntdll.dll, checks NtProtectVirtualMemory for user-mode hooks, and patches the syscall stub to create a direct syscall trampoline.

“Dohdoor achieves this by locating ntdll.dll with the hash “0x28cc” and finds NtProtectVirtualMemory with the hash “0xbc46c894”.” continues the report. “Then it reads the first 32 bytes of the function using ReadProcessMemory that dynamically loads during the execution and compares them with the syscall stub pattern in hexadecimal “4C 8B D1 B8 FF 00 00 00” which corresponds to the assembly instructions “mov r10, rcx; mov eax, 0FFh”. If the byte pattern matches, it writes a 6-byte patch in hexadecimal “B8 BB 00 00 00 C3” which corresponds to assembly instruction “mov eax, 0BBh; ret”, resulting in creating a direct syscall stub that bypasses any user mode hooks.”

Telemetry suggests the actor likely used a Cobalt Strike Beacon as the follow-on payload.

Talos assesses with low confidence that UAT-10027 links to North Korea due to overlaps with the Lazarus Group. Dohdoor shares traits with Lazarloader, including a custom XOR-SUB routine using the 0x26 constant and NTDLL unhooking for EDR evasion. The campaign also uses DoH via Cloudflare, DLL sideloading, process hollowing, and mixed-case TLDs—tradecraft seen in Lazarus operations.

“In addition to the observed technical characteristics similarities of the tools, the use of multiple top-level domains (TLDs) including “.design”, “. software”, and “. online”, with varying case patterns, also aligns with the operational preferences of Lazarus. While UAT-10027’s malware shares technical overlaps with the Lazarus Group, the campaign’s focus on the education and health care sectors deviates from Lazarus’ typical profile of cryptocurrency and defense targeting.” concludes the report. “However, Talos has historically seen that North Korean APT actors have targeted the health care sector using Maui ransomware, and another North Korean APT group, Kimsuky, has targeted the education sector, highlighting the overlaps in the victimology of UAT-10027 with that of other North Korean APTs. “

U.S. CISA adds Cisco SD-WAN flaws to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog

U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) adds Cisco SD-WAN flaws to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog.

The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) added two Cisco SD-WAN flaws to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog.

Below are the flaws added to the catalog:

CVE-2022-20775 Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Path Traversal Vulnerability

CVE-2026-20127 Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Controller and Manager Authentication Bypass Vulnerability

This week, Cisco warned of a critical Cisco SD-WAN vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2026-20127 (CVSS score of 10.0), which has been actively exploited since 2023. The flaw affects Catalyst SD-WAN Controller and Manager and allows remote, unauthenticated attackers to bypass authentication and gain full administrative access by sending a crafted request to vulnerable systems.

“This vulnerability exists because the peering authentication mechanism in an affected system is not working properly. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted requests to an affected system.” reads the advisory. “A successful exploit could allow the attacker to log in to an affected Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Controller as an internal, high-privileged, non-root user account. Using this account, the attacker could access NETCONF, which would then allow the attacker to manipulate network configuration for the SD-WAN fabric.”

The vulnerability impacts all Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN deployments, regardless of configuration. Affected environments include:

Cisco Hosted SD-WAN Cloud

Cisco Hosted SD-WAN Cloud – Cisco Managed

Cisco Hosted SD-WAN Cloud – FedRAMP

Cisco credited the Australian Signals Directorate’s Australian Cyber Security Centre (ASD-ACSC) for reporting the issue and is tracking related exploitation under the name UAT-8616, describing the actor as highly sophisticated.

The flaw has been fixed in updated Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN releases, including: 20.9.8.2, 20.12.5.3, 20.12.6.1, 20.15.4.2, and 20.18.2.1. Customers running versions prior to 20.9.1 are advised to migrate to a patched release.

Cisco Talos tracks the exploitation as UAT-8616, a highly sophisticated threat actor active since at least 2023. Investigators found the group likely downgraded software to escalate privileges to root, exploited CVE-2022-20775, and then restored the original version to maintain stealthy root access. The campaign highlights the ongoing targeting of network edge devices to gain persistent access to high-value and critical infrastructure organizations. Customers are urged to apply the security updates immediately.

“Talos clusters this exploitation and subsequent post-compromise activity as “UAT-8616” whom we assess with high confidence is a highly sophisticated cyber threat actor. After the discovery of active exploitation of the 0-day in the wild, we were able to find evidence that the malicious activity went back at least three years (2023).” reads the report published by Cisco Talos. “Investigation conducted by intelligence partners identified that the actor likely escalated to root user via a software version downgrade. The actor then reportedly exploited CVE-2022-20775 before restoring back to the original software version, effectively allowing them to gain root access.”

Cisco warns that internet-exposed Catalyst SD-WAN Controllers are at risk. Customers should review /var/log/auth.log for suspicious “Accepted publickey for vmanage-admin” entries from unknown IPs and verify them against authorized System IPs in the web UI. All control peering events, especially vManage, must be manually validated for unusual timing, IPs, or device roles. If compromise is suspected, open a TAC case and collect admin-tech files. There are no full workarounds; restricting ports 22 and 830 may help temporarily, but upgrading to a fixed release is strongly recommended.

Cisco PSIRT has confirmed limited real-world exploitation of the vulnerability and strongly urges customers to upgrade to a patched software version to address the issue.

CVE-2022-20775 is a privilege escalation vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco SD-WAN Software. It arises from improper access controls on certain CLI commands, allowing an authenticated local attacker to execute maliciously crafted commands. Successful exploitation lets the attacker run arbitrary commands with root privileges, potentially compromising the entire system. Cisco has released software updates to fix the issue, and no workarounds are available. More details can be found here.

According to Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities, FCEB agencies have to address the identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect their networks against attacks exploiting the flaws in the catalog.

Experts also recommend that private organizations review the Catalog and address the vulnerabilities in their infrastructure.

CISA urges federal agencies to fix the Dell RecoverPoint flaw by the end of this week, on February 21, while ordering the agencies to address the GitLab issue by February 27, 2026.

Google GTIG disrupted China-linked APT UNC2814 halting attacks on 53 orgs in 42 countries

Google and partners disrupted UNC2814, a suspected China-linked group that hacked 53 organizations across 42 countries.

Google, with industry partners, disrupted the infrastructure of UNC2814, a suspected China-linked cyber espionage group that breached at least 53 organizations in 42 countries. The group has been active since at least 2017, and was spotted targeting governments and global telecoms across Africa, Asia, and the Americas, making it a highly prolific and elusive threat. UNC2814 is likely linked to additional infections in more than 20 other nations.

“Last week, Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG), Mandiant, and partners took action to disrupt a global espionage campaign targeting telecommunications and government organizations in dozens of nations across four continents.” reads the GTIG’s report. “The threat actor, UNC2814, is a suspected People’s Republic of China (PRC)-nexus cyber espionage group that GTIG has tracked since 2017. “

UNC2814 used API calls to SaaS apps as command-and-control (C2) infrastructure, disguising malicious traffic as legitimate activity. Rather than exploiting product flaws, the group leveraged legitimate Google Sheets API functions through a novel backdoor called GRIDTIDE.

The group’s operations target different victims than other campaigns, such as “Salt Typhoon,” using unique techniques and TTPs.

Mandiant, using Google SecOps, detected suspicious activity on a CentOS server where the binary /var/tmp/xapt launched a root shell and ran id to confirm root access, showing the attacker had escalated privileges. The researchers reported that the payload mimicked a legacy Debian tool to avoid detection.

Post-compromise, the actor moved laterally via SSH, used living-off-the-land binaries for reconnaissance, and installed the GRIDTIDE backdoor for persistence via a systemd service. Attackers executed GRIDTIDE with nohup ./xapt to keep it running after session closure, and deployed SoftEther VPN Bridge to create an encrypted outbound connection.

UNC2814 targeted endpoints containing personally identifiable information (names, phone numbers, dates of birth, and national IDs) consistent with telecom-focused cyber espionage. While no direct exfiltration was observed, UNC2814 could leverage such access to monitor communications, including call records and SMS messages, for surveillance and intelligence-gathering purposes.

GRIDTIDE is a sophisticated C-based backdoor used by UNC2814 that can execute shell commands, upload and download files. The malware uses Google Sheets as a command-and-control (C2) channel, hiding malicious traffic within legitimate API requests. While it currently uses Google Sheets, other cloud-based spreadsheet platforms could be exploited in a similar way.

The backdoor requires a 16-byte cryptographic key on the host to decrypt its Google Drive configuration, which contains service account credentials, spreadsheet IDs, and private keys.

“When executed, GRIDTIDE sanitizes its Google Sheet. It does this by deleting the first 1000 rows, across columns A to Z in the spreadsheet, by using the Google Sheets API batchClear method. This prevents previous commands or file data stored in the Sheet from interfering with the threat actor’s current session.” continues the report. “Once the Sheet is prepared, the backdoor conducts host-based reconnaissance. It fingerprints the endpoint by collecting the victim’s username, endpoint name, OS details, local IP address, and environmental data such as the current working directory, language settings, and local time zone.”

Commands from the attacker follow a structured syntax, allowing execution of Bash commands, file uploads, and downloads, with status responses returned to cell A1. Data transfer occurs via cells A2 to An, and the malware uses URL-safe Base64 encoding to evade detection.

UNC2814 has leveraged GRIDTIDE since at least 2017 to target telecommunications and government organizations worldwide.

Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) and its partners terminated all attacker-controlled Google Cloud Projects and accounts, disabled the UNC2814 infrastructure, and revoked access to Google Sheets API calls.

GTIG took coordinated action to disrupt UNC2814 and protect affected organizations. They terminated all attacker-controlled Cloud Projects, disabling GRIDTIDE backdoor access, and took down known UNC2814 infrastructure, including current and historical domains. Attacker accounts and Google Sheets access were revoked, and victim organizations were formally notified and supported. GTIG also refined detection signatures to block GRIDTIDE activity and released indicators of compromise (IOCs) used by UNC2814 since 2023, helping organizations worldwide identify and defend against this threat.

“The global scope of UNC2814’s activity, evidenced by confirmed or suspected operations in over 70 countries, underscores the serious threat facing telecommunications and government sectors, and the capacity for these intrusions to evade detection by defenders.” concludes the report. “Prolific intrusions of this scale are generally the result of years of focused effort and will not be easily re-established. We expect that UNC2814 will work hard to re-establish their global footprint.”

Untrusted repositories turn Claude code into an attack vector

Flaws in Anthropic’s Claude Code could allow remote code execution and theft of API keys when users open untrusted repositories.

Check Point Research team found multiple vulnerabilities in Anthropic’s Claude Code AI coding assistant that could lead to remote code execution and API key theft. The vulnerabilities abuse features such as Hooks, MCP servers, and environment variables to run arbitrary shell commands and exfiltrate Anthropic API credentials when users clone and open untrusted repositories.

“Critical vulnerabilities, CVE-2025-59536 and CVE-2026-21852, in Anthropic’s Claude Code enabled remote code execution and API key theft through malicious repository-level configuration files, triggered simply by cloning and opening an untrusted project.” reads the report published by Check Point Research.

“Built-in mechanisms—including Hooks, MCP integrations, and environment variables—could be abused to bypass trust controls, execute hidden shell commands, and redirect authenticated API traffic before user consent”

Researchers found that Claude Code’s project-level configuration files can act as an execution layer, allowing the attackers to abuse a single malicious repository as an attack vector. Simply cloning and opening a crafted repo could trigger hidden commands, bypass consent safeguards, steal Anthropic API keys, and pivot from a developer’s workstation into shared enterprise cloud environments, without visible warning.

The risks include silent command execution via abused Hooks, consent bypass in the Model Context Protocol (CVE-2025-59536), and API key exfiltration before trust confirmation (CVE-2026-21852), potentially exposing broader AI-driven workflows.

Anthropic’s API Workspaces feature lets multiple API keys share access to cloud-stored project files. Since files belong to the entire workspace and not just one API key, stealing a single key could let attackers access, change, or delete shared data, upload harmful content, and create unexpected charges. This behavior puts the whole team at risk, not just one developer.

The flaws highlight a new AI supply chain threat: repository configuration files now act as execution logic, so simply opening an untrusted project can trigger abuse. Anthropic addressed the issues by tightening trust prompts, blocking external tool execution, and restricting API calls until user approval.

“AI-powered coding tools are rapidly becoming part of enterprise development workflows. Their productivity benefits are significant, but so is the need to reassess traditional security assumptions.

Configuration files are no longer passive settings. They can influence execution, networking, and permissions.” concludes the report. “As AI integration deepens, security controls must evolve to match the new trust boundaries.”

There is a certain poetic justice in a cybersecurity-related story that has emerged from Moscow this week: A man has been accused of trying to extort money... from a notorious Russian ransomware gang.

Conti, one of the world's most infamous cybercriminal operations, was allegedly the victim of an attempted scam by someone pretending to be an officer of Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB).

According to a report by Russian news outlet RBC, a Moscow resident named Ruslan Satuchin allegedly contacted a member of the Conti cybercriminal group in September 2022, and claimed to have influence over law enforcement's investigation into the gang.

Satuchin is alleged to have made a simple offer to Conti: pay up, or face criminal consequences. The irony that a ransomware group with a history of extorting money from hacked organisations was itself being extorted is surely not lost on anybody.

Satuchin has denied any wrongdoing, and he is reportedly being held in pre-trial detention in Moscow after police argued successfully that he should remain in custody to avoid the possibility of witness intimidation.

If convicted, Satuchin faces up to ten years in prison and a fine of up to one million rubles (approximately US $13,000)

At its peak, Conti was a professional cybercriminal enterprise, earning eye-watering amounts of money by blackmailing organisations including governments, businesses, and hospitals worldwide.

The Irish Health Service Executive alone estimated recovery costs from a Conti attack in 2021 at over US $600 million after it was hit in 2021.

The inner workings of the Conti group were revealed in 2022 when a pro-Ukraine researcher published tens of thousands of the gang's leaked chat logs, source code, and infrastructure documents. That data reinforced long-standing suspicions that the Conti group deliberately avoided Russian targets, and aligned itself with the interests of the Kremlin.

Which makes the idea of someone impersonating an FSB officer to shake them down all the more remarkable. You'd need extraordinary nerve — or extraordinary naivety — to try blackmailing a criminal organisation that many believed enjoyed protection from the Russian state.

After the leak, Conti largely collapsed - although individuals associated with the wider network are thought to have moved to other ransomware operations including Royal, Black Basta, and Akira.

In 2023, sanctions brought by the United States and UK formally named key members linked to Conti.

Conti's victims paid a heavy price for the gang's activities. It is, at least, mildly satisfying to learn that even ransomware gangs occasionally find themselves on the receiving end of someone else's scheme.

When the mysterious operator of an internet archiving-service decided to silence a curious Finnish blogger, they didn’t just send a stroppy email – they allegedly weaponised their own CAPTCHA page to launch a DDoS attack, threatened to invent an entirely new genre of AI porn, and tampered with parts of their own archive to smear the blogger’s name.

In this episode, we unravel how a website designed to preserve history may have trashed its own credibility – and how Wikipedia responded when trust went out the window.

Plus a ransomware gang shoots itself in the foot with a classic case of buffoonery, accidentally corrupting the very keys victims would need to decrypt their data. When even the criminals can’t unlock your files, what happens next?

All this, a surprisingly zen Pick of the Week, and a gloriously splenetic rant against web forms, on episode 456 of the award-winning “Smashing Security” podcast, with cybersecurity veteran Graham Cluley and special guest Paul Ducklin.

Finding Signal in the Noise: Lessons Learned Running a Honeypot with AI Assistance [Guest Diary]

[This is a Guest Diary by Austin Bodolay, an ISC intern as part of the SANS.edu BACS program]

Over the past several months, I have gained practical insight into the challenges of deploying and operating a honeypot, even within a relatively simple environment. This work highlighted how varying hardware, software, and network design—can significantly alter outcomes. Through this process, I observed both the value and the limitations of log collection. Comprehensive telemetry proved essential for understanding activity targeting the honeypot, yet it also became clear that improperly scoped or poorly interpreted logs can produce misleading conclusions. Prior to this research, I had almost no interaction with AI tools and struggled to identify practical ways to integrate them into my work. Throughout this experience, however, AI proved most valuable not as an automated solution, but as a collaborative aid—providing quick syntax on the CLI, offering alternative perspectives, and helping maintain analytical focus.

The DShield honeypot is a sensor that pretends to be a vulnerable system exposed to the internet. It collects information from scans and attacks that are often automated, providing insight to analyst what threat actors are targeting and how. The honeypot generates a large amount of data, much of it low-value.  Deciding what is meaningful, what separate events are related, and what (if any) actions should be taken. Being able to accurately assess the data requires the right information. And in the event a true incident does occur, being able to piece together the breadcrumbs requires the data is actually there. Piecing it all together requires the right methodology. Using an AI, like ChatGPT, is extremely helpful in tying these concepts together.

The Data: What Was Collected and Why

In the few months my SIEM has collected 8 million logs from 14,000 unique IP addresses. There is a lot of noise on the internet from automated scanners and toolkits that frequently repeat the same actions to every device willing to listen. This constant "background noise" on the internet are systems constantly scanning for what is available, what is potentially vulnerable, and what is low hanging fruit that can provide a foothold for something more. Is there an exposed administrative panel? Do these default credentials work anywhere? And if so, what does information does this hold or what does it have access to? Is this a developer? Does the system have private information worth value? The honeypot sensor provides a way to analyze this traffic to better understand what threat actors are after and how they are going after it.

The basic information that is collected on the honeypot includes source IP addresses, port, protocol, URL, and a few other metrics. The logs primarily record the traffic that was sent to the honeypot. If your router dropped the packets or failed to send them to the honeypot, the logs will not be generated to be sent to the SIEM. The NetFlow logs add a little extra information, like the direction of the packets, the byte count, and packets that were dropped before reaching the honeypot. What my current system does not show is the actual payloads in the traffic, the headers of packets, or the exploit details. ChatGPT helped identify what type of data I actually have, what types of conclusions can be drawn from this data, and methods to validate these conclusions. ChatGPT also identified dead ends early on, saving me time from going down rabbit holes by pointing out the current data will never be able to positively affirm any conclusion.

I came across a log that raised some concerns. After providing simple details of the devices involved, the type of log generated, clarifying the log is on the gateway and not the SIEM, and the values recorded in the data, ChatGPT provided insights as to what likely generated this traffic and why it likely isn't an alternative event. I performed additional research to confirm this information is true.

Interaction with ChatGPT

Researching a unique User-Agent "libredtail-http", I began checking a high level how frequently this shows up. I noticed that in several months of logs, this User-Agent appeared for the first time on my sensor in December of 2025. There are 34 unique IP addresses that have used it, most of which have less than 100 events. Interestingly, all events occur on the same days, with up to 2 weeks of silence between the next set of events. Additionally, the URL request and payload sizes were identical among all events, regardless of the source IP address. When researching the User-Agent string "libredtail-http", I came across many articles about malware. Sharing some of the information found with ChatGPT, it quickly identified what I was likely seeing, who it is targeting, what makes an event vulnerable to the attacks, and how to protect from them. More likely than malware, what I was seeing is an automated multi-staged toolkit that is scanning the internet for vulnerable Apache servers, Linux web interfaces, and IoT devices. The source of scans is using low-cost methods to rotate through IP addresses, combined with intermittent campaign timing (burst -> idle -> burst) to reduce detection and attribution. This is likely a botnet and the goal is to enroll new systems into the botnet for additional scanners, proxies, and DDoS nodes. I then began researching this information, such as the CVE mentioned by ChatGPT, indicators of compromise (IOCs), and comparing various sources to what I have in my logs to validate the accuracy of the statements. The responses were very accurate. Had I not used ChatGPT, I would have started searching for IOCs in my logs for signs of malware mentioned in the articles and possibly wasted several hours. I likely would have come to a similar conclusion, but I admit it would have used a lot of my time.

Interaction with ChatGPT based on findings above.

I have found the most value comes by clearly stating what your objective is. The more details provided early on reduce vague answers.

Conclusion and Lessons Learned

Having more logs doesn't equal more answers. If a system is comprised and reaches out to a malicious server, having logs of only incoming traffic won't ever catch this malicious activity. And if you have logs showing a connection with a large volume of data outgoing, but the logs don't include the actual content in the packets, it's nearly impossible to know what was actually inside those packets. And if you are tasked with reviewing tens of thousands or millions of logs, it’s nice to have some help. Consider the use of central logging, something like a SIEM, combined with reaching out to a team member for some help if you are part of a team.

The CLAIR Model: A Synthesized Conceptual Framework for Mapping Critical Infrastructure Interdependencies [Guest Diary]

[This is a guest diary contributed by Claire Perry (LinkedIn)]

The structural integrity of modern society is predicated upon a dense and often opaque network of interconnected systems. For decades, the modeling of these systems remained siloed within specific domains: industrial processes were governed by the hierarchical constraints of the Purdue Model, while corporate and data-centric ecosystems were organized using various Enterprise Architecture (EA) frameworks (Fortinet, n.d.; The Open Group, n.d.). However, the accelerating convergence of Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT) has exposed a critical analytical gap. Disruptions in the external utility grid, once considered an unlikely factor, now propagate through the physical and logical layers of the enterprise with devastating speed, as evidenced by recent power-related disconnections of large-scale data center operations (Mural et al., 2026; Islam et al., 2023).

To bridge this gap, this report introduces the Comprehensive Linkage and Architectural Infrastructure Resiliency (CLAIR) Model. The CLAIR Model is a new conceptual framework that synthesizes the vertical depth of the Purdue Enterprise Reference Architecture (PERA) with the multi-dimensional, interrogative breadth of the Zachman Framework for Enterprise Architecture (Fortinet, n.d.; The Open Group, n.d.). By establishing a unified taxonomy that accounts for everything from the sub-physical utility grid to the hyper-distributed cloud, the CLAIR Model provides a structured scope for identifying and visualizing critical infrastructure interdependencies. This framework prioritizes the identification of these linkages over specific mitigations, offering a diagnostic tool for understanding how failures in one sector, such as the power grid, generate cascading effects across the data center and manufacturing landscapes (Fortinet, n.d.; Islam et al., 2023; Virginia Department of Emergency Management, n.d.).

Historical Context and the Necessity of Synthesis

The conceptual origin of industrial modeling lies in the 1990s at Purdue University, where researchers developed the Purdue Enterprise Reference Architecture (PERA) to standardize computer-integrated manufacturing (Fortinet, n.d.). The Purdue Model established a functional hierarchy ranging from Level 0 (physical processes) to Level 4 (business logistics), effectively creating an "automation pyramid." Isolation of sensitive controllers from internet-facing business networks is typically achieved via a "demilitarized zone" (DMZ) at Level 3.5 (Fortinet, n.d.).

While the Purdue Model excels at describing the internal dependencies of a single plant, it is inherently insular. It treats the external world as a series of inputs (Level 0) or external services (Level 5) without mapping the complex, bidirectional relationships between the plant and the broader infrastructure (Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, 2025a; Williams, 1994). In parallel, Enterprise Architecture (EA) frameworks like Zachman were developed to organize the design artifacts of complex organizations from multiple stakeholder perspectives (The Open Group, n.d.). The CLAIR Model recognizes that neither framework, in isolation, can characterize the risks of a "system-of-systems" environment (Department of Defense, 2008). In modern critical infrastructure, a data center is not merely a facility at Level 4 of the Purdue Model; it is a massive electric load at the intersection of global telecommunications, regional power grids, and local water supply systems (UK Parliament, 2025; Chen et al., 2025). Failure to understand these dynamics results in ineffective response and poor coordination between decision-makers (Dudenhoeffer et al., 2006).

The CLAIR Model: Structural Hierarchy and Extended Levels

The CLAIR Model expands the traditional five-level Purdue hierarchy into a ten-level architectural stack. This expansion is designed to capture the "Level -1" dependencies on primary utility infrastructure and the "Level 6" and "Level 7" dependencies on cloud and safety systems (CISA, 2025a; Russo, 2022).

Level -1: The Primary Infrastructure Foundation

The inclusion of Level -1 acknowledges that the "physics" of Level 0 is entirely dependent on a primary technology layer that exists outside the control of the plant operator (Islam et al., 2023). In the CLAIR Model, Level -1 encompasses the electricity generation and transmission systems, which exhibit complex dynamic behaviors such as low inertia and harmonic distortion when interfacing with data center power electronics (Chen et al., 2025). This layer is the source of cascading failure triggers, where a line fault in the high-voltage grid necessitates immediate load redistribution, often leading to voltage fluctuations that destabilize Level 0 sensors and Level 1 controllers (Islam et al., 2023).

Levels 0-5: What Can Be Controlled

Levels 0–5 are generally within the organization’s direct control because the systems, assets, and processes at these layers are typically owned and/or administered by the business, company, or government entity. However, even within this “control zone,” organizations still inherit external dependencies, especially for software, firmware, and operating systems that rely on vendor-provided patches and updates. If an update is delayed, unavailable, or operationally difficult to deploy, the organization may remain exposed to known vulnerabilities or be forced to rely on temporary mitigations until a corrective patch can be implemented (Souppaya & Scarfone, 2022). As a result, these layers may appear internally controlled while quietly depending on upstream providers and external services that introduce risk across otherwise well-managed environments.

Level 6 and 7: The Distributed Sovereignty

As organizations move toward "Smart Factories" and "Hyperscale Data Centers," the reliance on Level 6 (The Connected World) becomes absolute (CISA, 2025a). This level includes the Cloud-Fog-Edge computing model, where instant processing occurs at the edge but long-term analytics and orchestration reside in the cloud (CISA, 2025a). Level 7 represents the "Safety and High-Trust" layer, which is isolated even from the corporate enterprise to ensure that catastrophic failures at lower levels do not prevent a safe system shutdown (Russo, 2022). Level 7 are systems or items that are critical to restoration of levels 0-6 within the organization. The loss of level 7 is a catastrophic issue.

Integrating Enterprise Architecture: The CLAIR MatrixLinkeIn)

The CLAIR Model maps its ten levels against the six interrogatives of the Zachman Framework to identify dependencies across different dimensions of the infrastructure (The Open Group, n.d.).

The What (Data and Resource Flow): At the lower levels (-1 to 1), "data" is often a physical resource flow, such as electrons or water pressure (VA DEM, n.d.). At the higher levels (4 to 6), it transitions into digital information payloads (Macaulay, 2025)

The How (Operational Function): This dimension describes the transformation processes, from ladder logic at Level 1 to machine learning algorithms at Level 6 (CISA, 2025a; Australian Signals Directorate, 2024).

The Where (Network and Spatial Distribution): This captures geographic interdependencies (Dudenhoeffer et al., 2006). A physical collapse of a pylon destroys both the power source (Level -1) and the communication path (Level 3) sharing that pylon (Islam et al., 2023; VA DEM, n.d.).

The Who (Stakeholder and Actor Matrix): Maps "managerial independencies" where a Distribution System Operator (DSO) at Level -1 must coordinate with a corporate CIO at Level 5 and a third-party cloud provider at Level 6 (DoD, 2008; Islam et al., 2023).

The When (Temporal Dynamics): Visualizes the "transient response" during a failure, showing how a grid frequency deviation at Level -1 propagates through the stack faster than a Level 2 supervisory system can respond (Islam et al., 2023; Shuvro et al., 2023).

The Why (Motivation and Strategy): Identifies where business goals conflict, such as a utility shedding load to save the grid versus a data center's 99.999% availability goal (Mural et al., 2026; The Open Group, n.d.).

Case Study: Power Grid Failures and Data Center Operations

The CLAIR Model demonstrates that power grid failures are not merely physical events; they are systemic crises. Data centers are emerging as prominent large electric loads with demand patterns characterized by high power density (Mural et al., 2026; Chen et al., 2025).

The Mechanism of Cascading Failure

A cascading failure is a sequence where one component malfunction triggers successive failures in a "domino mechanism" (Islam et al., 2023). Within the CLAIR framework:

The Trigger (Level -1): A disturbance, such as a transmission line failure, occurs in the utility grid (Shuvro et al., 2023).

Load Redistribution: The grid redistributes flow, but because data centers have massive, steady loads, this can push remaining infrastructure beyond capacity (Mural et al., 2026; Islam et al., 2023).

Voltage Fluctuations: A sudden fluctuation in Northern Virginia recently triggered the simultaneous disconnection of 60 data centers, creating a 1,500-megawatt (MW) power surplus almost instantly (Mural et al., 2026).

Information Blindness: As power fails, the cyber network monitoring the grid may also fail. If cloud-based analytics (Level 6) lose connectivity, operators lose visibility, leading to erroneous adjustments and a total blackout (Islam et al., 2023; CISA, 2025a).

Identifying Dependencies: A Typological Deep-Dive

The CLAIR Model categorizes every identified link into a matrix of dependency types. This taxonomy is essential for understanding the nature of the vulnerability.

Sankey Flow Maps for Dependency Visualization

To visualize inbound and outbound data dependencies, organizations can use Sankey Flow Maps; flow diagrams that represent transfers or reliance relationships using variable-width links, where wider flows indicate greater magnitude or criticality (Schmidt, 2008). Rather than ranking sensitivities as standalone bars, this method makes dependency direction and coupling immediately visible by placing the system-of-interest at the center and showing weighted flows entering and exiting it.

Inbound dependencies (inputs to the system): The external data, services, or control-plane functions that the system relies on to operate (e.g., identity assertions, routing/DNS, upstream connectivity, threat intelligence feeds).

Outbound dependencies (outputs from the system): The downstream systems, users, or business processes that rely on the system’s outputs (e.g., hosted applications/APIs, telemetry to security monitoring, billing/FinOps data).

In practice, each flow can be assigned a dependency “weight” (e.g., criticality, volume, recovery difficulty, or a composite score), enabling teams to quickly identify high-consequence dependencies and prioritize resilience, monitoring, redundancy, and governance controls.

AI as an Interdependency Vector in the CLAIR Model

The integration of AI across levels creates new interdependencies. AI models at the operational layers (0-3) introduce risks such as data quality dependency, model drift, and an explainability gap (ASD, 2024). To maintain resilience, the CLAIR Model incorporates operational constraints like the "80% bandwidth rule," ensuring that data aggregation for AI training does not exceed network capacity to protect critical control signals at Level 1 (ASD, 2024).

AI-OT Convergence Risks

When AI models are deployed at the operational layers (0-3), they introduce failure mechanisms not present in traditional deterministic system:

Data Quality Dependency: AI models at Level 1 depend on the normalization and quality of sensor data from Level 0. If the sensors are compromised (even at the physics level), the AI will make decisions based on untrusted data.

Model Drift Dependency: Over time, alterations to production processes can cause an AI model to drift from its initial training. This creates a temporal dependency where the model must be periodically updated from Level 6, creating a cyber-linkage that bypasses the DMZ.

Explainability Gap: In a crisis, if an AI-driven controller at Level 1 fails or takes an unexpected action, the "Lack of Explainability" increases the operator's recovery time, potentially allowing a local failure to cascade into a regional one.

National Security and Policy Frameworks: The Institutional Why

The "Why" of the CLAIR Model is increasingly driven by policy, such as the National Security Memorandum on Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience (NSM-22) (Congressional Research Service, 2024). This framework groups infrastructure functions into four areas: connect, distribute, manage, and supply, which the CLAIR Model maps to specific assets and their dependencies across the stack (CRS, 2024; CISA, 2025b).Maturity and Assessment in the CLAIR Framework

To evaluate the strength of identified dependencies, the CLAIR Model adopts maturity indicator levels (International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], 2021).

Impact on Dependency Risk Real-time visualization across the entire stack

A key insight is that resilience is only as strong as its weakest link. If a data center has MIL 3 resilience at Level 5 but relies on a Level -1 power source with MIL 0 monitoring, the overall system resilience is effectively MIL 0 (IAEA, 2021).

Conclusion: Visualizing the Interconnected World

The CLAIR Model synthesis of the Purdue Model and Enterprise Architecture moves beyond a narrow view of internal security toward a holistic understanding of infrastructure interdependencies (CISA, 2025a). It demonstrates that the impact of a power grid failure on data centers is multi-dimensional, involving transients at Level -1, sensor failure at Level 0, and business discontinuity at Level 4 (Mural et al., 2026; Islam et al., 2023). By focusing on these linkages, from the physics of the grid to the logic of the cloud, architects can finally visualize the "walking failures" that define our interconnected world (Islam et al., 2023; CISA, 2025b).

[36] Recorded Future - Recorded Future Expands Coverage of Scams and Financial Fraud with Money Mule Intelligence from CYBERA

Recorded Future Expands Coverage of Scams and Financial Fraud with Money Mule Intelligence from CYBERA

Recorded Future is expanding its payment fraud prevention capabilities through a partnership with CYBERA, the industry leader in detecting and verifying data on scam-linked bank accounts.

Available for purchase now via the Recorded Future Platform, Money Mule Intelligence helps fraud teams identify the accounts criminals use to extract and move stolen funds—addressing a critical gap as scams increasingly become banks' most pressing fraud challenge.

The Growing Threat of Authorized Push Payment Fraud

Authorized Push Payment (APP) fraud is accelerating. In the U.S., APP fraud losses are projected to reach nearly $15B by 2028, up from $8.3B in 2024, according to Deloitte. While traditional card fraud continues to decline, APP fraud is climbing, fueled by AI-generated deepfakes, personalized scam scripts, and instant payment systems like FedNow and Zelle that move money faster than conventional fraud controls can intercept it.

Mule accounts, or money mules, are part of the critical infrastructure that makes these scams possible. They provide the bridge that converts stolen payments into untraceable cash or cryptocurrency. Without them, most APP fraud would collapse because criminals cannot risk receiving funds directly into their own accounts. By the time victims realize they've been scammed, mule accounts have already moved the money through multiple layers, typically ending in cash withdrawals or crypto conversions.

Additionally, the sophistication of mule operations is increasing. Criminal organizations now employ "mule herders" who manage hundreds of accounts at once, using AI to simulate normal transaction behavior (grocery purchases, streaming subscriptions, etc.) so accounts don't appear dormant or suspicious. This makes detection through traditional pattern analysis increasingly difficult.

Regulators are responding by shifting liability to banks, often viewing those allowing mule accounts to operate as part of the criminal infrastructure itself. For example, the UK now requires banks to reimburse scam victims and allows them to delay suspicious payments for investigation, while U.S. regulators are signaling that banks may be held liable for failing to detect mule accounts.

Detecting mule accounts is fundamentally difficult. They’re designed to blend in with legitimate activity, and traditional fraud controls can struggle to distinguish between a genuine customer payment and a scam transfer until it's too late.

CYBERA's Approach to Mule Intelligence

The challenge of detecting and disrupting mule account networks is what led CYBERA's founders to build their solution. Coming from legal practice and law enforcement, CYBERA's leadership team worked scam cases where they witnessed how recovery becomes impossible once funds move through the financial system. They realized that money mule networks represent a central vulnerability in the scam economy, one that banks had limited visibility into.

Today, CYBERA helps banks and payment networks disrupt scams at the point where funds are extracted. CYBERA's AI-powered Scam Engagement System generates intelligence on bank accounts and payment endpoints actively used by scam networks.

Unlike probabilistic risk scoring, CYBERA verifies each account, providing evidence and contextual metadata to enable proactive prevention across both internal accounts and outbound payments while minimizing false positives.

CYBERA supports two core use cases:

On-Us Mule Detection, which helps identify mule accounts held at your institution that are already linked to confirmed scam activity. This enables early detection and disruption of high-risk accounts, reducing downstream fraud, repeat victimization, and regulatory exposure within a bank’s accountholders.

Off-Us Screening, which screens outbound payments to external beneficiary accounts before execution, helping to prevent customers from sending funds to scammer-controlled accounts. This is particularly valuable for high-value transfers, social engineering attacks, and customer-initiated payments where traditional controls are limited.

Large financial institutions have already prevented multiple six-figure losses by embedding CYBERA’s intelligence into their transaction monitoring workflows. CYBERA has also been accepted as a member of the Mastercard Start Path program, making it the first Recorded Future partner to achieve this distinction and further validating its role in the payments ecosystem.

How Money Mule Intelligence Expands Payment Fraud Intelligence

Payment Fraud Intelligence (PFI) correlates the widest set of disparate, pre-monetization indicators of fraud to help teams act before their customers are impacted. Money Mule Intelligence extends that capability, giving fraud teams the verified intelligence needed to make high-confidence decisions that disrupt scams by flagging accounts that have been confirmed as mule infrastructure through direct investigation. Together, they provide coverage from initial compromise through attempted cash-out, helping fraud teams prevent losses at multiple intervention points.

Chief Product Officer at Recorded Future

As regulators increasingly expect banks to prevent scam-enabled transfers, Money Mule Intelligence provides the verified data needed to comply with emerging reimbursement requirements while reducing the operational burden of post-incident investigation and remediation.

PFI users that purchase this capability, can now act on both sides of the transaction—compromised payment instruments and scam-linked receiving accounts—with evidence-backed intelligence that minimizes false positives and aligns with the industry's shift toward proactive fraud prevention.

Gottumukkala out, Andersen in as acting CISA director

Madhu Gottumukkala is out as acting director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, with current agency executive director for cybersecurity Nick Andersen replacing him as the interim leader.

News of Gottumukkala’s departure breaks one day after CyberScoop reported on widespread dismay with the agency’s performance during the first year of the Trump administration, with significant criticism aimed at Gottumukkala’s leadership on both sides of the aisle after a number of unflattering stories about his stewardship.

“Madhu Gottumukkala has done a remarkable job in a thankless task of helping reform CISA back to its core statutory mission,” a Department of Homeland Security official told CyberScoop Thursday. “He tackled the woke, weaponized, and bloated bureaucracy that existed at CISA, wrangling contracts to save American taxpayer dollars.”

Gottumukkala, served as chief information officer under then-South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, now secretary of DHS, before he was picked as deputy director of the agency. Sean Plankey’s nomination to serve as full-time director of CISA has stalled, leaving Gottumukkala as the acting director in his place.

Gottumukkala will take on a new role at DHS, as director of strategic implementation. Andersen has won more favorable reviews from industry and cyber professionals during his tenure at CISA than did Gottumukkala, whom some still praised for his technical acumen.

ABC News first reported the news on the Gottumukkala and Andersen moves. The news comes the same day as reports about another leadership change at the agency, with Cybersecurity Dive first reporting on the exit of Robert Costello as CISA CIO.

While some officials CyberScoop spoke to for its story about CISA this week believed the agency had some duplication, most thought the Trump administration had cut far deeper than needed, damaging the agency.

Andersen has held several IT and cybersecurity roles in the public sector over the past two decades, including positions at the Coast Guard, Navy and Department of Energy.

Project Compass is Europol’s new playbook for taking on The Com

A global law enforcement effort has taken root to combat The Com, a sprawling nihilistic network of thousands of minors and young adults engaged in various forms of cybercrime, including physical violence and extortion.

Project Compass, an operation coordinated by Europol with support from 28 countries, including all members of the Five Eyes, has resulted in the arrest of 30 perpetrators since the initiative got underway in January 2025, authorities said in a news release Thursday.

Officials said sustained countermeasures have contributed to the full and partial identification of 179 perpetrators, while the operation has also safeguarded four victims and identified up to 62 victims.

The Com is splintered into three primary subsets with different objectives the FBI describes as Hacker Com, In Real Life Com and Extortion Com. Crimes attributed to group members have grown increasingly complex, with perpetrators going to great lengths to mask identities, hide financial transactions and launder money.

“These networks deliberately target children in the digital spaces where they feel most at ease,” Anna Sjöberg, head of Europol’s European Counter Terrorism Centre, said in a statement.

Various branches of The Com have been linked to high-profile crimes over the past few years, and law enforcement has responded with heightened activity and interest in the group’s activities.

The Com is vast — many perpetrators remain at large and even more victims are still suffering and awaiting aid.

This growing global effort to thwart shifting crime trends with appropriate resources has built a foundation that will foster results beyond those achieved to date, said Allison Nixon, chief research officer at Unit 221B.

“How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time,” she told CyberScoop. “The Com represents a major social problem impacting youth, and peoples’ expectations need to be realistic. These early numbers and ramping up effort over time is what success looks like and we need to encourage that.”

An effective police response to The Com requires a different way of thinking and retooling, “but it is more solvable than crime originating from hostile nations,” Nixon said.

Project Compass is built around an information-sharing network, which enables each of the partner nations to assist with investigations across various specialized units. Countries are also sharing advice for preventative measures and mobilizing data sprints to bring intelligence together for ongoing cases.

“Project Compass allows us to intervene earlier, safeguard victims and disrupt those who exploit vulnerability for extremist purposes,” Sjöberg said. “No country can address this threat alone — and through this cooperation, we are closing the gaps they try to hide in.”

Europol did not identify the 30 people arrested under Project Compass thus far. Yet, at least some of those cases are public.

Authorities during the past year have arrested multiple members of a Com offshoot known as 764, which is a growing online threat to coerce vulnerable children to produce child sexual abuse material of themselves, gor material, self mutilation, sibling abuse, animal abuses and other acts of violence.

Two alleged leaders of 764, Leonidas Varagiannis and Prasan Nepal, were arrested and charged for directing and distributing CSAM in April.

Tony Christoper Long and Alexis Aldair Chavez both pleaded guilty late last year to multiple crimes linked to their involvement with the extremist group. Other alleged 764 members have been arrested in the United States more recently, including Erik Lee Madison and Aaron Corey.

Senate moves one step closer to passing health care cyber reforms

A key Senate Committee moved to advance legislation that would overhaul cybersecurity practices at the Department of Health and Human Services.

The bipartisan Health Care Cybersecurity and Resiliency Act sailed through the Senate Health, Education and Labor Committee Thursday on a 22-1 vote, with only Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., opposing it.

The legislation, sponsored by committee chair Bill Cassidy, R-La., and Sens. Mark Warner, D-Va., John Cornyn, R-Texas and Maggie Hassan, D-NH, would require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to develop a cybersecurity incident response plan for the department and provide it to Congress for review.

It would direct the department to partner with the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency on oversight of cybersecurity in the health care and public health sectors, create specific cybersecurity guidance for rural healthcare providers and develop a plan to boost cybersecurity literacy within the healthcare workforce.

Cassidy and other members cited the 2024 Change Healthcare attack as a major driver for the legislation, arguing the incident was emblematic of a sector that is under constant siege from cybercriminals, ransomware actors and nation-states.

“Last year there were more than 730 cyber breaches affecting over 270 million Americans [connected to] Change Healthcare, exposing 190 million people’s data and delaying access to care.”  Cassidy said at the opening of the hearing.

Another provision would designate the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response at HHS as the Sector Risk Management Agency for the Healthcare and Public Health sectors.

Earlier this month, an HHS official from that office speaking at CyberTalks, presented by CyberScoop, said the Change Healthcare attack took many private and public sector defenders by surprise, underscoring how the compromise of a little-known third-party service provider concentrated within a single sector can still take down wide swaths of industry.

“It wasn’t a hospital, it was a company most people have never heard of and had major impacts on our sector and threatened the liquidity of our entire health care system,” said Charlee Hess, director of the healthcare and public health sector cybersecurity at the Administration for Strategy Preparedness and Response division. “We recovered from that, but we realized there are third-party risks lurking in our health care system, and we don’t even know they’re there. Where are those entities or systems that will have an outsized impact on our sector?”

The bill would update one of the sector’s main data protection laws, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, to ensure regulated entities use modern cybersecurity practices. It would also establish a new federal grant program to help hospitals, cancer centers, rural health clinics, the Indian Health Service, academic health centers and partnering nonprofit organizations adopt cybersecurity best practices

“Cyberattacks in the health care sector can have a wide range of devastating consequences, from exposing private medical information to disrupting care in ERs – and it can be particularly difficult for medical providers in rural communities with fewer resources to prevent and respond to these attacks,” Hassan said in a statement.

Governments issue warning over Cisco zero-day attacks dating back to 2023

Attackers have been exploiting a pair of zero-day vulnerabilities in Cisco’s network edge software for at least three years, and the global campaign is ongoing, authorities said across a series of warnings released Wednesday.

The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency issued an emergency directive about the global attacks and issued joint guidance with the Five Eyes to help defenders respond and hunt for evidence of compromise.

This marks the second series of multiple actively exploited zero-day vulnerabilities in Cisco edge technology since last spring. Both campaigns resulted in CISA emergency directives months after the attacks were first detected, and both attack sprees were underway for at least a year before they were identified.

Authorities refrained from attributing the attacks to any nation state or threat group. Cisco Talos researchers assigned the exploits and post-compromise activity to UAT-8616, which they only described as a “highly sophisticated threat actor.”

The activity cluster’s “attempted exploitation indicates a continuing trend of the targeting of network edge devices by cyber threat actors to establish persistent footholds into high-value organizations including critical infrastructure sectors,” Cisco Talos said in a threat advisory.

Malicious activity linked to this campaign is far reaching and attackers have exploited vulnerabilities in targeted systems to access and potentially compromise federal networks, Nick Andersen, CISA’s executive assistant director for cybersecurity, said during a media briefing Wednesday.

Andersen declined to say when CISA was first aware of this activity and did not provide details about potential victims, adding that officials are working through the beginning stages of mitigation.

In the jointly issued threat hunt guide, the Five Eyes said all members were aware that the most recent zero-day — CVE-2026-20127 — was identified and confirmed actively exploited in late 2025. Officials and Cisco did not explain why it took at least two months to disclose and patch the vulnerability, and share emergency mitigation guidance.

Attackers are gaining full control of a system in a chain by exploiting CVE-2026-20127 to bypass authentication, then downgrading software to a version vulnerable to CVE-2022-20775 to escalate privileges, said Douglas McKee, director of vulnerability intelligence at Rapid7.

“That second step allows them to move from administrative control to root on the underlying operating system. That downgrade step shows deliberate knowledge of product versioning and patch history,” he told CyberScoop. “This is not opportunistic scanning. This is structured tradecraft.”

CISA added CVE-2022-20775 and CVE-2026-20127 to its known exploited vulnerabilities catalog Wednesday.

The three-year gap between known initial attacks and detected exploitation of the zero-days showcases the attackers’ surgical use of vulnerabilities and the highly targeted nature of their campaign, said Ben Harris, founder and CEO of watchTowr.

The timeline and known attack path also indicates operational discipline that allowed attackers to maintain long-term access in critical network infrastructure without triggering alarms, McKee said. Those activities align “more closely with state-sponsored espionage tradecraft than financially motivated crime,” he added.

CISA’s emergency directive requires federal agencies to take inventory of all vulnerable Cisco SD-WAN systems, collect logs from those systems, apply Cisco’s security updates, hunt for evidence of compromise and follow Cisco’s guidance by Friday.

The latest campaign targeting Cisco network edge technology shares many similarities with another string of attacks officials and Cisco warned about in September. Those attacks, which involved at least two actively exploited zero-days, were underway for at least a year before they were first discovered in May.

Cisco did not answer questions about any potential connections between the campaigns. The vendor and officials have also thus far avoided sharing any details about what occurred behind the scenes during these sustained attacks.

A spokesperson for Cisco urged customers to upgrade software and follow guidance from its advisory.

Unfortunately, it’s too late for some Cisco SD-WAN customers to patch, Harris said. “Cisco’s advice to fully rebuild and look for prior signs of intrusion should be taken seriously.”

Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters auditioning female voices to sharpen social engineering

Telegram posts promise up to $1,000 per call as gang refines IT helpdesk ruse

Prolific cybercrime crew Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters (SLSH) is reportedly recruiting women in the hope of improving its social engineering success.

According to Telegram channel posts made on February 22, gathered by Dataminr, the group behind last year's Salesloft Drift attacks promised payments between $500-$1,000 per call, depending on "success and hit rate."

Interested applicants are invited to apply by sending a message to the group's "Support" account. They will be asked a series of questions before being accepted, the group said, and those who pass the test will be given a script to work from.

SLSH is known for effective social engineering. Experts who have listened in on calls carried out by Scattered Spider, one of the groups that form the cybercrime triad, previously confirmed that its tactics are sophisticated and highly effective.

The Telegram ads suggest that SLSH is looking for people to socially engineer IT helpdesk staff. This aligns with the group's typical MO of deceiving IT helpdesks into handing over credentials that attackers can use to gain access to an organization's network.

"This recruitment drive represents a calculated evolution in SLH's tactics," said Jeanette Miller-Osborn, field cyber intelligence officer at Dataminr.

Ransomware attacks kept climbing in 2025 as gangs refused to stay dead

"By specifically seeking female voices, the group likely aims to bypass the 'traditional' profiles of attackers that IT helpdesk staff may be trained to identify, thereby increasing the effectiveness of their impersonation efforts."

Miller-Osborn recommends that organizations make their helpdesks aware of these shifting tactics and ensure identities are thoroughly verified, either through video calls or secondary internal verification.

SLSH's recruitment drive is the latest in what appears to be a trend of crowdsourcing efforts.

Back in October, and again via Telegram, the group said it would pay anyone $10 in Bitcoin to "endlessly harass" executives at organizations it was trying to extort.

"You have permission to endlessly harass these executives till they comply with us," its message stated. "When we tell you stop emailing a company or number of executives emails, you are to stop emailing them. This will be centralized and well operated."

When The Register asked SLSH about how many people had taken up its offer after the first few days, it claimed it had "practically paid out over $1,000 at this point," though these claims cannot be independently verified. ®

[TAM METİN - 633 kelime]
Cisco says hackers have been exploiting a bug in one of its popular networking products used by large enterprises for at least three years, prompting the U.S. government and its allies to urge organizations to take action.

The bug, which has a maximum-rated vulnerability severity score of 10.0, allows hackers to remotely break into networks running its Catalyst SD-WAN products, which allow large companies and government agencies with multiple offices to connect their private networks over long distances.

By exploiting this bug over the internet, hackers can gain the highest level of permissions to these devices and maintain persistent hidden access inside a victim’s network, allowing them to spy or steal data over a long period of time.

Cisco said after discovering the bug, its researchers traced evidence of exploitation as far back as 2023. Some of the affected organizations are said to be critical infrastructure. The company did not provide specifics, but “critical infrastructure” can refer to everything from power grids and water supply to the transportation sector.

Several governments, including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States, warned in an alert that threat actors are targeting organizations “globally.”

U.S. cybersecurity agency CISA ordered all civilian federal agencies to patch their systems by end-of-day Friday, citing an imminent threat and unacceptable risk to the federal government. The federal cybersecurity agency, which is currently running at reduced capacity due to a partial government shutdown, said it was aware of ongoing exploitation.

Neither Cisco nor the governments attributed the attacks to a specific threat group or nation state, if known, but tracked one cluster of activity as UAT-8616.

In December, Cisco warned of a similarly rated 10.0 vulnerability in the Async software that runs most of its products, which was being actively used to hack into its customer networks.

Spyware makers sentenced to prison in Greece for wiretapping politicians and journalists

A Greek court on Thursday sentenced the founder of Intellexa, a collective of spyware makers, to eight years in prison for illegal wiretapping and privacy violations, according to several reports.

Tal Dilian and three other Intellexa executives were tried for their role in a scandal dubbed “Greek Watergate,” which dates back to 2022. The Greek government was accused of wiretapping the phones of politicians, journalists, businesspeople, and military officials with spyware developed by Intellexa.

The other people sentenced today include Dilian’s business partner Sara Aleksandra Fayssal Hamou; his former deputy administrator and shareholder of Intellexa, Felix Bitzios; and Yiannis Lavranos, who owned a company linked to Intellexa.

Dilian did not respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment.

This is the first known time a spyware maker has been sentenced to jail following the misuse of their technology.

In 2024, the U.S. government sanctioned Intellexa and several of its linked companies, Dilian, and Hamou, for their role in developing its spyware, known as Predator, used in the targeting of Americans, including government officials and journalists.

The court ordered authorities to further investigate, and stayed the sentence pending appeal.

[44] CSO Online - Why application security must start at the load balancer
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Fri, 27 Feb 2026 11:00:00 +0000
Link: https://www.csoonline.com/article/4138000/why-application-security-must-start-at-the-load-balancer.html

[TAM METİN - 1269 kelime]
Most breaches don’t outsmart your stack; they walk through a permissive load balancer you tuned for speed instead of trust.

For a long time, I thought of the load balancer as a performance device. Its job was to distribute traffic, improve uptime, and make applications feel fast. Security was something that happened elsewhere, on firewalls, inside WAFs or deep in the application code.

That perspective changed early in my consulting career.

I worked with a customer who had invested heavily in security tools like firewalls, endpoint protection and a WAF buried deep in the stack. The technology was solid. The problem wasn’t the tools; it was the architecture. At the edge, the load balancer was treated purely as a performance device, tuned only for speed. Security policies such as strict TLS enforcement, request hygiene, and basic abuse controls were pushed to later phases.

The attacker didn’t break our tools. They simply walked through the open path our design had left behind. Nothing failed technically. The architecture failed.

Since then, every architecture I design starts with one principle: Application security begins at the traffic entry point. And in most modern environments, that entry point is the load balancer.

What I saw go wrong in real projects

I’ve worked with banks, healthcare systems, SaaS companies, and retailers. Different industries, same pattern:

Internet traffic hits the load balancer

The load balancer forwards traffic as fast as possible

Security happens later

The problem is simple. If the first system doesn’t enforce trust, everything behind it is already compromised by design.

Example 1: Financial services

The team invested heavily in downstream security tools. But the load balancer accepted weak TLS versions and ciphers because some legacy clients still needed it. Attackers forced connections down to older TLS versions, exploited weak cipher suites, and gained visibility into traffic that should never have been exposed.

Fix: Disable TLS 1.0 and 1.1, enforce strong cipher suites, implement HSTS and OCSP stapling, and prefer TLS 1.3 with modern AEAD ciphers.

Many teams treat TLS configuration at the load balancer as a compatibility setting rather than a security control. In practice, it defines the cryptographic trust boundary for the entire application stack.

NIST’s TLS guidance is especially relevant here because it does not simply list preferred protocols. It explains why older versions introduce unacceptable risk, including downgrade attacks, weak key exchange mechanisms, and deprecated cryptographic primitives. When a load balancer allows legacy TLS for convenience, it creates an attack surface that downstream systems cannot correct.

From an architectural standpoint, enforcing NIST-aligned TLS policies at the load balancer eliminates entire classes of attacks before traffic ever reaches a WAF or application server. It also provides a defensible baseline for audits and regulatory reviews, particularly in financial and healthcare environments where encryption standards are closely scrutinized

Example 2: Retail platform

The site faced massive bot traffic, such as scrapers, credential stuffers, and inventory scalpers. Protections were added inside the application, but the load balancer treated all traffic equally. Automated abuse consumed capacity before deeper security layers even saw it. Legitimate users paid the price.

During peak periods, a large portion of incoming traffic was automated abuse. The business impact was clear: slower pages, failed checkouts, and lost revenue.

What makes the OWASP Automated Threats guide particularly valuable is its focus on scale rather than sophistication. Most automated attacks do not rely on novel exploits. They succeed because they generate high volumes of traffic that look superficially legitimate.

This is where load balancers play a critical role. They see traffic before authentication, before session state, and before business logic is invoked. If every request is forwarded downstream without discrimination, automated abuse can exhaust infrastructure long before application-level controls engage.

By applying rate limits, connection caps, and behavioral thresholds at the load balancer, organizations can disrupt automated attacks at a fraction of the cost.

The turning point: securing the entry layer

Today, when I design systems, the first question I ask isn’t “How fast is it?” but “How much do I trust what enters here?”

I treat the load balancer as a policy enforcement point for encryption, identity, protocol correctness, and abuse prevention. It becomes the first checkpoint in a zero trust path, not just a distributor of packets.

Four key practices at the load balancer

1. Strong encryption and identity at the edge:

Enforce TLS 1.3 where possible

Allow TLS 1.2 only with modern AEAD cipher suites

Disable legacy protocols that enable downgrade attacks

2. Protocol and request sanitation

Normalize and validate traffic before it reaches the app

Reject malformed headers (e.g., duplicate Host headers, invalid characters) and strip hop-by-hop header

3. Bot and abuse control

Implement token bucket rate limiting keyed by IP or session

Detect and block scrapers and credential stuffing early

4. Integration with deeper security layers

The load balancer complements WAF and application security

Enforce transport, identity, and hygiene before semantic inspection

Cloud Security Alliance guidance consistently emphasizes shared responsibility and defense-in-depth.

Why this matters beyond technology

This isn’t just a technical argument, it’s a business one. When applications go down, customers leave. When breaches happen, trust is lost. Both often begin with small design decisions made early in architecture.

A strong edge reduces total cost of ownership by cutting wasted capacity, lowering false positives downstream, and reducing incident response hours.

Why edge security decisions compound over time

Security decisions made at the load balancer tend to compound, for better or worse. A permissive edge may appear harmless at first, especially when applications are small and traffic volumes are manageable. Over time, however, those early choices harden into technical debt.

Allowing weak encryption for compatibility today becomes an exception that must be supported indefinitely. Deferring abuse controls pushes more responsibility onto application teams that are already focused on features and delivery timelines. Pushing request hygiene downstream increases noise for WAFs and intrusion detection systems, leading to alert fatigue and slower incident response.

The opposite is also true. When strong controls are enforced at the entry point, downstream systems benefit immediately. Applications receive cleaner, more predictable traffic. Security tools operate with higher signal and fewer false positives. Infrastructure capacity is preserved for real users instead of being consumed by automated abuse.

This has a measurable business impact. Teams spend less time firefighting performance issues during peak traffic events. Incident response becomes faster because the scope of investigation is smaller. Compliance reviews are easier because baseline controls are consistently enforced at the edge.

Most importantly, a strong entry layer creates architectural flexibility. Applications can evolve, scale, and migrate across environments without redefining security assumptions each time. The load balancer becomes a stable trust boundary, absorbing change while maintaining consistent protection.

These benefits are rarely visible on day one. They become obvious only when something goes wrong, and by then, the quality of the front door determines how much damage occurs.

I used to think application security lived deep inside the stack. Experience taught me otherwise. Every major incident I’ve seen had one thing in common: the attacker entered easily.

That’s why I now say this without hesitation: application security must start at the load balancer. Not because it replaces other controls, but because every system needs a strong front door.

When the front door is strong, everything behind it becomes easier to secure, easier to scale, and easier to trust.

[46] CSO Online - How to make LLMs a defensive advantage without creating a new attack surface

[TAM METİN - 1560 kelime]
LLMs can supercharge your SOC, but if you don’t fence them in, they’ll open a brand-new attack surface while attackers scale faster.

Large language models (LLMs) have arrived in security in three different forms at once: as productivity tools that sit beside analysts, as components embedded inside products and workflows and as targets that attackers can probe, manipulate and steal.

That convergence is why the conversation feels messy. The same capability that can summarize an incident in seconds can also generate a believable pretext for a spear phish. The same assistant that can draft detection logic can also be induced to leak sensitive context if it is wired into internal knowledge bases without guardrails.

I treat LLMs as another high-impact system: define outcomes, model threats and build controls that assume the model will be wrong or manipulated.

How LLMs are changing the work of security teams

When people say “LLMs in the SOC,” they often picture a chat interface. The more meaningful shift is architectural: LLMs make it cheap to translate unstructured security data into structured hypotheses, narratives and next steps. That matters because a large share of security work is not technically difficult. It is context stitching.

If I were rolling out an LLM capability inside a security program, I would start with a narrow set of workflows where the output is advisory and easy to verify. Then I would expand only after the team can measure quality and manage failure modes.

Here are high-value use cases that are well-suited to early adoption:

Alert triage summaries that turn raw telemetry into a short “what happened, why it matters and what I should check next” narrative

Investigation copilots that generate a timeline from logs, tickets and chat transcripts, then highlight gaps and recommended pivots

Detection engineering assistance for drafting Sigma, YARA or query language snippets that an engineer can review and test

Vulnerability management copilots that cluster similar findings, explain exploitability in business terms and propose patch windows

Policy and standards Q&A, where the assistant answers questions by citing the exact internal control language it relied on

Even in these safe scenarios, the operating rule I use is simple: treat the LLM output as untrusted. If a model is allowed to write code, recommend a containment action or reference internal data, you should assume it can hallucinate, be socially engineered or be prompted into unsafe behavior.

The OWASP community has cataloged common failure modes for LLM-enabled applications, including prompt injection, insecure output handling, sensitive information disclosure, excessive agency and overreliance. Those are not academic concepts. They map directly to the ways LLMs fail in security workflows. See OWASP Top 10 for LLM applications.

Practically, I think of an LLM deployment in security as three layers: the model, the data it can see and the actions it can take. You can get significant value by widening the first layer (e.g., by using better models or prompts) while keeping the other two layers constrained.

Three design choices consistently reduce risk without killing value:

Make sources explicit: Use retrieval-augmented generation so the assistant answers from curated documents, tickets or playbooks and show the cited snippets to the analyst.

Keep the model out of the blast radius: The model should not hold secrets. Use short-lived credentials, scoped tokens and brokered access to tools.

Gate actions: Anything that changes a system state (blocking, quarantining, deleting, emailing) should require human approval or a separate policy engine.

Leadership still needs to be clear-eyed about measurement. If you cannot quantify whether the assistant reduces response time or improves signal quality, you are taking on a new class of operational risk for uncertain gain.

How attackers are using the same capability to scale and personalize

Defenders are not the only ones automating context stitching. Attackers can use LLMs to do reconnaissance, craft language and iterate quickly. The result is not new attacks so much as a change in the economics of attackers: cheaper personalization, faster iteration and fewer language barriers.

The most immediate impact is in social engineering. A good phishing email is not just about correct grammar. It is situational relevance: the right tone, the right internal jargon and the right moment in a business process. LLMs make that kind of tailoring trivial at scale.

A 2024 study by Heiding, Lermen, Kao, Schneier and Vishwanath evaluated fully automated spear phishing campaigns validated on human subjects. In their experiment, AI-generated emails performed on par with human experts and far better than a generic phishing control group. The paper is worth reading in full because it quantifies the problem and makes the attacker economics tangible.

At the same time, organizations are creating a new set of soft targets by wiring LLMs into internal knowledge bases, ticketing systems and workflow tools. If an attacker can induce prompt injection through a user-controlled input, a document in a shared repository or a compromised web page that the assistant is allowed to read, the model can become a conduit for data leakage or unsafe actions.

That is why I treat LLM security as both an offensive and defensive discipline. You are defending your organization from LLM-enabled threats and you are defending your own LLM-enabled systems from being turned against you. The UK Department for Science, Innovation and Technology has mapped vulnerabilities across the AI lifecycle from design through maintenance, which is a useful mental model for security teams.

To keep it actionable, I group attacker opportunities into three buckets:

LLMs as persuasion engines: better pretexts, better multilingual scams, better impersonation and better fraud scripting

LLMs as productivity engines: faster iteration on commodity malware, scripts, recon reports and exploit adaptation

LLMs as targets and pivots: stealing prompts, extracting system instructions, poisoning data sources or manipulating tool-using agents

The defensive implication is uncomfortable: some of your existing controls matter more than ever, especially verification, identity proofing and process hardening. If an executive approval workflow can be bypassed with a convincing message, an LLM will help attackers find and exploit that weakness faster.

LLMs also complicate content-based detection. When attackers can generate clean language, I put more weight on technical and behavioral signals (sender authentication, unusual login, anomalous payment request pattern) than on tone or grammar cues.

A control stack that lets you use LLMs without losing the plot

I do not think organizations need a brand-new governance regime for LLMs. They need to apply existing governance muscle to new failure modes. The closest fit is risk management, not model worship.

A helpful anchor is the NIST Artificial Intelligence Risk Management Framework, which organizes activities into govern, map, measure and manage. The value is less in the labels and more in the discipline: define accountability, understand context and impacts, measure risk and then operationalize mitigations.

If I were advising a security and risk committee on an LLM program, I would propose the following control stack. It is intentionally pragmatic and it assumes a mixed environment of third-party models, internal data and tool integrations:

Govern: Define what the model is allowed to do, who owns it and what unsafe means in your context (data classes, regulated workflows, critical decisions)

Map: Document the end-to-end system, including prompts, data sources, retrieval pipelines, plugins and downstream actions; not just the model endpoint

Secure the data: Inventory training, fine-tuning and retrieval corpora, enforce access controls and monitor for poisoning, leakage and unauthorized reuse

Threat model with AI-specific techniques: Map likely adversary behaviors using MITRE ATLAS and include prompt injection and tool abuse in your scenarios

Build guardrails at the boundaries: Input validation, content filtering, output constraints and schema-based parsing for any output that feeds automation

Gate high-impact actions: Require explicit approvals, step-up authentication or policy engine checks before an agent can change state in production

Test like you mean it: Red-team the assistant, run jailbreak and prompt injection suites and measure error rates under realistic loads

Instrument, monitor and respond: Log prompts, tool calls and outputs, detect anomalous usage patterns and maintain a kill switch for unsafe automation

Two pieces of public guidance are worth reading because they translate secure AI into operational steps. First, “Guidelines for secure AI system development” — a document published by UK National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) — provides lifecycle guidance from secure design through secure operation and maintenance. Second, “Deploying AI systems securely” — published jointly by the US National Security Agency’s Artificial Intelligence Security Center (AISC) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), along with other national and international agencies — focuses on best practices for deploying and operating externally developed AI systems.

Finally, I treat excessive agency as a line you cross deliberately. The more autonomy you give an LLM-based agent, the more you are building a new class of privileged software. If you would not give a junior script unfettered API access, you should not give it to a probabilistic model either.

The convergence of LLMs and cybersecurity is not optional. Attackers will use these tools and employees already are. The advantage comes from capturing productivity gains while keeping control of data, identity and change management.

[48] CSO Online - Ransomware groups switch to stealthy attacks and long-term access
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[TAM METİN - 897 kelime]
Attackers are shifting from smash-and-grab operations to “parasitic” residency. CISOs must emphasize identity controls, monitor trusted applications and integrations, and focused detection strategies on persistence.

Ransomware attackers are switching tactics in favor of more stealthy infiltration, as the threat of public exposure of sensitive corporate data is becoming the main mechanism of extortion.

Picus Security’s annual red-teaming report shows attackers shifting away from loud disruption toward quiet, long-term access — or from “predatory” smash-and-grab tactics to “parasitic” silent residency.

Four in five of the most common attack techniques deployed by ransomware strains are designed to stay hidden once attackers gain initial access. For example, ransomware operations are increasingly using defense evasion and persistence techniques as their tradecraft has evolved, according to Picus Security, a cybersecurity firm that specializes in breach and attack simulation.

Attackers are also increasingly routing command-and-control (C2) traffic through trusted enterprise services such as OpenAI and AWS so that malign activity more closely resembles normal business traffic.

Picus Security’s conclusions come from attack simulations combined with an analysis of 1.1 million malicious files and 15.5 million adversarial actions mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

The Picus findings about attackers favoring stealth and persistence over loud disruption are consistent with the findings of ransomware research by Securin, which reports that attackers are chaining vulnerabilities in their attacks on corporate systems.

“Ransomware groups no longer treat vulnerabilities as isolated entry points,” says Aviral Verma, lead threat intelligence analyst at penetration testing and cybersecurity services firm Securin. “They assemble them into deliberate exploitation chains, selecting weaknesses not just for severity, but for how effectively they can collapse trust, persistence, and operational control across entire platforms.”

AI is now widely accessible to threat actors, but it primarily functions as a force multiplier rather than a driving force in ransomware attacks.

Ransomware gangs commonly favor double extortion where blackmail based on the threatened leak of stolen information is combined by the disruption caused by encrypting data after breaking into corporate networks.

Picus reports a 38% drop in encryption over the past 12 months as more cybercriminals turn to silently exfiltrating data for extortion as their main stock in trade.

Picus’ suggestion that the volume of ransomware attacks is dropping is disputed by other experts.

Tony Anscombe, chief security evangelist at endpoint security vendor Eset, offered a contrasting perspective.

“In the recent Eset H2 2025 Threat Report, the detection data shows a 13% increase between H1 and H2, coupled with the number of publicly reported victims increasing by 40% reported via ecrime.ch, then it [ransomware] does not appear to be in decline,” Anscombe tells CSO.

Nick Hyatt, senior threat intelligence consultant at cybersecurity services firm GuidePoint Security, says the data of more than 7,000 victims was publicly posted last year, a figure that likely excludes “victims who paid and were never posted by the threat actor.”

Far from showing any signs of consolidation, the number of active ransomware groups hit an all-time high last year, according to GuidePoint.

“Threat actors streamlined their attack capabilities, using a mix of established techniques, vulnerability exploitation, and novel attacks to execute on their objectives,” says Hyatt.

Experts polled by CSO commonly rated Qilin, Cl0p and Akira as among the most active ransomware groups but there was no shortage of other contenders.

“Akira stands out as the No. 1 ransomware group today from Huntress’ 2025 data,” says Dray Agha, senior manager of security operations at managed detection and response firm Huntress. “Their tradecraft is rapidly evolving specifically to neutralize existing security solutions, and we are seeing them aggressively target the hypervisor level to completely bypass traditional endpoint security protections.”

Collin Hogue-Spears, senior director distinguished technical expert at application security firm Black Duck Software, says that ransomware operators have stopped operating like organized crime and started operating like a platform business.

“Qilin posted over 1,000 victims in 2025, a seven-fold increase over the prior year,” according to Hogue-Spears. “LockBit 5.0 clawed back to operational capacity after its takedown.”

Meanwhile the Scattered Spider/Lapsus$/ShinyHunters (SLSH) federation is running extortion-as-a-service, an approach that makes it easier for less technically skilled cybercriminals to make a dishonest living.

SLSH has created a “structural shift” in the cybercrime ecosystem.

“Seventy-three new groups appeared in six months because they no longer need to build their own tooling,” says Hogue-Spears. “They rent it.”

New threat techniques require security rethink

Vasileios Mourtzinos, a member of the threat team at managed detection and response firm Quorum Cyber, says that more groups are moving away from high-impact encryption towards extortion-led models that prioritize data theft and prolonged, low-noise access.

“This approach, popularized by actors such as Cl0p through large-scale exploitation of third-party and supply chain vulnerabilities, is now being mirrored more widely, alongside increased abuse of valid accounts, legitimate administrative tools to blend into normal activity, and in some cases attempts to recruit or incentivize insiders to facilitate access,” Mourtzinos says.

The evolving tradecraft of ransomware groups should prompt a rethink of defensive strategies.

“For CISOs, the priority should be strengthening identity controls, closely monitoring trusted applications and third-party integrations, and ensuring detection strategies focus on persistence and data exfiltration activity,” Mourtzinos advises.

Einer aktuellen Studie zufolge sind Hacker dank KI innerhalb eines Jahres um 65 Prozent schneller geworden.

Crowdstrike hat die aktuelle Ausgabe seines Global Threat Report veröffentlicht – mit mehreren bemerkenswerten Erkenntnissen.

So benötigte ein Angreifer im Jahr 2025 im Schnitt nur noch 29 Minuten, um sich vollständigen Zugriff auf ein Netzwerk zu verschaffen. Damit läuft die Kompromittierung rund 65 Prozent schneller ab, als im Vorjahr.

Schnellste Breakout-Time aller Zeiten

Die schnellste gemessene Zeit lag sogar bei 27 Sekunden – im Vergleich zu 51 Sekunden im Jahr 2024. In einem Fall begann die Datenexfiltration innerhalb von nur vier Minuten nach dem initialen Zugriff.

Als Hauptgrund für diese Entwicklung führt Crowdstrike den zunehmenden Einsatz von KI-Tools bei Cyberangriffen an. So hätten Angreifer, die KI nutzen, ihre Aktivitäten um 89 Prozent erhöht.

Den Sicherheitsforschern zufolge setzen insbesondere staatlich unterstützte und kriminelle Gruppen zunehmend KI ein, um ihre Angriffe effizienter zu gestalten:

So habe die Russland-nahe Cybercrime-Gruppe „Fancy Bear“ die LLM-basierte Malware „Lamehug“ genutzt, um ihre Informationsbeschaffung zu automatisieren.

Und die Hackerbande „Punk Spider“ konnte mithilfe KI-generierter Skripte sowohl Zugangsdaten deutlich schneller extrahieren als auch forensische Spuren beseitigen.

Die Nordkorea-nahe Gruppe „Famous Chollima“ wiederum setzte KI-generierte Identitäten ein, um Insider-Operationen im größeren Maßstab durchzuführen.

„Es ist ein Wettrüsten im Bereich der Künstlichen Intelligenz“, erklärt Adam Meyers, Head of Counter Adversary Operations bei CrowdStrike. „Die Breakout-Time ist das deutlichste Signal, wie sich die Angriffe verändert haben. KI verkürzt die Zeit zwischen Intention und Durchführung und macht gleichzeitig KI-Systeme in Unternehmen zu Zielen. Security-Teams müssen schneller sein als die Angreifer, um zu gewinnen.“

[50] CSO Online - China-linked hackers used Google Sheets to spy on telecoms and governments across 42 countries

[TAM METİN - 844 kelime]
The GRIDTIDE backdoor concealed its traffic within routine spreadsheet activity for years before Google shut down the operation last week.

Google has disrupted a China-linked espionage group that used Google’s spreadsheet application as a covert spy tool to compromise telecom providers and government agencies across 42 countries, sending commands and receiving stolen data through it, Google’s Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) said on Thursday.

Working with Mandiant, GTIG confirmed intrusions at 53 organizations across 42 countries, with suspected infections in at least 20 more. The group, identified by Google as UNC2814, is a suspected PRC-nexus actor that GTIG has tracked since 2017.

“This prolific, elusive actor has a long history of targeting international governments and global telecommunications organizations across Africa, Asia, and the Americas,” GTIG said in a blog post.

Unlike Salt Typhoon, UNC2814, the China-linked group whose intrusions into US telecom carriers drew scrutiny from Congress and federal regulators last year, operates with distinct tactics and targets a different set of victims globally, the post added.

How UNC2814 gains its initial foothold has not been determined, though GTIG said the group has a history of exploiting and compromising web servers and edge systems. Once inside, it deployed a novel backdoor and maintained persistent access across target networks.

A spreadsheet repurposed as a spy tool

That backdoor, which GTIG named GRIDTIDE, did not communicate the way most malware does. “The backdoor leverages Google Sheets as a high-availability C2 platform, treating the spreadsheet not as a document, but as a communication channel to facilitate the transfer of raw data and shell commands,” GTIG said.

The attackers wrote commands into spreadsheet cells and retrieved stolen data from them the same way. The malware polled the sheet every second for new instructions, wrote status updates back on task completion, and wiped the first 1,000 rows at the start of each session to erase traces of prior activity, the blog post explained.

“This activity is not the result of a security vulnerability in Google’s products; rather, it abuses legitimate Google Sheets API functionality to disguise C2 traffic,” GTIG added.

“The most unsettling detail about the GRIDTIDE backdoor is how it abuses legitimate Google Sheets API calls to function as its C2 channel, while still utilizing techniques like ‘living off the land’ to blend in with regular enterprise activities,” Andrew Costis, manager of the Adversary Research Team at AttackIQ, said. “This camouflage buys attackers time by slipping past the triggers defenders rely on, like obvious malware signatures or noisy beaconing, and hiding inside the same cloud app patterns teams are used to seeing.”

How Mandiant found it

The campaign came to light during a Mandiant Threat Defense investigation, when analysts flagged unusual activity on a CentOS server. A binary named xapt, designed to masquerade as the apt package manager on Debian-based Linux systems, had already escalated to root and was running shell commands to confirm its access level, GTIG said.

The attacker had the highest available privileges on the system before the alert was raised.

From that foothold, the threat actor used a service account to move laterally via SSH, deployed living-off-the-land binaries for reconnaissance, and installed GRIDTIDE as a persistent systemd service to survive reboots. The threat actor also deployed SoftEther VPN Bridge to maintain an encrypted outbound channel.

“VPN configuration metadata suggests UNC2814 has been leveraging this specific infrastructure since July 2018,” GTIG said.

The extent of that access became clear when investigators examined what the attackers were targeting.

The real target was individuals

The attackers planted GRIDTIDE on endpoints that held personally identifiable information, including full names, phone numbers, dates of birth, voter IDs, and national ID numbers.

“We assess the targeting of PII in this engagement is consistent with cyber espionage activity in telecommunications, which is primarily leveraged to identify, track, and monitor persons of interest,” GTIG said in the post.

GTIG did not directly observe exfiltration during this campaign, but noted that “historical PRC-nexus espionage intrusions against telecoms have resulted in the theft of call data records, unencrypted SMS messages, and the compromise and abuse of lawful intercept systems.”

Chinese cyberespionage groups have consistently prioritized telecommunications as a target precisely because of the access their networks provide to sensitive communications and lawful intercept infrastructure.

“When telecom firms and government agencies are in the blast radius, the stakes go beyond one company’s incident report,” Costis said. “Access to telecom environments can enable broad intelligence collection, help map relationships, and create opportunities for long-term monitoring that is hard to unravel once compromised.”

To dismantle the operation, GTIG terminated all Google Cloud projects controlled by the attackers, disabled their accounts, revoked Google Sheets API access, and sinkholed current and historical C2 domains. It said it has also notified affected organizations and published indicators of compromise through Google Threat Intelligence, including IP addresses, domains, and file hashes tied to UNC2814.

[51] CSO Online - The farmers and the mercenaries: Rethinking the ‘human layer’ in security

[TAM METİN - 984 kelime]
Why we're asking the wrong people to save us.

There’s a phrase that’s become gospel in cybersecurity: “Employees are the last line of defense.”

We’ve built an entire industry around it. Billions of dollars in security awareness programs, mandatory simulations and user-reporting workflows across endpoints, applications and collaboration tools. All predicated on a premise that sounds reasonable until you examine what we’re actually asking.

Here’s what we’re asking: for the marketing coordinator, the accounts payable clerk and the sales rep to catch what sophisticated security tools and trained professionals missed.

That’s not a security strategy. That’s asking farmers to repel mercenaries.

The hierarchy we don’t talk about

Think of the actual defensive capabilities in a typical organization.

Your security team has years of specialized training, access to SIEM platforms, threat intelligence feeds and forensics tools. Their full-time job is defense.

Your CISO has decades of experience, strategic visibility across the organization and the authority to make architectural decisions. Defense is their entire professional identity.

Your employees have a short annual training module, a reporting workflow and whatever attention they can spare from the job they were actually hired to do.

We’ve built a multi-billion dollar industry around the idea that the third group will succeed where the first two are failing.

The evidence is already in

This isn’t a theoretical complaint — it shows up in research on how real SOCs work. A study by the University of Oxford based on surveys and interviews with SOC practitioners found they “confirmed the high” false-positive rates of tools in use, and that many “false positives” are actually benign triggers that still require human validation.

That’s not employee failure. That’s employees doing exactly what we trained them to do — and the training is producing volume rather than clarity.

User reporting systems have become noise amplifiers. Employees are encouraged to flag anything that feels out of pattern: unusual access prompts, unexpected system messages, automated workflows, new integrations, time-sensitive requests. These signals once indicated risk. Today, they often reflect how modern, automated businesses actually operate. The cues we taught employees to distrust increasingly describe normal work.

Meanwhile, SOC teams are drowning. It’s not just the queues — it’s the human cost. ISACA’s 2024 research found 66% of cybersecurity professionals say the job is more stressful now than it was five years ago, citing a more complex threat landscape alongside resourcing constraints.

And our answer is: the accountants will save us.

Here’s the contrarian take the industry needs to hear: the ‘human layer’ that matters isn’t your employees. It’s your security team.

When we talk about the human element in security, we should be talking about the CISOs running on four hours of sleep during an incident. The analysts pattern-matching across thousands of signals. The threat hunters who notice something slightly off in authentication logs. The architects who see the structural weakness before it becomes a breach.

These are elite defenders. Trained professionals. The actual human intelligence in your security posture.

If they can’t keep up — if their capacity is consumed by false positive triage, user-submitted reports, operational escalations and the constant pressure to clear queues — then no amount of awareness training for end users is going to close that gap.

You don’t compensate for overwhelmed special forces by handing rifles to farmers.

The uncomfortable math

Let me walk through what’s actually happening in most organizations:

The security team receives hundreds of alerts daily. Many originate from automated controls, user reporting workflows and precautionary detections designed to err on the side of caution. A significant percentage require investigation — you can’t know something is harmless until you look. Each investigation takes 15–20 minutes. The math quickly consumes 100% of available analyst capacity.

When false positive volume hits capacity, strategic threat hunting drops to zero. There’s no time for pattern recognition across multiple signals, correlation with threat intelligence or the slow careful analysis that catches sophisticated attacks.

The sophisticated attacks don’t announce themselves. They wait in queue, looking like everything else. Detection becomes random — a function of luck, not design.

This is the crisis facing the actual human layer of defense. And we’re addressing it by asking frontline employees to identify subtle anomalies in systems and workflows that already passed through layers of automated controls.

I’m not arguing that baseline security hygiene is worthless. Employees should follow sensible practices and avoid obviously risky behavior. Basic discipline matters.

But we’ve elevated awareness training from ‘basic hygiene’ to ‘strategic defense,’ and that elevation is dangerous. It creates a false sense of coverage. It allows organizations to underinvest in actual defensive capability because they’ve ‘addressed the human element.’

The human element that needs addressing is your security team’s capacity. Their tools, their processes, their ability to do strategic work instead of drowning in noise.

Even regulators and standards bodies implicitly acknowledge the same bottleneck: monitoring has to be implemented in a way that minimizes false positives and false negatives — because human review capacity is finite.

The question worth asking

Every CISO should be asking: What percentage of my security team’s capacity is consumed by work that doesn’t actually reduce risk?

If the answer is ‘most of it’ — if your analysts spend their days clearing precautionary alerts, reviewing benign activity and responding to internal escalations driven by uncertainty rather than threat — then you have a human layer problem.

But the solution isn’t more training for end users. It’s restoring capacity to the people actually trained to defend you.

The farmers have fields to tend. Let them farm.

The question is whether your mercenaries have room to fight.

[52] CSO Online - 5 trends that should top CISO’s RSA 2026 agendas
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[TAM METİN - 1485 kelime]
AI will dominate RSA’s presentations and discussions. To separate hopeful hype from practical solutions, security leaders should approach the conference with curiosity, optimism, suspicion, and a strategic plan.

RSA 2026 is still weeks away and the hype machine is humming. This year’s theme, “The Power of Community,” is somewhat ironic as the overwhelming chatter at the Moscone Center in San Francisco from March 23 to March 26 will be about AI agents, not humans.

Welcome to the cybersecurity community, agents, automatons, and robots!

While cybersecurity is an extremely diverse area covering everything from humans to critical infrastructure, here are five cybersecurity areas certain to have a starring role at RSA 2026 — and worthy of being on any CISO’s attendance agenda.

The rise of the AI-SOC

In 2026, we are moving beyond AI copilots toward autonomous agents performing traditional security operations center (SOC) activities such as triaging alerts, investigating malicious activity, isolating hosts, and patching software on our behalf. The trend is expected to reshape operations in the SOC even if the early realities haven’t yet fully aligned with agentic expectations.

Still, there’s a lot of innovation happening from established vendors (e.g., Cisco/Splunk, CrowdStrike, Google, Microsoft, etc.) and startups (e.g., Andesite, Crogl, Prophet Security, etc.) alike. While AI-SOCs have potential, security pros remain leery about AI hallucinations and “black box” tools, and agents will succeed or fail based on a foundation of accurate and timely data access — threat intelligence, log files, tools integration, and so on.

For RSA attendees, I recommend cautious optimism. One way or another the AI-SOC is coming — and sooner than you think. But CISOs should come prepared with requirements, lots of questions, and a willingness to cast a wide net rather than simply defaulting to existing tools vendors.

CTEM in the spotlight

In another evolutionary trend, most organizations are moving beyond scanning for software snafus to continuous threat exposure management (CTEM). By doing so, security teams hope to get a full picture of all assets, as well as their configurations, locations, software vulnerabilities, ownership, and business criticality.

Armed with this data, CTEM platforms look at threat intelligence to assess adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), helping organizations prioritize which vulnerable assets represent the highest risks to the business. Some tools can even predict which assets may be most vulnerable to future exploits.

CTEM tools from vendors such as Nucleus Security, ServiceNow (Armis), and Tenable (Vulcan Security) will be front and center at RSA but there’s a confusing cast of thousands in this space. While promising, CTEM done wrong will just add another tool to the security stack.

Before succumbing to the shining objects at RSA, security teams should audit — and clean up — their data, define “crown jewel” assets, create their own risk scoring system, and build a mobilization plan for emergency and day-to-day patching processes between security and IT teams.

Cyber resilience takes center stage

According to Special Publication 800-160, Volume 2, from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), cyber resilience is defined as: “The ability to anticipate, withstand, recover from, and adapt to adverse conditions, stresses, attacks, or compromises on systems that use or are enabled by cyber resources.”

Note the expansive definition. Anticipating threats requires threat intelligence analysis, solid and continuous exposure management, and effective security controls. Withstanding and recovering from threats demands rapid detection, incident response, solid data backup and restoration, and a formal — and tested — business continuity and disaster recovery plan. Adapting involves security technology tuning, detection rules engineering, targeted investments, and CISO leadership.

Obviously, there’s no one product that covers the entire spectrum but that won’t stop some vendors from claiming they are in the cyber-resilience business. Caveat emptor, my cybersecurity friends.

Identity as the ‘new’ security perimeter

Anyone remember the Jericho Forum circa 2004? The group argued that since data was moving outside the corporate network, security should be attached to data and user identity, rather than the physical or logical network location. Twenty-two years later, some vendors have had a similar epiphany about identity management.

Okay, beyond my snark, I’m encouraged by the focus on identity management in areas like improved identity governance (SailPoint, Saviynt), passwordless authentication (Microsoft, Okta, Ping), and identity threat detection and response (Grip Security, Permiso Security).

There is also copious use of AI in the identity space to assess user entitlements, user “liveness,” and identity configuration settings. Great stuff, but I’ve always found that identity and access management (IAM) is an area where everyone has an ownership stake but no one actually owns it. CISOs will have to work with business owners, CIOs, and application developers to address identity risks, making strategic projects lengthy and complex — a difficult environment for security startups.

Everything AI: Future-proofing security operations

All the areas above have an AI component, of course, but it’s worth carving out a discussion on AI across those and other AI cybersecurity categories here.

First, CISOs face a significant challenge in their need to secure the development and usage of AI. This includes buckets of technologies, such as model context protocol (MCP) security, AI firewalling, content sanitation, digital content authenticity, AI security posture management, AI-driven DevSecOps, and so on. These technologies should support an overall business and technology strategy and governance framework around AI.

Next, RSA will be a hotbed of AI threat chatter, with alarming discussions about vulnerability chaining, polymorphic payloads, and security control bypassing — all legitimate topics, but like defenders, adversaries are mostly using AI for research and process automation.

Attendees should focus on relevant threat intelligence while discarding profuse hype. There are too many AI sub-topics to cover, but in my humble opinion, RSA participants should pay special attention to AI-centric skills and training sessions. Given an AI-enabled future, organizations will need security data engineers and AI security specialists, rare skill sets today. And as we supplant Tier-1 analyst functions with AI, we’ll also need to upskill junior cybersecurity specialists to become AI orchestrators who excel at human-agent teaming. AI skills development and training should be a top CISO priority.

Beyond my personal top 5, here are a few honorable mentions for CISO RSA 2026 agendas:

Zero trust. This area rides shotgun with identity management and cyber-resilience strategies. As such, zero trust is still a top priority. CISOs should have an eye out for AI-enabled innovation that could accelerate their ZT implementation.

Cloud security. Between multicloud, SaaS, and AI development, cloud security remains a bear. Organizations need an organic security strategy that grows with their cloud usage. CISOs should use the conference to help hone their growing multi-cloud/SaaS security needs.

Cybersecurity platforms. There is lots of vendor money in this area as well. Security platforms are likely appropriate for most smaller firms but perhaps not for larger enterprises where the business and IT run far faster than cybersecurity. CISOs must weigh the benefits of platform efficiency against tools efficacy and rip-and-replace pain.

*DR. CDR, EDR, and XDR (etc.), oh my! There’s lots of detection and response innovation around the edges of the cloud and network that will likely lead to highly distributed security operations. CISOs should explore how these blending and evolving spaces will impact a future centralized or distributed security operations architecture.

IT and OT security. Yeah, we’ve been talking about this for years, but AI will be a force multiplier for smart devices and edge computing. For example, in the next five years, healthcare will transform based on wearable connected devices for data collection and patient care, so device availability and integrity could equate to life and death situations. Security teams can’t be left behind. Be on the lookout for evolutions in how to further secure IT/OT convergence and purpose-built AI agents for IoT/OT security.

Post quantum cryptography (PQC).  To me, this topic is hit or miss.  CISOs working for intelligence agencies, defense contractors, or financial services firms should pay attention.  Others can probably eschew this area – at least this year.

The power of community. There’s that theme again, but this isn’t hyperbole. Cybersecurity professionals already learn from each other at RSA and Black Hat, and through professional groups like the Information Systems Security Association (ISSA). I’m hoping that agents can join the community in an era of collective defense — where many organizations band together in real-time to protect one another.

With the proliferation of AI, this year’s RSA will feature more eye candy than in the past. Vendors pay millions of dollars for the chance to over stimulate users in this way. As always, security professionals should approach RSA with a list of requirements that support business strategy and technical needs. Eschew AI gaga and remember the sage words of Bruce Schneier, “Security is a process, not a product.”

Cybersicherheitsexperten verlassen sich in diversen Bereichen auf Open-Source-Lösungen – nicht zuletzt weil diese im Regelfall von einer lebendigen und nutzwertigen Community gestützt werden. Aber auch weil es inzwischen Hunderte qualitativ hochwertiger, quelloffener Optionen gibt, um Breaches und Datenlecks auf allen Ebenen des Unternehmens-Stacks zu verhindern.

Falls Sie nun gedanklich bereits die xz-utils-Backdoor-Keule bereitlegen: Ja, es kann sein, dass es in der Zukunft zu weiteren Vorfällen dieser Art kommt. Allerdings darf bezweifelt werden, dass eine ähnliche Schwachstelle in einem proprietären Stack ebenso schnell entdeckt worden wäre. Schließlich ermöglicht Open Source erst, dass unabhängige Sicherheitsexperten Probleme wie diesen zeitnah auf die Spur kommen können. Um es kurz zu machen: Die Vorteile von Open Source Tools überwiegen – auch im Bereich der Cybersicherheit – die möglichen Gefahren.

Auf die folgenden quelloffenen Security-Tools sollten CSOs, CISOs und ihre Teams nicht verzichten. Beispielsweise, um:

Schwachstellen zu identifizieren,

Protokolle zu analysieren,

Support für Threat Intelligence und Verschlüsselung sicherzustellen.

Support für Threat Intelligence und Verschlüsselung sicherzustellen.

1. ZAP für Vulnerability Scans

Bei Zed Attack Proxy – kurz ZAP – handelt es sich um ein kostenloses Open-Source-Werkzeug für Penetrationstests. Das Scanner-Tool ist darauf konzipiert, potenzielle Schwachstellen und Sicherheitslücken in Webanwendungen aufzuspüren und stützt sich dazu auf umfangreiches Community-Wissen.

Dabei sitzt ZAP zwischen Browser und der zu testenden Web-App und ist in der Lage, sämtliche Packets zu modifizieren, während es mögliche Angriffsvektoren durchläuft. Im Grunde handelt es sich um einen Proxy mit erweiterten Fähigkeiten, um nach Schwachstellen zu suchen. Dazu stellt ZAP eine Sammlung vordefinierter Angriffsmethoden zur Verfügung. Um auf spezifische Risiken zu testen, kann das quelloffene Tool auch mit benutzerdefinierten Payloads und Regeln ausgestattet werden.

ZAP wird aktiv weiterentwickelt und kann mit Blick auf kommende Features eine ambitionierte Roadmap vorweisen. Optimiertes Scripting ist dort ebenso vertreten wie ein breiterer Support für Protokolle wie gRPC. Das Tool steht in Form diverser Installer für alle gängigen Betriebssysteme zum Download zur Verfügung.

2. Wireshark für Paketanalysen

Ein Auge auf die Kommunikationslinien im Netzwerk zu werfen, ist eine der zielführendsten Methoden, um Datenlecks aufzuspüren. Für diese Zwecke ist Wireshark ein ebenso bewährtes wie hochwertiges Tool: Es analysiert die Bits, die sich durch – kabelgebundene oder auch kabellose – Netzwerke bewegen und gleicht diese mit einem Regelwerk ab, das wiederum auf den Informationen Hunderter verschiedener Networking-Quellen fußt.

Wenn Sie sich für eine bestimmte Art von Daten-Traffic interessieren, die von einem spezifischen Softwarepaket ausgeht, ist es zudem möglich, dafür entsprechende Filter zu definieren. Auch dieses Open-Source-Tool läuft auf den meisten gängigen Betriebssystemen – inklusive aller Unix-Variationen.

Die Wireshark-Community ist in den letzten Jahren weiter gewachsen und engagiert sich insbesondere in Sachen Dokumentation und Schulungsmaterialien, wie ein Blick auf die offizielle Webseite unterstreicht.

3. Bloodhound Community Edition für Incident Response

Tritt ein Security Breach auf, nutzen Security-Profis Forensik-Tools, um die Angriffswege der Angreifer nachzuvollziehen. Das geht beispielsweise mit Bloodhound Community Edition, der Open-Source-Version des bekannten Enterprise-Tools (die vom selben Team gepflegt wird).

Das Open-Source-Werkzeug sorgt für Transparenz im Beziehungsgeflecht zwischen Active-Directory- und Azure-Umgebungen und ist so in der Lage, auch hochkomplexe “Attack Paths” zu identifizieren und die in diesem Rahmen gefundenen Sicherheitslücken zu schließen. Das Tool ist sowohl für Red- als auch für Blue Teams geeignet.

4. Autopsy für Cyberforensik

Bei Autopsy handelt es sich um eine quelloffene IT-Forensik-Plattform, um Festplatten(-Images) gründlich zu untersuchen. Dabei lässt sich die Software über zahlreiche Module auch erweitern, um spezifische Datentypen, die mit bestimmten Kompromittierungsarten in Verbindung stehen, zu identifizieren.

Beispielsweise untersucht das “Extension Mismatch Module” die interne Struktur von Dateien und gleicht diese mit ihrer Benennung ab. Entstehen hierbei Diskrepanzen, ist das ein erster Hinweis darauf, dass Angreifer den Traffic nutzen, um etwas zu verbergen. Darüber hinaus bietet Autopsy unter anderem auch Erweiterungsmodule für Schulungen und Support.

5. MISP für Threat Intelligence

Geht es um breit angelegte, kollektive Bemühungen, können Open-Source-Tools und -Plattformen glänzen. Die Malware Information Sharing Platform – kurz MISP – ist dafür das beste Beispiel. Die Plattform kommt ins Spiel, wenn es darum geht, die Daten von IT-Forensik-Tools zu analysieren: Sie sammelt Informationen über potenzielle Angriffsvektoren in einer umfassenden Datenbank und bietet die Möglichkeit, diese Informationen über eine Suchmaschine mit eigenen Daten zu korrelieren. Dabei unterstützt die Lösung ein flexibles, objektbasiertes Datenmodell, das verschiedene Kompromittierungsindikatoren (Indicators of Compromise, IoC) visualisiert und sowohl über technische als auch nicht-technische Details Auskunft gibt. Ein Indexierungsalgorithmus der Support für “Fuzzy Matching” bietet, deckt mögliche Übereinstimmungen automatisch auf.

MISP wurde gezielt für Sicherheitsteams entwickelt, um über geteilte Timelines und Event-Graphen zusammenzuarbeiten. Dieses quelloffene Projekt wird von der Europäischen Union unterstützt und erfreut sich diverser, umfassender Communities. Die webbasierten, größtenteils in PHP geschriebenen Tools von MISP stehen auch in Quellcode-Form zum Download zur Verfügung.

6. Let’s Encrypt für Verschlüsselung

Verschlüsselungsalgorithmen schaffen die Basis für Security, Datenschutz und Authentifizierung und sind in einer ganzen Reihe von quelloffenen Bibliotheken verfügbar. Zudem stützen sich auch viele Open-Source-Tools auf diese Algorithmen.

Zum Beispiel die Skript-Sammlung Let’s Encrypt. Sie ist darauf ausgelegt, Systemadministratoren das Leben leichter zu machen, indem sie Webserver mit Encryption-Fähigkeiten ausstattet. Dazu müssen die Admins nur einige Fragen beantworten – die entsprechenden Zertifikate für die Benutzer werden automatisiert generiert und gewährleisten, dass alle Daten die in diesem Rahmen übertragen werden, geschützt sind.

7. GNU Privacy Guard für Verschlüsselung

Eine vollständige Implementierung des PGP-Standards zum Zwecke des Kommunikationsschutzes bietet GNU Privacy Guard.

Die Zielsetzung besteht dabei darin, die Endbenutzer zu befähigen, ihre E-Mail-Nachrichten zu verschlüsseln und zu signieren. Dabei werden sowohl Secure-Shell- als auch S/MIME-Interaktionen unterstützt.

8. Yara für Pattern Matching

Wenn Malware-Samples identifiziert und klassifiziert werden sollen, verlassen sich viele Schadsoftwarespezialisten auf das Open-Source-Projekt Yara.

Das quelloffene Tool kann jedoch noch mehr und ist auch in Sachen Incident Response und IT-Forensik hilfreich: Es sucht auf Grundlage vorkonfigurierter und benutzerdefinierter Regeln nach identischen Mustern in Dateien oder auch laufenden Prozessen. Zusätzlich können auch Signaturinformationen von Viren über das quelloffene Tool ClamAV sowie Regelsätze aus dem von der Community gepflegten YaraRules-Repository einfließen. Wichtig ist an dieser Stelle, sich der Grenzen der signaturbasierten Erkennung bewusst zu sein – und sich nicht ausschließlich auf dieses Open-Source-Werkzeug zu verlassen.

Yara kann entweder über die Kommandozeile ausgeführt werden oder über eine Python-Bibliothek in entsprechende Skripte integriert werden.

9. OSquery für Endpunktabfragen

Einfach per SQL-Abfrage nach bösartigen Prozessen, Plugins oder auch Sicherheitslücken auf Windows-, Mac- und Linux-Endpunkten zu suchen – das ist die Idee hinter OSquery, einem quelloffenen Tool, das von Softwareingenieuren bei Facebook entwickelt wurde.

Die Software sammelt Betriebssysteminformationen wie laufende Prozesse, geladene Kernelmodule, offene Netzwerkverbindungen, Browser-Plugins oder Datei-Hashes in einer relationalen Datenbank. Diese können Sie mit einfachen SQL Queries abfragen – ganz ohne komplexen Python-Code. Damit löst OSquery ein bedeutendes Problem auf unkomplizierte und elegante Weise.

Zu den Komponenten des Tools gehören die interaktive OSqueryi-Shell, die mit PowerShell genutzt werden kann sowie der Daemon OSqueryd, der für (Low-Level) Host Monitoring zum Einsatz kommt, und es ermöglicht, Datenbankabfragen zu planen. (fm)

[TAM METİN - 1900 kelime]
Phishing email campaigns are so common that it takes something fundamentally different to stand out. We recently found campaigns using a novel, previously unreported method to get around security controls. Actors are abusing the .arpa top-level domain (TLD), in conjunction with IPv6 tunnels, to host phishing content on domains that should not resolve to an IP address. Unlike familiar TLDs like .com and .net, that are used for domains that host web content, the .arpa TLD has a special role in the domain name system (DNS): it’s primarily used to map IP addresses to domains, providing reverse records. Threat actors have discovered a feature in the DNS record management control of certain providers, which allows them to add IP address records for .arpa domains. From there, they can do whatever they like at the hosting provider. It’s a pretty clever trick.

The spam emails in the phishing campaigns we analyzed impersonate major brands and promise a free prize. The messages only display an image, which hides an embedded hyperlink that will take the victim to a malicious website, often through a series of redirects via a traffic distribution system (TDS). The novel feature of this attack is that these image links use a reverse DNS string (used to reverse-map an IP address to a domain name via a PTR record) rather than a standard domain name. For example:

d.d.e.0.6.3.0.0.0.7.4.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa

If the user realized they were being sent to a long domain like this, they would probably be alarmed but in these campaigns the domain is hidden. When the user clicks on the image, the device will resolve the .arpa domain. Because .arpa is a critical TLD for the operation of the internet, these domain names are unlikely to be blocked. From the initial link, the user is typically fingerprinted and redirected to fraudulent content. Figure 1 shows an example of the spam HTML.

Figure 1. An example of the HTML of a phishing email using a reverse DNS string, rather than a standard domain name

To make this attack work, the threat actor acquires some IPv6 address space, for which they are delegated control of the corresponding .arpa subdomain. Then, instead of adding the expected PTR records, they create A records for the reverse DNS names. We have seen threat actors abuse Hurricane Electric and Cloudflare to create these records—both of which have good reputations that actors leverage—and we confirmed that some other DNS providers also allow these configurations. Our tests were not exhaustive, but we notified the providers where we discovered a gap. Figure 2 depicts the process the threat actor used to create the domain used in the phishing emails.

Figure 2. An overview of the process used to abuse the .arpa TLD in phishing emails

The same toolkit used in the .arpa abuse phishing campaign appears to be used by multiple actors since at least 2017. In addition to the .arpa tactic, we have also observed these phishing campaigns using several other methods to bypass security controls, including hijacking dangling CNAMEs and subdomain shadowing. Dangling CNAME hijacks are typically DNS records for expired domains or abandoned cloud services and take advantage of highly reputable organizations. While this blog is focused on introducing the IPv6 / arpa trick, dangling CNAMEs remain a major threat to organizations of all shapes and sizes. For this reason, we’ve included a short section on this topic.

How .arpa Can Be Abused

The most well-known type of DNS query is the one used to identify the IP address or addresses for a given domain name: the type A query. Conversely, a reverse DNS lookup is performed to identify the domain name or names associated with a given IP address. A reverse DNS domain is built from the IP address. This process involves reversing the bytes of the IPv4 address or nibbles of an IPv6 address and appending a special domain within the .arpa TLD (in-addr.arpa for IPv4 addresses and ip6.arpa for IPv6 addresses).

Figure 3 shows the process the actors used to turn their IPv6 IP address range into a domain they could use in phishing emails. For a normal reverse DNS lookup, the entire IP address is needed to calculate the reverse DNS string. However, since the threat actor operates a /64 range, the last 64 bits of the address can be ignored. To make their reverse DNS domains harder to detect and block, they prepend the domain with a randomly generated subdomain to make each FQDN unique.

Figure 3. The process to create a reverse DNS lookup string of an IPv6 address range and then create a unique FQDN using the string. Green additions are part of the normal process of building an IPv6 reverse DNS domain from an address range and the red addition is made by the actor.

Reverse DNS domains are only intended for internet infrastructure purposes, but DNS can be challenging to implement correctly and there are sometimes unintended behaviors. Figure 4 shows what happened when we performed a type A query on one of the reverse DNS domains in the phishing emails. DNS servers were queried until the authoritative server for the domain was found. In this case, the authoritative name servers were operated by Cloudflare. Using these name servers, the reverse DNS FQDN resolved to two IP addresses. Both IP addresses belonged to Cloudflare’s edge network, which hides the actual host of—in this case—the malicious content. Although reverse DNS domains aren’t supposed to work like this, the threat actors found a way to make it happen.

Figure 4. The series of DNS queries used to resolve an IPv6 reverse DNS domain to an A record of a phishing actor

While the idea of reverse FQDNs may seem straightforward, there are several potential gotchas that need to be addressed for this attack to work properly. It relies on the coordinated abuse of two different services: getting a free IPv6 tunnel and getting name servers that resolve the reverse DNS domain to the owner’s content. The IPv6 tunnel encapsulates IPv6 traffic and sends it over IPv4, but the actor doesn’t need or use the tunnel. It’s simply an easy way to get administrative access to a free IPv6 range. The tunnel isn’t surprising, but the ability to claim ownership of a .arpa domain with a DNS provider is. Given the reserved nature of the .arpa TLD, we wouldn’t expect it to be as easy as entering the domain in a web form. When we evaluated a few DNS providers to check if they were vulnerable, this was the point in the process that was ultimately the determining factor. If the provider prevented us from claiming ownership of a .arpa domain, either by explicitly denying the request or by the request failing, we considered the DNS provider not vulnerable.

There’s More to the Story

Another notable tactic we have observed in the phishing email hyperlinks is the abuse of subdomains of high-profile, legitimate domains. We found over 100 instances where the threat actor used hijacked CNAMEs of well-known government agencies, universities, telecommunication companies, media organizations, and retailers. Five of the hijacked CNAMEs we observed were previously reported in August 2024 as being used in phishing attacks. The others appear not to be publicly known. We also saw a few cases of domain shadowing, in which an actor-controlled subdomain is created, typically through credential theft. The lure images are unrelated to the hijacked domains. As with the IPv6 reverse domains, victims are unlikely to ever notice them.

We have observed the same hijacked CNAMEs in phishing emails consistently since September 2025. Some were used in over 100 different emails in a single day. Some (including shadow subdomains) appear to have been abused for years; one shadow subdomain has operated since 2020, seemingly without detection.

Many of the CNAMEs appear to have been hijacked one at a time. There are a few instances, though, where a single domain expiring creates many dangling CNAMEs. Some examples:

At one point, the domain publicnoticessites[.]com provided public notice content for over 120 different local newspaper websites. When it expired, the threat actor purchased the domain and gained access to all the CNAMEs that referenced the domain, eight of which we observed in phishing emails.

A similar situation occurred when hobsonsms[.]com expired. The domain provided account services for at least three different universities through the same subdomain account[.]hobsonsms[.]com. Setting up that one subdomain allowed the threat actor to hijack all three.

It isn’t just smaller organizations that have this problem. The domain hyfnrsx1[.]com had subdomains that served as CNAMEs for global food and beverage companies and just recently expired. Hijacked CNAMEs for both companies were observed in phishing emails starting January 2026.

The phishing emails in these campaigns are simple, usually consisting of a hyperlinked lure image. The lure itself frequently promises a “free gift” for completing a survey. Of course they need the victim’s credit card to pay for shipping, but that shouldn’t be much, right? Other lures include claims that an online subscription or service has been interrupted or that the user has exceeded their cloud storage quota. We’ve provided examples of some of the lures in Figure 5.

Figure 5. The phishing emails use a variety of lures to entice users into clicking on the hyperlinked image. The embedded malicious domain is not related to the impersonated brand in the image.

Once victims click on the lure image, they are redirected to one of several TDSs, the exact one depends on the campaign. It initially takes them to a page that analyzes their traffic. If it meets specific criteria, the victim is redirected through a series of domains until they ultimately land on the malicious phishing page. Each domain in the redirection chain performs its own checks and if the victim doesn’t meet the criteria, they will get an HTTP error such as this, or be redirected to a benign page such as TikTok, as shown here. We don’t have access to the specific criteria in the various stages of the redirection chain, but we were able to determine that a combination of being on a mobile device and using a residential IP address increased our chances of getting redirected to the malicious landing page.

Threat actors are constantly looking for new ways to evade detection, and most techniques are variations on familiar themes. The abuse of the .arpa TLD is novel in that it weaponizes infrastructure that is implicitly trusted and essential for network operations. By using IPv6 reverse DNS domains as malicious links, the threat actor has discovered a delivery mechanism that bypasses security tools. The impact is immediate and cannot be overstated: security that depends on detecting suspicious domains using things like reputation, registration information, and policy blocklists is ineffective for these domains. These domains have an implicitly clean reputation, no registration information, and aren’t usually blocked by policy.

To date we have not observed any queries to these kinds of domains in customer traffic. However, we have observed queries to numerous IPv6 and IPv4 reverse DNS domains, including the ones observed in phishing emails, in our global passive DNS.

The table below provides a selection of the indicators of activity observed in these phishing campaigns. Note, indicators are associated legitimate services and namespaces that have been abused. In all cases, careful consideration should be made before blocking.
