[1] The Hacker News - UnsolicitedBooker Targets Central Asian Telecoms With LuciDoor and MarsSnake Backdoors

The threat activity cluster known as UnsolicitedBooker has been observed targeting telecommunications companies in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, marking a shift from prior attacks aimed at Saudi Arabian entities.

The attacks involve the deployment of two distinct backdoors codenamed LuciDoor and MarsSnake, according to a report published by Positive Technologies last week.

"The group used several unique and rare instruments of Chinese origin," researchers Alexander Badaev and Maxim Shamanov said.

UnsolicitedBooker was first documented by ESET in May 2025, attributing the China-aligned threat actor to a cyber attack targeting an unnamed international organization in Saudi Arabia with a backdoor dubbed MarsSnake. The group is assessed to be active since at least March 2023 and has a history of targeting organizations in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East.

Further analysis of the threat actor has uncovered tactical overlaps with two other clusters, including Space Pirates and an as-yet-unattributed campaign targeting Saudi Arabia with another backdoor referred to as Zardoor.

The latest set of attacks documented by the Russian cybersecurity vendor was found to target Kyrgyz organizations in late September 2025 with phishing emails containing a Microsoft Office document, which, when opened, instructs recipients to "Enable Content" so as to run a malicious macro.

While the document displays a telecom provider's tariff plan to the victim, the macro stealthily drops a C++ malware loader called LuciLoad that, in turn, delivers LuciDoor. Another attack observed in late November 2025 adopted the same modus operandi, only this time it used a different loader codenamed MarsSnakeLoader to deploy MarsSnake.

As recently as January 2026, UnsolicitedBooker is said to have leveraged phishing emails as a vector to target companies in Tajikistan. While the overall attack chain remains the same, the messages embedded links to the decoy documents as opposed to directly attaching them.

Written in C++, LuciDoor establishes communication with a command-and-control (C2) server, collects basic system information, and exfiltrates the data to the server in encrypted format. It then parses the responses sent by the server to run commands using cmd.exe, write files to the system, and upload files.

MarsSnake, similarly, allows attackers to harvest system metadata, execute arbitrary commands, and read or write any file on disk.

Positive Technologies said it also found signs that MarsSnake was put to use in attacks targeting China. The starting point is a Windows shortcut that masquerades as a Microsoft Word document (*.doc.lnk) that triggers the execution of a batch script to launch a Visual Basic Script, which then launches MarsSnake without the loader component.

The decoy file is believed to be based on an LNK file associated with a publicly available pentesting tool called FTPlnk_phishing, owing to the identical LNK file creation time and Machine ID indicators. It's worth noting that a similar LNK file was put to use by the Mustang Panda group in attacks targeting Thailand in 2022.

"In their attacks, the group used rare tools of Chinese origin," Positive Technologies said. "Interestingly, at the very beginning, the group used a backdoor we dubbed LuciDoor, but later switched to the MarsSnake backdoor. However, in 2026, the group made a U-turn and resumed using LuciDoor."

"Furthermore, in at least one case, we observed the attackers using a hacked router as a C2 server, and their infrastructure mimicked that of Russia in some attacks."

PseudoSticky and Cloud Atlas Target Russia

The disclosure comes as a previously unknown threat actor is deliberately mimicking the tactics of a pro-Ukrainian hacking group called Sticky Werewolf (aka Angry Likho, MimiStick, and PhaseShifters) to attack Russian organizations in the retail, construction, and research sectors with malware like RemcosRAT and DarkTrack RAT for comprehensive data theft and remote control.

The new group, referred to as PseudoSticky, has been active since November 2025. Victims are typically infected by phishing emails containing malicious attachments that lead to the deployment of the trojans. There are indications that the threat actor has relied on large language models (LLMs) to develop attack chains that drop DarkTrack RAT via PureCrypter.

"A closer analysis reveals differences in the infrastructure, malware implementation, and individual tactical elements, leading us to suspect that there is likely no direct connection between the groups, but rather deliberate mimicry," Russian security vendor F6 said.

Russian entities have also been targeted by another hacking group called Cloud Atlas, using phishing emails bearing malicious Word documents to distribute custom malware known as VBShower and VBCloud.

"When opened, the malicious document loads a remote template from C2 specified in one of the document's streams," cybersecurity company Solar said. "This template exploits the CVE-2018-0802 vulnerability. This is followed by downloading a malicious file with alternate streams, i.e., VBShower."

[2] The Hacker News - Anthropic Says Chinese AI Firms Used 16 Million Claude Queries to Copy Model
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Tue, 24 Feb 2026 11:34:00 +0530

[TAM METİN - 666 kelime]
Anthropic on Monday said it identified "industrial-scale campaigns" mounted by three artificial intelligence (AI) companies, DeepSeek, Moonshot AI, and MiniMax, to illegally extract Claude's capabilities to improve their own models.

The distillation attacks generated over 16 million exchanges with its large language model (LLM) through about 24,000 fraudulent accounts in violation of its terms of service and regional access restrictions. All three companies are based in China, where the use of its services is prohibiteduse of its services is prohibited due to "legal, regulatory, and security risks."

Distillation refers to a technique where a less capable model is trained on the outputs generated by a stronger AI system. While distillation is a legitimate way for companies to produce smaller, cheaper versions of their own frontier models, it's illegal for competitors to leverage it to acquire such capabilities from other AI companies at a fraction of the time and cost that would take them if they were to develop them on their own.

"Illicitly distilled models lack necessary safeguards, creating significant national security risks," Anthropic said. "Models built through illicit distillation are unlikely to retain those safeguards, meaning that dangerous capabilities can proliferate with many protections stripped out entirely."

Foreign AI companies that distill American models can weaponize these unprotected capabilities to facilitate malicious activities, cyber-related or otherwise, thereby serving as a foundation for military, intelligence, and surveillance systems that authoritarian governments can deploy for offensive cyber operations, disinformation campaigns, and mass surveillance.

The campaigns detailed by AI upstart entail the use of fraudulent accounts and commercial proxy services to access Claude at scale while avoiding detection. Anthropic said it was able to attribute each campaign to a specific AI lab based on request metadata, IP address correlation, request metadata, and infrastructure indicators.

The details of the three distillation attacks are below -

DeepSeek, which targeted Claude's reasoning capabilities, rubric-based grading tasks, and sought its help in generating censorship-safe alternatives to politically sensitive queries like questions about dissidents, party leaders, or authoritarianism across over 150,000 exchanges.

Moonshot AI, which targeted Claude's agentic reasoning and tool use, coding capabilities, computer-use agent development, and computer vision across over 3.4 million exchanges.

MiniMax, which targeted Claude's agentic coding and tool use capabilities across over 13 million exchanges.

"The volume, structure, and focus of the prompts were distinct from normal usage patterns, reflecting deliberate capability extraction rather than legitimate use," Anthropic added. "Each campaign targeted Claude's most differentiated capabilities: agentic reasoning, tool use, and coding."

The company also pointed out that the attacks relied on commercial proxy services that resell access to Claude and other frontier AI models at scale. These services are powered by "hydra cluster" architectures that contain massive networks of fraudulent accounts to distribute traffic across their API.

The access is then used to generate large volumes of carefully crafted prompts that are designed to extract specific capabilities from the model for the purpose of training their own models by harvesting the high-quality responses.

"The breadth of these networks means that there are no single points of failure," Anthropic said. "When one account is banned, a new one takes its place. In one case, a single proxy network managed more than 20,000 fraudulent accounts simultaneously, mixing distillation traffic with unrelated customer requests to make detection harder."

To counter the threat, Anthropic said it has built several classifiers and behavioral fingerprinting systems to identify suspicious distillation attack patterns in API traffic, strengthened verification for educational accounts, security research programs, and startup organizations, and implemented enhanced safeguards to reduce the efficacy of model outputs for illicit distillation.

The disclosure comes weeks after Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) disclosed it identified and disrupted distillation and model extraction attacks aimed at Gemini's reasoning capabilities through more than 100,000 prompts.

"Model extraction and distillation attacks do not typically represent a risk to average users, as they do not threaten the confidentiality, availability, or integrity of AI services," Google said earlier this month. "Instead, the risk is concentrated among model developers and service providers."

[3] The Hacker News - APT28 Targeted European Entities Using Webhook-Based Macro Malware
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Tue, 24 Feb 2026 01:11:00 +0530
Link: https://thehackernews.com/2026/02/apt28-targeted-european-entities-using.html

[TAM METİN - 477 kelime]
The Russia-linked state-sponsored threat actor tracked as APT28 has been attributed to a new campaign targeting specific entities in Western and Central Europe.

The activity, per S2 Grupo's LAB52 threat intelligence team, was active between September 2025 and January 2026. It has been codenamed Operation MacroMaze. "The campaign relies on basic tooling and the exploitation of legitimate services for infrastructure and data exfiltration," the cybersecurity company said.

The attack chains employ spear-phishing emails as a starting point to distribute lure documents that contain a common structural element within their XML, a field named "INCLUDEPICTURE" that points to a webhook[.]site URL that hosts a JPG image. This, in turn, causes the image file to be fetched from the remote server when the document is opened.

Put differently, this mechanism acts as a beaconing mechanism akin to a tracking pixel that triggers an outbound HTTP request to the webhook[.]site URL upon opening the document. The server operator can log metadata associated with the request, confirming that the document was indeed opened by the recipient.

LAB52 said it identified multiple documents with slightly tweaked macros between late September 2025 and January 2026, all of which function as a dropper to establish a foothold on the compromised host and deliver additional payloads.

"While the core logic of all the macros detected remains consistent, the scripts show an evolution in evasion techniques, ranging from 'headless' browser execution in the older version to the use of keyboard simulation (SendKeys) in the newer versions to potentially bypass security prompts," the Spanish cybersecurity company explained.

The macro is designed to execute a Visual Basic Script (VBScript) to move the infection to the next stage. The script, for its part, runs a CMD file to establish persistence via scheduled tasks and launch a batch script for rendering a small Base64-encoded HTML payload in Microsoft Edge in headless mode to evade detection, retrieve a command from the webhook[.]site endpoint, execute it, capture its out, and exfiltrate it to another webhook[.]site instance in the form of an HTML file.

A second variant of the batch script has been found to eschew headless execution in favor of moving the browser window off-screen, followed by aggressively terminating all other Edge browser processes to ensure a controlled environment.

"When the resulting HTML file is rendered by Microsoft Edge, the form is submitted, causing the collected command output to be exfiltrated to the remote webhook endpoint without user interaction," LAB52 said. "This browser-based exfiltration technique leverages standard HTML functionality to transmit data while minimizing detectable artifacts on disk."

"This campaign proves that simplicity can be powerful. The attacker uses very basic tools (batch files, tiny VBS launchers and simple HTML) but arranges them with care to maximise stealth: Moving operations into hidden or off-screen browser sessions, cleaning up artifacts, and outsourcing both payload delivery and data exfiltration to widely used webhook services."

[4] The Hacker News - Wormable XMRig Campaign Uses BYOVD Exploit and Time-Based Logic Bomb
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Mon, 23 Feb 2026 23:29:00 +0530
Link: https://thehackernews.com/2026/02/wormable-xmrig-campaign-uses-byovd.html

[TAM METİN - 910 kelime]
Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed details of a new cryptojacking campaign that uses pirated software bundles as lures to deploy a bespoke XMRig miner program on compromised hosts.

"Analysis of the recovered dropper, persistence triggers, and mining payload reveals a sophisticated, multi-stage infection prioritizing maximum cryptocurrency mining hashrate, often destabilizing the victim system," Trellix researcher Aswath A said in a technical report published last week.

"Furthermore, the malware exhibits worm-like capabilities, spreading across external storage devices, enabling lateral movement even in air-gapped environments."

The entry point of the attack is the use of social engineering decoys, advertising free premium software in the form of pirated software bundles, such as installers for office productivity suites, to trick unsuspecting users into downloading malware-laced executables.

The binary acts as the central nervous system of the infection, serving different roles as an installer, watchdog, payload manager, and cleaner to oversee different aspects of the attack lifecycle. It features a modular design that separates the monitoring features from the core payloads responsible for cryptocurrency mining, privilege escalation, and persistence if it's terminated.

This flexibility, or mode switching, is achieved via command-line arguments -

No parameter, for environment validation and migration during the early installation phase.

002 Re:0, for dropping the main payloads, starting the miner, and entering a monitoring loop.

016, for restarting the miner process if it's killed.

barusu, for initiating a self-destruct sequence by terminating all malware components and deleting files.

Present within the malware is a logic bomb that operates by retrieving the local system time and comparing it against a predefined timestamp -

If it's before December 23, 2025, the malware proceeds with installing the persistence modules and launching the miner.

If it's after December 23, 2025, the binary is launched with the "barusu" argument, resulting in a "controlled decommissioning" of the infection.

The hard deadline of December 23, 2025, indicates that the campaign was designed to run indefinitely on compromised systems, with the date likely either signaling the expiration of rented command-and-control (C2) infrastructure, a predicted shift in the cryptocurrency market, or a planned move to a new malware variant, Trellix said.

In the case of the standard infection routine, the binary – which acts as a "self-contained carrier" for all malicious payloads – writes the different components to disk, including a legitimate Windows Telemetry service executable that's used to sideload the miner DLL.

Also dropped are files to ensure persistence, terminate security tools, and execute the miner with elevated privileges by using a legitimate but flawed driver ("WinRing0x64.sys") as part of a technique called bring your own vulnerable driver (BYOVD). The driver is susceptible to a vulnerability tracked as CVE-2020-14979 (CVSS score: 7.8) that allows privilege escalation.

The integration of this exploit into the XMRig miner is to have greater control over the CPU's low-level configuration and boost the mining performance (i.e., the RandomX hashrate) by 15% to 50%.

"A distinguishing feature of this XMRig variant is its aggressive propagation capability," Trellix said. "It does not rely solely on the user downloading the dropper; it actively attempts to spread to other systems via removable media. This transforms the malware from a simple Trojan into a worm."

Evidence shows that the mining activity took place, albeit sporadically, throughout November 2025, before spiking on December 8, 2025.

"This campaign serves as a potent reminder that commodity malware continues to innovate," the cybersecurity company concluded. "By chaining together social engineering, legitimate software masquerades, worm-like propagation, and kernel-level exploitation, the attackers have created a resilient and highly efficient botnet."

The disclosure comes as Darktrace said it identified a malware artifact likely generated using a large language model (LLM) that exploits the React2Shell vulnerability (CVE-2025-55182, CVSS score: 10.0) to download a Python toolkit, which leverages the access to drop an XMRig miner by running a shell command.

"While the amount of money generated by the attacker in this case is relatively low, and cryptomining is far from a new technique, this campaign is proof that AI-based LLMs have made cybercrime more accessible than ever," researchers Nathaniel Bill and Nathaniel Jones said.

"A single prompting session with a model was sufficient for this attacker to generate a functioning exploit framework and compromise more than ninety hosts, demonstrating that the operational value of AI for adversaries should not be underestimated."

Attackers have also been putting to use a toolkit dubbed ILOVEPOOP to scan for exposed systems still vulnerable to React2Shell, likely in an effort to lay the groundwork for future attacks, according to WhoisXML API. The probing activity has particularly targeted government, defense, finance, and industrial organizations in the U.S.

"What makes ILOVEPOOP unusual is a mismatch between how it was built and how it was used," said Alex Ronquillo, vice president of product at WhoisXML API. "The code itself reflects expert-level knowledge of React Server Components internals and employs attack techniques not found in any other documented React2Shell kit."

"But the people deploying it made basic operational mistakes when interacting with WhoisXML API's honeypot monitoring systems – errors that a sophisticated attacker would normally avoid. In practical terms, this gap points to a division of labor."

"We might be looking at two different groups: one that built the tool and one that's using it. We see this pattern in state-sponsored operations – a capable team develops the tooling, then hands it off to operators who run mass scanning campaigns. The operators don't need to understand how the tool works – they just need to run it."

Security news rarely moves in a straight line. This week, it feels more like a series of sharp turns, some happening quietly in the background, others playing out in public view. The details are different, but the pressure points are familiar.

Across devices, cloud services, research labs, and even everyday apps, the line between normal behavior and hidden risk keeps getting thinner. Tools meant to protect, update, or improve systems are also becoming pathways when something goes wrong.

This recap gathers the signals in one place. Quick reads, real impact, and developments that deserve a closer look before they become next week’s bigger problem.

Dell RecoverPoint for VMs Zero-Day Exploited — A maximum severity security vulnerability in Dell RecoverPoint for Virtual Machines has been exploited as a zero-day by a suspected China-nexus threat cluster dubbed UNC6201 since mid-2024. The activity involves the exploitation of CVE-2026-22769 (CVSS score: 10.0), a case of hard-coded credentials affecting versions prior to 6.0.3.1 HF1. Per Google, the hard-coded credential relates to an "admin" user for the Apache Tomcat Manager instance that could be used authenticate to the Dell RecoverPoint Tomcat Manager, upload a web shell named SLAYSTYLE via the "/manager/text/deploy" endpoint, and execute commands as root on the appliance to drop the BRICKSTORM backdoor and its newer version dubbed GRIMBOLT.

Red Report 2026: Analysis of 1.1M Malicious Files and 15.5M Actions

New research shows 80% of top ATT&CK techniques now target evasion to remain undetected. Get your copy now.

Former Google Engineers Indicted Over Alleged Trade Secret Theft — Two former Google engineers and one of their husbands have been indicted in the U.S. for allegedly committing trade secret theft from the search giant and other tech firms and transferring the information to unauthorized locations, including Iran. Samaneh Ghandali, 41, and her husband Mohammadjavad Khosravi (aka Mohammad Khosravi), 40, along with her sister Soroor Ghandali, 32, were accused of conspiring to commit trade secret theft from Google and other leading technology companies, theft and attempted theft of trade secrets, and obstruction of justice. The defendants are said to have transferred hundreds of sensitive files to a third-party communications platform and then accessed them from Iran after Samaneh Ghandali and Khosravi traveled to Iran in December 2023.

PromptSpy Android Malware Abuses Gemini for Persistence — Researchers at ESET analyzed what they described as the first Android malware to leverage generative artificial intelligence (AI) during its execution to set up persistence. Called PromptSpy, the malware uses Google Gemini to analyze the current screen and provide step-by-step instructions on how to ensure the malicious app remains pinned in the recent apps list by taking advantage of the operating system's accessibility services. There are signs that the campaign is likely targeting users in Argentina. Google told The Hacker News that it did not find any apps containing the malware being distributed via Google Play.

Kenyan Dissident's Phone Cracked Using Cellebrite's Tool — Evidence has emerged that Kenyan authorities used a commercial forensic extraction tool manufactured by Israeli company Cellebrite to break into a prominent dissident's phone. The Citizen Lab said it found the indicators on a personal phone belonging to Boniface Mwangi, a Kenyan pro-democracy activist who has announced plans to run for president in 2027. In a related development, Amnesty International found that the iPhone belonging to Teixeira Cândido, an Angolan journalist and press freedom advocate, was successfully targeted by Intellexa's Predator spyware in May 2024 after he opened an infected link received via WhatsApp.

New Pre-Installed Android Malware Keenadu Detected in the Wild — A new Android backdoor that's embedded deep into the device firmware can silently harvest data and remotely control its behavior, Kaspersky said. The malware, codenamed Keenadu, is said to have been delivered by means of compromised firmware through an over-the-air (OTA) update. This method allows it to run with high privileges from the moment the device is activated, providing attackers with extensive control over the device. It can also infect other installed apps, deploy additional software from APK files, and grant those apps any permission available on the system. Once active, Keenadu inherits elevated permissions and operates with minimal visibility. The malware triggers only under specific conditions, remaining dormant on devices set to Chinese languages or time zones and on those that lack the Google Play Store and Google Play Services. However, Keenadu's distribution is not limited to pre-installed system components. In some cases, the malware has also been observed embedded within applications distributed through Android app stores. That said, there is very little a user can do when a piece of malware comes pre-installed on their brand new Android tablet. Because the malicious components are present in firmware rather than installed later as apps, affected users may have limited ability to detect or remove them through conventional methods. The activity has not been attributed to a specific threat actor, but Kaspersky said the developers demonstrated "a deep understanding of the Android architecture, the app startup process, and the core security principles of the operating system."

Password Managers' Zero Knowledge Claims Put to Test — A new study undertaken by researchers from ETH Zurich and Università della Svizzera italiana has undermined claims from Bitwarden, Dashlane, and LastPass that the password managers guarantee "zero knowledge" -- an assurance that states there is no way for a malicious insider or a threat actor that has compromised the cloud infrastructure to access the vault data. Specifically, it found that these claims are not true under all circumstances, particularly when account recovery is in place, or password managers are set to share vaults or organize users into groups. The most severe of the attacks, targeting Bitwarden and LastPass, could allow an insider or attacker to read or write to the contents of entire vaults. Other attacks enable reading and modification of shared vaults. "Attacks on the provider server infrastructure can be prevented by carefully designed operational security measures, but it is well within the bounds of reason to assume that these services are targeted by sophisticated nation-state-level adversaries, for example via software supply-chain attacks or spear-phishing," the researchers said.

New vulnerabilities surface daily, and attackers move fast. Reviewing and patching early keeps your systems resilient.

Here are this week’s most critical flaws to check first — CVE-2026-22769 (Dell RecoverPoint for Virtual Machines), CVE-2026-25926 (Notedpad++), CVE-2026-26119 (Microsoft Windows Admin Center), CVE-2026-2329 (Grandstream GXP1600 series), CVE-2025-65717 (Live Server), CVE-2026-1358 (Airleader Master), CVE-2026-25108 (FileZen), CVE-2026-25084, CVE-2026-24789 (ZLAN), CVE-2026-2577 (Nanobot), CVE-2026-25903 (Apache NiFi), CVE-2026-26019 (@langchain/community), CVE-2026-1670 (Honeywell CCTV), CVE-2025-7740 (Hitachi Energy SuprOS), CVE-2025-61928 (better-auth), CVE-2026-20140 (Splunk Enterprise for Windows), CVE-2026-27118 (@sveltejs/adapter-vercel), CVE-2026-27099, CVE-2026-27100 (Jenkins), CVE-2026-24733 (Apache Tomcat), CVE-2026-2648, CVE-2026-2649, CVE-2026-2650 (Google Chrome), CVE-2025-29969 (Windows Fundamentals), CVE-2025-64127, CVE-2025-64128, CVE-2025-64129, CVE-2025-64130 (Zenitel), CVE-2025-32355, CVE-2025-59793 (TRUfusion Enterprise), CVE-2026-1357 (WPvivid Backup plugin), CVE-2025-9501 (W3 Total Cache plugin), CVE-2025-13818 (ESET Management Agent for Windows), CVE-2025-11730 (ZYXEL ATP/USG series), CVE-2025-67303 (ComfyUI), and Joomla! unauthenticated file read, unauthenticated file deletion, and SQL injection vulnerabilities in Novarain/Tassos Framework (no CVEs).

📰 Around the Cyber World

Online Store Infected with Skimmer — The online store of a top-10 global supermarket chain has been infected with a skimmer malware that scans for admin users for WordPress, Magento, PrestaShop, and OpenCart to evade detection. "The attack combines two components: a seemingly off-the-shelf skimmer framework with integrations for four popular e-commerce platforms, and a carefully localized fake payment form," Sansec said. "This fraud is called 'double-tap skimming': customers enter their card details into the fake form first, then see the real payment form where they have to enter their data again. Most people just accept that and complete the order, unaware their data was just stolen." The breach coincides with a broader wave of attacks targeting PrestaShop stores. In January 2026, PrestaShop urged merchants to check their stores for skimmers injected into theme template files.

Nigeria Arrests 7 for Running Scam Center — Nigerian authorities arrested seven suspects who ran a cyber scam center in the city of Agbor. The group used social media ads to lure U.K. victims to bogus crypto investment portals. Hundreds of fake Facebook accounts were potentially used to target victims. "Using these bogus social media accounts to impersonate cryptocurrency traders, they targeted people who used legitimate investment platforms, sharing false positive reviews to lure people into sending money to the fraudsters," the U.K. National Crime Agency (NCA) said. Meta said it's working with law enforcement to identify and remove all accounts used in these operations. "The group used fake social media accounts impersonating cryptocurrency traders, along with fraudulent Facebook groups featuring fabricated testimonials, to target individuals engaging with legitimate investment platforms," it added. In the first half of 2025, the company noted it took down 12 million accounts across Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp associated with criminal scam centers.

LonTalk Protocol Analyzed — Claroty has called attention to security risks posed by the LonTalk proprietary protocol that's used for device-to-device communication in building management and automation systems (BMS and BAS). "LonTalk should not be underestimated as an attack vector for hacktivists and criminal entities, especially as BMS is enabled over IP networks," the company said. "LonTalk is certainly still relevant to BMS cybersecurity discussions, especially as BMS finds its way online for a number of strategic and bottom-line reasons. Commercial real estate, retail, hospitality, and data center sectors rely on BMS systems such as HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning), lighting, energy management, and security. Previously, these systems were operated independently by facility management, but they are now increasingly connected and integrated through advanced BMS and BAS capabilities."

GrayCharlie Uses Compromised WordPress Sites to Deliver RATs — A threat actor known as GrayCharlie (aka HANEYMANEY, SmartApeSG, and ZPHP) has been observed compromising WordPress sites and injecting them with links to externally hosted JavaScript that redirects visitors to NetSupport RAT payloads delivered via fake browser update pages or ClickFix mechanisms. The threat first emerged in mid-2023. "These infections often progress to the deployment of StealC and SectopRAT," Recorded Future said. While most compromised websites appear to be opportunistic and span numerous industries, the cybersecurity company said it identified a cluster of U.S. law firm sites that were likely compromised around November 2025, likely through a supply chain attack involving a shared IT provider.

Why Patch Everything is a Recipe for Burnout — Dataminr's 2026 Cyber Threat Landscape Report has revealed that the "patching treadmill is broken," driven by reliance on CVSS scores and a surge in patch bypasses, where vendors don't address the root causes of issues, thereby opening the door to re-exploitation by threat actors days or weeks after the initial patch was released. "With thousands of CVEs disclosed every year, security teams can’t just rely on the common vulnerability severity score (CVSS) to decide what to patch," Dataminr said. "These scores focus on the technical impacts of a vulnerability, but tell you very little about actual risk to your organization. There has to be a balance between the CVSS, potential economic impact, exposure, and likelihood of being targeted. The focus has to shift from 'is this a critical CVE?' to 'is this specific flaw being targeted in my sector, and can the attacker actually reach my crown jewels through it?'"

Phishing Campaigns in Taiwan Deliver Winos 4.0 — Targeting phishing campaigns have targeted Taiwan with themes designed to exploit local business processes and ultimately deliver a known remote access trojan called Winos 4.0 (aka ValleyRAT) and malicious plugins through weaponized attachments or embedded links. "The lures mimic official communications, such as tax audit notifications, tax filing software installers, and cloud-based e-invoice downloads," Fortinet FortiGuard Labs said. "Over the past two months, we have identified various delivery techniques, including malicious LNK files used for a downloader, DLL side-loading via legitimate executables to load shellcode, and BYOVD (Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver) attacks using 'wsftprm.sys.'" The driver is used to terminate processes associated with a hard-coded list of security products. The use of Winos 4.0 is unique to a Chinese cybercrime group known as Silver Fox.

Teams Gets Brand Impersonation Protection — Microsoft said it will start rolling out Brand Impersonation Protection for Teams Calling starting mid-March 2026 to detect and warn users of suspicious external calls to reduce fraud risks. "It will be enabled by default, requires no admin action, and aims to enhance security without changing existing policies," Microsoft said. The tech giant is also planning to introduce a "Report a Call" feature by mid-March 2026 to let users flag suspicious one-to-one calls.

2025 Records 508 ICS advisories from CISA — Between March 2010 and January 31, 2026, CISA/ICS-CERT published 3,637 ICS advisories about 12,174 vulnerabilities affecting 2,783 products from 689 vendors, Forescout said. 2025 recorded a high of 508 ICS advisories, covering 2,155 vulnerabilities across various products and vendors. The development marks the first year exceeding 500 advisories. The average severity rose to a CVSS score of 8.07 and 82% of advisories were classified as high or critical. In contrast, back in 2010, the average was 6.44, and it was classified as medium severity.

Microsoft Unveils LiteBox — Microsoft has released LiteBox, a Rust-based project described as a "sandboxing library OS that drastically cuts down the interface to the host, thereby reducing attack surface." Developed in collaboration with the Linux Virtualization Based Security (LVBS) project, the goal is to sandbox applications by minimizing host system interactions and supporting various use cases like running Linux programs on Windows or sandboxing Linux applications.

ChainedShark Targets Chinese Research Sector — A new APT group codenamed ChainedShark is targeting China's academic and scientific research sector. Active since May 2024, the group's main focus has been the collection of intelligence on Chinese diplomacy and marine technology. Past victims include universities and research institutions specializing in international relations. Its arsenal integrates N-day vulnerability exploits and highly complex custom trojans such as LinkedShell. "ChainedShark exhibits clear geopolitical motivations, focusing its attacks on experts and scholars in international relations and marine sciences within Chinese academic and research institutions," NSFOCUS said. "The group demonstrates strong social engineering capabilities, crafting fluent, natural, and high-quality Chinese-language lures. It skillfully exploits professional scenarios—such as conference invitations and academic call-for-papers—to create deceptive attack vectors, effectively lowering targets' guard."

Samsung Weather App as a Way for User Fingerprinting — New research has uncovered that Samsung's pre-installed weather app is fingerprinting its users by means of a "placeid" parameter that's trivially observable by the weather API provider. A test conducted on 42 Samsung devices found that the fingerprints were unique per device and survived IP changes across providers and VPN use. "Analysis of 9,211 weather API requests from 42 Samsung device owners over five days demonstrates that placeid combinations produce unique user identifiers in 96.4% of cases," Buchodi's Threat Intel said. "Every user with two or more saved locations had a fingerprint shared by no one else in the dataset." This, in turn, turns saved locations into a persistent cross-session tracking identifier, as each placeid identifies a unique location. The fingerprint represents an aggregate of all placeid values associated with a device's saved locations. In other words, a user tracking a combination of more than two or three locations can be uniquely identified.

DDoS Attacks Jump 168% in 2025 — A new analysis released by Radware has revealed that the number of web DDoS attacks climbed 101.4% in 2025 compared to 2024, and bad bot activity increased 91.8%, fueled by generative AI tools. Malicious web application and API transactions rose 128% year over year. Network-layer DDoS attacks increased 168.2% year over year, with peak attack volumes reaching almost 30 terabits per second (Tbps). "Technology, telecommunications, and financial services were the most targeted sectors, together accounting for the majority of large-scale network DDoS campaigns," Radware said. "The technology sector alone represented 45% of all network-layer DDoS attacks, up sharply from 8.77% in 2024." Hacktivism, fueled by geopolitical and ideological conflict, remained a primary driver of DDoS activity.

Over 2,500 Malicious Images Flagged on Docker Hub — Qualys said it discovered more than 2,500 malicious images hosted on the Docker Hub. Of these, around 70% of them contained a hidden cryptominer. Others included backdoors, exploits, ransomware, keyloggers, and proxy infrastructure. "Pulling container images from public registries is no longer a neutral operational step," the company said. "It is a trust decision that directly affects infrastructure stability, cloud costs, and security risk."

Nearly 1T Scam Ads Served on Social Media in 2025 — According to new findings from Juniper Research, online tech platforms made £3.8 billion ($5.2 billion) in revenue from malicious or scam ads in Europe alone. Nearly 1 trillion scam ads were served to social media users in 2025. The analyst firm also revealed earlier this month that e-commerce fraud will rise from $56bn in 2025 to $131 billion in 2030, posting a 133% increase over the period.

Malicious npm Packages Hijack Gambling Outcomes — Researchers have discovered malicious npm packages, json-bigint-extend, jsonfx, and jsonfb, that mimic the legitimate json-bigint library, but contain functionality to install two backdoors to execute additional code fetched from an endpoint, run arbitrary SQL commands, download file contents, and list server-side files and directories. "Upon further inspection of the fetched code, it seems to be a complex cashflow-rewriting system used to manipulate a gambling game," Aikido said. "The most sophisticated component of this backdoor is the fixFlow function, a balance manipulation engine that retroactively rewrites a user's gambling history to achieve a desired balance change while maintaining the appearance of legitimate gameplay." It's suspected that the malware is designed to target a gambling app named Bappa Rummy. It's no longer listed on the official Google Play Store.

Telegram Disputes Claims About Encryption — The head of Russia's FSB security service accused Telegram of harboring criminal activity and failing to act on reports from Russian authorities. Bortnikov said Telegram ignored more than 150,000 requests for removal from Russian authorities. Russian officials also claimed that foreign intelligence services could read messages sent by Russian soldiers over the app. The messaging platform said "no breaches of Telegram's encryption have ever been found." The development comes as Russia started blocking and throttling Telegram traffic last week.

Nigerian Man Sentenced to Eight Years in Prison for Bogus Tax Refund Scheme — A 37-year-old Nigerian man named Matthew A. Akande, who was living in Mexico, was sentenced to eight years in prison in the U.S. for his involvement in a criminal operation that involved unauthorized access to the computer networks of tax preparation firms in Massachusetts. Between in or about June 2016 and June 2021, Akande conspired to use stolen taxpayer information to file over 1,000 fraudulent tax returns seeking millions of dollars in tax refunds, the Justice Department said. The defendant was also ordered to pay $1,393,230 in restitution. He was arrested in October 2024 in the U.K. and extradited to the U.S. in March 2025. "To carry out the scheme, Akande caused fraudulent phishing emails to be sent to five Massachusetts tax preparation firms," the department said. The emails purported to be from a prospective client seeking the tax preparation firms’ services, but in truth were used to trick the firms into downloading remote access trojan malicious software (RAT malware), including malware known as Warzone RAT. Akande used the RAT malware to obtain the PII and prior year tax information of the tax preparation firms' clients, which Akande then used to cause fraudulent tax returns to be filed seeking refunds." Warzone RAT's infrastructure was seized by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation in February 2024.

New Campaigns Distribute njRAT, Pulsar RAT, XWorm, and Prometei — In a new campaign, threat actors are leveraging the njRAT remote access trojan to deliver the MassLogger infostealer. Another campaign has been found to use a Donut loader to distribute Pulsar RAT as part of a sophisticated, multi-stage malware attack. What's notable about this activity is that Pulsar RAT is used to actively control a compromised host, allowing an attacker to initiate a real-time chat session with the victim to interact and probe system usage. Also discovered are two campaigns using phishing emails to distribute XWorm: One uses a JavaScript dropper to target Brazilian users, and another begins with phishing emails delivering a malicious Excel attachment to targeted users. The Excel file exploits CVE-2018-0802, a memory corruption flaw in Office patched in 2018, to download and execute an HTA file on the victim's device, which, in turn, triggers PowerShell to download and run a fileless .NET module directly into memory. The module then uses process hollowing to inject and execute the XWorm payload within a newly created MSBuild.exe process. Last but not least, Windows servers are being targeted by threat actors to infect them with a botnet known as Prometei. "It features extensive capabilities, including remote control functionality, credential harvesting, crypto-mining (Monero), lateral movement, command-and-control (C2) over both the clearweb and TOR network, and self-preservation measures that harden compromised systems against other threat actors, to maintain exclusive access," eSentire said.

🔧 Cybersecurity Tools

Gixy Next → It is an open-source security analysis tool designed to audit NGINX configurations for common misconfigurations and vulnerabilities. It scans configuration files to detect issues such as unsafe directives, incorrect access controls, and insecure proxy settings that could expose applications to attacks. Built as a successor to the original Gixy project, it aims to provide updated checks and improved rule coverage for modern NGINX deployments.

The-One-WSL-BOF → It is an open-source Cobalt Strike Beacon Object File that lets operators interact with Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) directly from a Beacon session. It can list WSL distributions and run commands inside them without launching wsl.exe, reducing visible process activity and some logging artifacts.

[6] The Hacker News - How Exposed Endpoints Increase Risk Across LLM Infrastructure
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Mon, 23 Feb 2026 17:28:00 +0530
Link: https://thehackernews.com/2026/02/how-exposed-endpoints-increase-risk.html

[TAM METİN - 1388 kelime]
As more organizations run their own Large Language Models (LLMs), they are also deploying more internal services and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to support those models. Modern security risks are being introduced less from the models themselves and more from the infrastructure that serves, connects and automates the model. Each new LLM endpoint expands the attack surface, often in ways that are easy to overlook during rapid deployment, especially when endpoints are trusted implicitly. When LLM endpoints accumulate excessive permissions and long-lived credentials are exposed, they can provide far more access than intended. Organizations must prioritize endpoint privilege management because exposed endpoints have become an increasingly common attack vector for cybercriminals to access the systems, identities and secrets that power LLM workloads.

What is an endpoint in modern LLM infrastructure?

In modern LLM infrastructure, an endpoint is any interface where something — whether it be a user, application or service — can communicate with a model. Simply put, endpoints allow requests to be sent to an LLM and for responses to be returned. Common examples include inference APIs that handle prompts and generate outputs, model management interfaces used to update models and administrative dashboards that allow teams to monitor performance. Many LLM deployments also rely on plugin or tool execution endpoints, which allow models to interact with external services such as databases that may connect the LLM to other systems. Together, these endpoints define how the LLM connects to the rest of its environment.

The main challenge is that most LLM endpoints are built for internal use and speed, not long-term security. They are typically created to support experimentation or early deployments and then are left running with minimal oversight. As a result, they tend to be poorly monitored and granted more access than necessary. In practice, the endpoint becomes the security boundary, meaning its identity controls, secrets handling and privilege scope determine how far a cybercriminal can go.

How LLM endpoints become exposed

LLMs are rarely exposed through one failure; more often, exposure happens gradually through small assumptions and decisions made during development and deployment. Over time, these patterns transform internal services into externally reachable attack surfaces. Some of the most common exposure patterns include:

Publicly accessible APIs without authentication: Internal APIs are sometimes exposed publicly to quicken testing or integration. Authentication is delayed or skipped entirely, and the endpoint remains accessible long after it was meant to be restricted.

Weak or static tokens: Many LLM endpoints rely on tokens or API keys that are hardcoded and never rotated. If these secrets are leaked through misconfigured systems or repositories, unauthorized users can access an endpoint indefinitely.

The assumption that internal means safe: Teams often treat internal endpoints as trusted by default, assuming they will never be reached by unauthorized users. However, internal networks are frequently reachable through VPNs or misconfigured controls.

Temporary test endpoints that become permanent: Endpoints designed for debugging or demos are rarely cleaned up. Over time, these endpoints remain active but unmonitored and poorly secured while the surrounding infrastructure evolves.

Cloud misconfigurations that expose services: Misconfigured API gateways or firewall rules can unintentionally expose internal LLM endpoints to the internet. These misconfigurations often occur gradually and go unnoticed until the endpoint is already exposed.

Why exposed endpoints are dangerous across LLM infrastructure

Exposed endpoints are particularly dangerous in LLM environments because LLMs are designed to connect multiple systems within a broader technical infrastructure. When cybercriminals compromise a single LLM endpoint, they can often gain access to much more than the model itself. Unlike traditional APIs that perform one function, LLM endpoints are commonly integrated with databases, internal tools or cloud services to support automated workflows. Therefore, one compromised endpoint can allow cybercriminals to move quickly and laterally across systems that already trust the LLM by default.

The real danger doesn’t derive from the LLM being too powerful but rather from the implicit trust placed in the endpoint from the beginning. Once an LLM endpoint is exposed, it can act as a force multiplier; cybercriminals can use a compromised endpoint for various automated tasks instead of manually exploring systems. Exposed endpoints can jeopardize LLM environments through:

Prompt-driven data exfiltration: Cybercriminals can create prompts that cause the LLM to summarize sensitive data it has access to, turning the model into an automated data extraction tool.

Abuse of tool-calling permissions: When LLMs call internal tools or services, exposed endpoints can be used to abuse these tools by modifying resources or performing privileged actions.

Indirect prompt injection: Even when access is limited, cybercriminals can manipulate data sources or LLM inputs, causing the model to execute harmful actions indirectly.

Why NHIs are especially dangerous in LLM environments

Non-Human Identities (NHIs) are credentials used by systems instead of human users. In LLM environments, service accounts, API keys and other non-human credentials enable models to access data, interact with cloud services and perform automated tasks. NHIs pose a significant security risk in LLM environments because models rely on them continuously. Out of convenience, teams often grant NHIs broad permissions but fail to revisit and tighten access controls later. When an LLM endpoint is compromised, cybercriminals inherit the NHI’s access behind that endpoint, allowing them to operate using trusted credentials. Several common problems worsen this security risk:

Secrets sprawl: API keys and service account credentials are often spread across configuration files and pipelines, making them difficult to track and secure.

Static credentials: Many NHIs use long-lived credentials that are rarely, if ever, rotated. Once those credentials are exposed, they remain usable for long periods of time.

Excessive permissions: Broad access is often granted to NHIs to avoid delays, but it’s inevitably forgotten about. Over time, NHIs accumulate permissions beyond what is actually necessary for their tasks.

Identity sprawl: Growing LLM systems produce large numbers of NHIs across environments. Without proper oversight and management, this expansion of identities reduces visibility and increases the attack surface.

How to reduce risk from exposed endpoints

Reducing risk from exposed endpoints starts with assuming that cybercriminals will eventually reach exposed services. Security teams should aim not just to prevent access but to limit what can happen once an endpoint is reached. An easy way to do this is by applying zero-trust security principles to all endpoints: access should be explicitly verified, continuously evaluated and tightly monitored in all cases. Security teams should also do the following:

Enforce least-privilege access for human and machine users: Endpoints should only have access to what is necessary to perform a specific task, regardless of whether the user is human or non-human. Reducing permissions limits how much damage a cybercriminal can do with a compromised endpoint.

Use Just-in-Time (JIT) access: Privileged access should not be available all the time on any endpoint. With JIT access, privileges are only granted when necessary and automatically revoked after a task is completed.

Monitor and record privileged sessions: Monitoring and recording privileged activity helps security teams detect privilege misuse, investigate security incidents and understand how endpoints are actually being used.

Rotate secrets automatically: Tokens, API keys and service account credentials must be rotated on a regular basis. Automated secrets rotation reduces the risk of long-term credential abuse if secrets are exposed.

Remove long-lived credentials when possible: Static credentials are one of the biggest security risks in LLM environments. Replacing them with short-lived credentials limits how long compromised secrets remain useful in the wrong hands.

These security measures are especially important in LLM environments because LLMs rely heavily on automation. Since models operate continuously without human oversight, organizations must protect access by keeping it time-limited and closely monitored.

Prioritize endpoint privilege management to enhance security

Exposed endpoints amplify risk quickly in LLM environments, where models are deeply integrated with internal tools and sensitive data. Traditional access models are insufficient for systems that act autonomously and at scale, which is why organizations must rethink how they grant and manage access in AI infrastructure. Endpoint privilege management shifts the focus from trying to prevent breaches on endpoints to limiting the impact by eliminating standing access and controlling what both human and non-human users can do after an endpoint is reached. Solutions like Keeper support this zero-trust security model by helping organizations remove unnecessary access and better protect critical LLM systems.

[7] The Hacker News - Malicious npm Packages Harvest Crypto Keys, CI Secrets, and API Tokens
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Mon, 23 Feb 2026 15:50:00 +0530
Link: https://thehackernews.com/2026/02/malicious-npm-packages-harvest-crypto.html

[TAM METİN - 856 kelime]
Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed what they say is an active "Shai-Hulud-like" supply chain worm campaign that has leveraged a cluster of at least 19 malicious npm packages to enable credential harvesting and cryptocurrency key theft.

The campaign has been codenamed SANDWORM_MODE by supply chain security company Socket. As with prior Shai-Hulud attack waves, the malicious code embedded into the packages comes with capabilities to siphon system information, access tokens, environment secrets, and API keys from developer environments and automatically propagate by abusing stolen npm and GitHub identities to extend its reach.

"The sample retains Shai-Hulud hallmarks and adds GitHub API exfiltration with DNS fallback, hook-based persistence, SSH propagation fallback, MCP server injection with embedded prompt injection targeting AI coding assistants, and LLM API Key harvesting," the company said.

The packages, published to npm by two npm publisher aliases, official334 and javaorg, are listed below -

crypto-reader-info@1.0.0

format-defaults@1.0.0

locale-loader-pro@1.0.0

node-native-bridge@1.0.0

Also identified are four sleeper packages that do not incorporate any malicious features -

The packages go beyond npm-based propagation by including a weaponized GitHub Action that harvests CI/CD secrets and exfiltrates them via HTTPS with DNS fallback. They also feature a destructive routine that acts as a kill switch by triggering home directory wiping should it lose access to GitHub and npm. The wiper functionality is currently off by default.

Another significant component of the malware is an "McpInject" module that specifically targets AI coding assistants by deploying a malicious model context protocol (MCP) server and injecting it into their tool configurations. The MCP server masquerades as a legitimate tool provider and registers three seemingly-harmless tools, each of which embeds a prompt injection to read the contents of ~/.ssh/id_rsa, ~/.ssh/id_ed25519, ~/.aws/credentials, ~/.npmrc, and .env files, stage them in a local directory for later exfiltration.

The module targets Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor, Microsoft Visual Studio Code (VS Code) Continue, and Windsurf. It also harvests API keys for nine large language models (LLM) providers: Anthropic, Cohere, Fireworks AI, Google, Grok, Mistral, OpenAI, Replicate, and Together.

What's more, the payload contains a polymorphic engine that's configured to call a local Ollama instance with the DeepSeek Coder model to rename variables, rewrite control flow, insert junk code, and encode strings to evade detection. While the engine is turned off in the currently detected packages, the inclusion of the feature suggests that the operators are looking to release more iterations of the malware in the future.

The entire attack chain unfolds over two stages: a first-stage component that captures credentials and cryptocurrency keys and then loads a secondary stage that subsequently performs deeper harvesting of credentials from password managers, worm-like propagation, MCP injection, and full exfiltration. The second stage is not activated until 48 hours (along with a per-machine jitter of up to 48 additional hours) have elapsed.

Users who have installed any of the aforementioned packages are advised to remove them with immediate effect, rotate npm/GitHub tokens and CI secrets, and review any package.json, lockfiles, and .github/workflows/ for any unexpected changes.

"Several feature flags and guardrails still suggest the threat actor is iterating on capabilities (for example, toggles that disable destructive routines or polymorphic rewriting in some builds)," Socket said. "However, the same worm code appearing across multiple typosquatting packages and publisher aliases indicates intentional distribution rather than an accidental release."

"The destructive and propagation behaviors remain real and high-risk, and defenders should treat these packages as active compromise risks rather than benign test artifacts."

The disclosure comes as Veracode and JFrog detailed two other malicious npm packages named "buildrunner-dev" and "eslint-verify-plugin," respectively, that are designed to deliver a remote access trojan (RAT) targeting Windows, macOS, and Linux systems. The .NET malware deployed by buildrunner-dev is Pulsar RAT, an open-source RAT delivered via a PNG image hosted on i.ibb[.]co.

Eslint-verify-plugin, on the other hand, "masquerades as a legitimate ESLint utility while deploying a sophisticated, multi-stage infection chain targeting macOS and Linux environments," JFrog said.

On Linux, the package deploys a Poseidon agent for the Mythic C2 framework. It facilitates a wide range of post-exploitation capabilities, including file operations, credential harvesting, and lateral movement. The macOS infection sequence executes Apfell, a JavaScript for Automation (JXA) agent for macOS, to conduct extensive data collection and create a new macOS user with admin privileges.

Some of the data stolen by the agent are as follows -

System credentials via a fake password dialog

Google Chrome browser bookmarks

"The eslint-verify-plugin package is a direct example of how a malicious npm package can escalate from a simple installation hook to a full-system compromise," JFrog said. "By masquerading as a legitimate utility, the attackers successfully concealed a multi-stage infection chain."

The findings also follow a report from Checkmarx, which flagged a rogue VS Code extension known as "solid281" that impersonates the official Solidity extension, but harbors covert features to execute a heavily obfuscated loader automatically upon application startup and drop ScreenConnect on Windows and a Python reverse shell on macOS and Linux machines.

"This mirrors broader patterns reported by other teams: Solidity developers appear to be targeted specifically, including campaigns that used fake Solidity extensions to install ScreenConnect and then deploy follow-on payloads," Checkmarx noted.

[8] The Hacker News - MuddyWater Targets MENA Organizations with GhostFetch, CHAR, and HTTP_VIP
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[TAM METİN - 613 kelime]
The Iranian hacking group known as MuddyWater (aka Earth Vetala, Mango Sandstorm, and MUDDYCOAST) has targeted several organizations and individuals mainly located across the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region as part of a new campaign codenamed Operation Olalampo.

The activity, first observed on January 26, 2026, has resulted in the deployment of new malware families that share overlapping samples previously identified as used by the threat actor, according to a report published by Group-IB. These include downloaders like GhostFetch and HTTP_VIP, along with a Rust backdoor called CHAR and an advanced implant codenamed GhostBackDoor that's dropped by GhostFetch.

"These attacks follow similar patterns and align with the killchains previously observed in MuddyWater attacks; starting with a phishing email with a Microsoft Office document attached to it that contains malicious macro code that decodes the embedded payload and drops it on the system and executes it, providing the adversary with remote control of the system," the company said.

One such attack chain employing a malicious Microsoft Excel document prompts users to enable macros in order to activate the infection and ultimately drop CHAR. Another variant of the same attack has been found to lead to the deployment of the GhostFetch downloader, which then downloads GhostBackDoor.

A third version of the attack leverages themes such as flight tickets and reports, in contrast to using lures mimicking an energy and marine services company in the Middle East, to distribute the HTTP_VIP downloader that subsequently deploys the AnyDesk remote desktop software.

A brief description of the four tools is as follows -

GhostFetch, a first-stage downloader that profiles the system, validates mouse movements and checks screen resolution, checks for the presence of debuggers, virtual machine artifacts, and antivirus software, and fetches and executes secondary payloads directly in memory.

GhostBackDoor, a second-stage backdoor delivered by GhostFetch that supports an interactive shell, file read/write, and re-run GhostFetch.

HTTP_VIP, a native downloader that conducts system reconnaissance, connects to an external server ("codefusiontech[.]org") to authenticate and deploy AnyDesk from the C2 server. A new variant of the malware also adds the ability to retrieve victim information and retrieve instructions to start an interactive shell, download/upload files, capture clipboard contents, and update the sleep/beaconing interval.

CHAR, a Rust backdoor that's controlled by a Telegram bot (whose first name is "Olalampo" and username is "stager_51_bot") to change directory and execute a cmd.exe or PowerShell command.

The PowerShell command is designed to execute a SOCKS5 reverse proxy or another backdoor named Kalim, upload data stolen from web browsers, and run unknown executables referred to as "sh.exe" and "gshdoc_release_X64_GUI.exe."

Group-IB's analysis of CHAR's source code has revealed signs of artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted development owing to the presence of emojis in debug strings, a finding that's consistent with Google's revelations last year that the threat actor is experimenting with generative AI tools to facilitate the development of custom malware to support file transfer and remote execution.

Another notable aspect is that CHAR shares a similar structure and development environment as the Rust-based malware BlackBeard (aka Archer RAT and RUSTRIC), which was flagged by CloudSEK and Seqrite Labs as put to use by the threat actor to target various entities in the Middle East.

MuddyWater has also been observed exploiting recently disclosed vulnerabilities on public-facing servers as a way to obtain initial access to target networks.

"The MuddyWater APT group remains an active threat within the META [Middle East, Turkey, and Africa] region, with this operation primarily targeting organizations in the MENA region," Group-IB concluded. "The group's continued adoption of AI technology, combined with continued development of custom malware and tooling and diversified command-and-control (C2) infrastructures, underscores their dedication and intent to expand their operations."

[9] BleepingComputer - North Korean Lazarus group linked to Medusa ransomware attacks
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Tue, 24 Feb 2026 06:00:00 -0500

[TAM METİN - 464 kelime]
North Korean state-backed hackers associated with the Lazarus threat group are targeting U.S. healthcare organizations in extortion attacks using the Medusa ransomware.

The Medusa ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operation emerged in January 2021, and by February 2025, it impacted over 300 organizations in various critical infrastructure sectors. Since then, the gang claimed at least another 80 victims.

North Korean threat actors have previously been linked to other ransomware strains such as HolyGhost, PLAY, Maui, Qilin, as well as other malware families. However, this is the first time security researchers have associated the actor with Medusa.

In a report today, enterprise cybersecurity company Symantec says that a Lazarus subgroup, possibly Andariel/Stonefly, is now using Medusa in financially-motivated cyberattacks targeting U.S. healthcare providers.

According to the researchers, the toolset used in these attacks also shows some association with Diamond Sleet, another North Korean group that typically targets media, defense, and IT industries.

However, some of the utilities seen in the Medusa ransomware attacks are commodity tools:

Comebacker – Diamond Sleet-linked backdoor/loader (seen used by Diamond Sleet)

Blindingcan – Remote access trojan

ChromeStealer – Chrome credential extractor

Infohook – Information stealer

Mimikatz – Credential dumping tool

RP_Proxy – Custom proxy tool

Curl – Data transfer tool

The researchers comment that no sectors are off-limits for North Korean hackers, who keep getting involved in cybercrime for financial gain.

“While some cybercrime outfits claim to steer clear of targeting healthcare organizations due to the reputational damage it may attract, Lazaurs doesn’t seem to be in any way constrained,” Symantec researchers say.

Medusa targeted multiple healthcare and non-profit organizations in the U.S., as the gang's data leak site lists four such victims since the beginning of November 2025, among them an educational facility for autistic children.

Not all these Medusa attacks can be confidently attributed to Lazarus hackers, though. Medusa can demand ransoms as large as $15 million, but Symantec researchers say that the average is around $260,000.

Stolen funds are used to support espionage operations against entities in the defense, technology, and government sectors in the U.S., Taiwan, and South Korea.

Symantec has provided a set of indicators of compromise (IoCs) in its report, which include network infrastructure data and hashes for the malware used in attacks.

[10] BleepingComputer - Android mental health apps with 14.7M installs filled with security flaws

[TAM METİN - 683 kelime]
Several mental health mobile apps with millions of downloads on Google Play contain security vulnerabilities that could expose users’ sensitive medical information.

In one of the apps, security researchers discovered more than 85 medium- and high-severity vulnerabilities that could be exploited to compromise users’ therapy data and privacy.

Some of the products are AI companions designed to help people suffering from clinical depression, multiple forms of anxiety, panic attacks, stress, and bipolar disorder.

At least six of the ten analyzed apps state that user conversations or chats remain private, or are encrypted securely on the vendor’s servers.

“Mental health data carries unique risks. On the dark web, therapy records sell for $1,000 or more per record, far more than credit card numbers,” says Sergey Toshin, founder of mobile security company Oversecured.

Over 1,500 security issues found

Oversecured scanned ten mobile apps advertised as tools that can help with various mental health problems, and uncovered a total of 1,575 security vulnerabilities (54 rated high-severity, 538 medium-severity, and 983 low-severity).

Although none of the discovered issues are critical, many can be leveraged to intercept login credentials, spoof notifications, HTML injection, or to locate the user.

The researchers used the Oversecured scanner to check the APK files of the ten mental health applications for known vulnerability patterns in dozens of categories.

In a report shared with BleepingComputer, the researchers say that some of the verified apps “parse user-supplied URIs without adequate validation.”

One therapy app with more than one million downloads uses Intent.parseUri() on an externally controlled string and launches the resulting messaging object (intent) without validating the target component.

This allows an attacker to force the app to open any internal activity, even if it is not intended for external access.

“Since these internal activities often handle authentication tokens and session data, exploitation could give an attacker access to a user’s therapy records,” Oversecured explains.

Another issue is storing data locally in a way that gives read access to any app on the device. Depending on the saved information, this could expose therapy details, such as therapy entries, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) session notes, and various scores.

Oversecured states that they also discovered plaintext configuration data, including backend API endpoints and a hardcoded Firebase database URL, within the APK resources.

Furthermore, some of the vulnerable apps use the cryptographically insecure java.util.Random class for generating session tokens or encryption keys.

According to the researchers, “most of the 10 apps lack any form of root detection.” On a rooted (jailbroken) device, any app with root privileges has access to all health data stored locally.

Oversecured says that six of the ten analyzed apps “had zero high-severity findings, but still carried medium-severity issues that weaken their overall security posture.”

“These apps collect and store some of the most sensitive personal data in mobile: therapy session transcripts, mood logs, medication schedules, self-harm indicators, and in some cases, information protected under HIPAA,” the researchers note.

From BleepingComputer’s observations the collective download count for the apps scanned by Oversecured is more than 14.7 million, and only four received an update as recently as this month. For the rest, the date of the latest update was as recent as November 2025 or even September 2024.

Oversecured’s scans occurred between January 22 and 23 and targeted the latest app versions available at the time. The researchers cannot confirm if any of the uncovered vulnerabilities have been addressed.

BleepingComputer has refrained from the sharing the names of the impacted apps as the vulnerabilities are still being disclosed by Oversecured.

Spanish authorities have arrested four alleged members of a hacktivist group believed to have carried out cyberattacks targeting government ministries, political parties, and various public institutions.

The group, which called itself "Anonymous Fénix" and claimed they were affiliated with the Anonymous hacker collective, conducted distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against targets in Spain and several South American countries, according to the Spanish Civil Guard.

The first attacks occurred in April 2023 and peaked after the flash floods that struck Valencia in late October 2024, when the group's members attacked multiple government websites, claiming Spanish authorities were responsible for the deaths and destruction caused by the storm.

Anonymous Fénix also used X and Telegram to spread anti-government messaging and recruit volunteers for its campaigns.

"From September 2024 they increased their activity and initiated a campaign of recruitment of volunteers with the aim of perpetrating cyberattacks against relevant domains," the Spanish Civil Guard said over the weekend.

"They reached their peak after the DANA of Valencia when they managed to successfully attack different websites of the Public Administration, justifying that they were 'the responsible for the tragedy.'"

The Civil Guard arrested the group's administrator and moderator in May 2025, in Alcalá de Henares, near Madrid, and Oviedo, in the northern region of Asturias. After analyzing the evidence collected following those arrests, investigators identified two additional members of the group as its most active operatives, who were arrested earlier this month in Ibiza and Móstoles, near Madrid.

Following the arrests, Spanish courts also ordered the seizure of the group's accounts on X and YouTube and ordered the closure of its Telegram channel. No details on specific charges or potential penalties were provided in the Civil Guard's announcement.

In recent months, Spanish authorities also detained a 19-year-old suspect in Barcelona for allegedly breaching nine companies and dismantled the "GXC Team" crime-as-a-service (CaaS) platform that pushed AI-powered phishing kits, Android malware, and voice-scam tools.

More recently, in January, the Spanish National Police arrested 34 suspects linked to a criminal network involved in cyber fraud and believed to be connected to the Black Axe crime ring.

[12] BleepingComputer - Microsoft says bug in classic Outlook hides the mouse pointer
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Mon, 23 Feb 2026 14:40:42 -0500

[TAM METİN - 451 kelime]
Microsoft is investigating a known issue that causes the mouse pointer to disappear in the classic Outlook desktop email client for some users.

This bug has been acknowledged almost two months after the first reports started surfacing online, with users saying that Outlook became unusable after the mouse pointer vanished while using the app.

"My mouse just stopped being visible while I am using Outlook, and this is very, very, frustrating because my permission wasn't given to make these changes, and now I can't find anything, can't open emails, can't copy and paste, and the list goes on and on," one customer noted.

Microsoft explained in a recent support document that the mouse pointer (and in some cases the cursor) will suddenly vanish as users move it across Outlook's interface, and noted that this bug also affects some users of other Microsoft 365 apps.

"When using classic Outlook, you may find that the mouse pointer or mouse cursor disappears as you move the pointer over the Outlook interface," it said. "Although the mouse pointer is not there, the email in the message list will change color as you hover over it. This issue has also been reported with OneNote and other Microsoft 365 apps to a lesser degree."

Microsoft added that the Outlook team is investigating the issues and will provide updates as more information becomes available. In the meantime, Microsoft is asking affected users to have their Microsoft 365 administrator open a support case with the Outlook Support Team and submit diagnostic log files to assist with analysis.

While a timeline for a permanent fix is not yet available, Microsoft has offered three temporary workarounds that require affected users to click an email in the message list when the cursor disappears, which may cause it to reappear.

Alternatively, switching to PowerPoint, clicking into an editable area, and then returning to Outlook may also restore the mouse pointer. If neither of them works, Microsoft said that restarting the computer should resolve the issue temporarily.

Last month, Microsoft fixed another classic Outlook issue that prevented Microsoft 365 customers from opening encrypted emails after installing the December 2025 updates.

[13] BleepingComputer - Ad tech firm Optimizely confirms data breach after vishing attack
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Mon, 23 Feb 2026 13:04:01 -0500

[TAM METİN - 586 kelime]
New York-based ad tech company Optimizely has notified an undisclosed number of customers of a data breach after threat actors compromised some of its systems in a voice phishing attack.

Optimizely has nearly 1,500 employees across 21 global offices, and its customer list includes over 10,000 businesses, including high-profile brands like H&M, PayPal, Zoom, Toyota, Vodafone, Shell, Salesforce, and Nike.

In breach notification letters sent to affected customers, the company, the threat actors reached out on February 11, claiming they had access to its systems.

Optimizely also told BleepingComputer that the attackers breached some of its systems and stole what it described as "basic business contact information."

"The threat actor gained access to Optimizely's systems through a sophisticated voice-phishing attack, but was unable to escalate privileges, install software, or create any backdoors in the Optimizely environment, and we have no evidence that the threat actor was able to access sensitive customer data or personal information beyond basic business contact information," it said.

Optimizely also noted the "incident was confined to certain internal business systems, records in our CRM, and a limited set of internal documents used for back-office operations," and added that its "business operations continue without disruption."

The company also warned customers to be wary of attacks that could use some of the stolen data in further phishing attempts, which may use calls, texts, or emails to ask for passwords, MFA codes, or other credentials.

While Optimizely didn't share how many customers had their information exposed in the data breach and has yet to name the threat actor behind the attack, it told affected customers that "the communication we received is consistent with the behavior of a loosely affiliated group who use sophisticated and aggressive social engineering tactics, most often involving voice phishing, to attempt to access their victims systems."

This hints that the attackers are likely part of the ShinyHunters extortion operation, which has claimed similar breaches at Canada Goose, Panera Bread, Betterment, SoundCloud, PornHub, fintech firm Figure, and online dating giant Match Group (which owns multiple popular dating services, including Tinder, Hinge, Meetic, Match.com, and OkCupid) in recent weeks.

While not all of these breaches are part of the same campaign, some victims had their systems compromised in a voice phishing (vishing) campaign targeting single sign-on (SSO) accounts at Microsoft, Okta, and Google across over 100 high-profile organizations.

In these attacks, threat actors impersonate targets' IT support, call employees, and trick them into entering credentials and multi-factor authentication (MFA) codes on phishing sites mimicking their companies' login portals.

As BleepingComputer first reported, the threat actors have also recently altered their social engineering attacks to use device code vishing, abusing the legitimate OAuth 2.0 device authorization grant flow to obtain Microsoft Entra authentication tokens.

Once in, they hijack the victim's SSO account and gain access to connected enterprise services, including Salesforce, Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, Zendesk, Dropbox, SAP, Slack, Adobe, Atlassian, and many others.

[14] BleepingComputer - When identity isn’t the weak link, access still is
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Mon, 23 Feb 2026 10:00:10 -0500
Link: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/when-identity-isnt-the-weak-link-access-still-is/

[TAM METİN - 880 kelime]
For years, identity has been treated as the foundation of workforce security. If an organization could reliably confirm who a user was, the assumption followed that access could be granted with confidence.

That logic worked when employees accessed corporate networks from corporate devices under predictable conditions. Today, that no longer reflects how access is actually used or abused.

The modern workforce operates across multiple locations, networks, and time zones. Employees routinely switch between corporate laptops, personal devices, and third-party endpoints.

Access is no longer anchored to a single environment or device, yet security teams are expected to support this flexibility without increasing exposure or disrupting productivity, even as the signals used to make access decisions become noisier, more fragmented, and harder to trust on their own.

As a result, identity is being asked to carry responsibility it was never designed to hold alone. Authentication can confirm who a user claims to be, but it does not provide sufficient insight into how risky that access may be once device condition and context are taken into account. In modern environments, the core issue is not identity failure, but the over-reliance on identity as a proxy for trust.

Identity tells us who, not how risky the access is

A legitimate user accessing systems from a secure, compliant device represents a fundamentally different risk from the same user connecting from an outdated, unmanaged, or compromised endpoint. Yet many access models continue to treat these scenarios as equivalent, granting access primarily on identity while device condition remains secondary or static.

This approach fails to account for how quickly device risk changes after authentication. Endpoints regularly shift state as configurations drift, security controls are disabled, or updates are delayed, often long after access has already been granted.

When access decisions remain tied to the conditions present at login, trust persists even as the underlying risk profile degrades.

These gaps are most visible across access paths that fall outside modern conditional access coverage, including legacy protocols, remote access tools, and non-browser-based workflows. In these cases, access decisions are often made with limited context, and trust is extended beyond the point where it is justified.

Attackers are increasingly exploiting these blind spots by reusing misplaced trust rather than breaking authentication, stealing session tokens, abusing compromised endpoints, or working around multi-factor authentication.

After all, it’s easier to log in than break in. A valid identity presented from the wrong device remains one of the most reliable ways to bypass modern controls and fly under the radar.

Verizon’s Data Breach Investigation Report found stolen credentials are involved in 44.7% of breaches. 
 
Effortlessly secure Active Directory with compliant password policies, blocking 4+ billion compromised passwords, boosting security, and slashing support hassles!

Why Zero Trust often falls short

Zero Trust is widely accepted as a security principle, but far less consistently applied across workforce access. While identity controls have matured, progress frequently stalls at the device layer, particularly across access paths outside browser-based or modern conditional access frameworks that inherit trust by default.

Establishing device trust introduces complexity that identity alone cannot address. Unmanaged and personal devices are difficult to assess consistently, compliance checks are often static rather than continuous, and enforcement varies depending on how access is initiated.

These challenges are compounded when identity and endpoint signals are handled by separate tools that were never designed to work together. The result is fragmented visibility and inconsistent decisions.

Over time, access policies can harden and become static, creating more opportunities for identity abuse. When access is granted without ongoing checks, traditional controls are slow to detect and respond to malicious behavior.

From identity checks to continuous access verification

Addressing static, identity-centric access controls requires mechanisms that remain effective after authentication and adapt as conditions change.

Solutions such as Infinipoint operationalize this model by extending trust decisions beyond identity and maintaining enforcement as conditions evolve.

The following measures focus on closing the most common access failure points without disrupting how people work.

Verify both user and device continuously: This approach reduces the effectiveness of stolen credentials, session tokens, and multi-factor authentication bypass techniques by ensuring access is tied to a trusted endpoint rather than granted on identity alone.

Apply device-based access controls: Device-based access controls make it possible to enroll approved hardware, limit the number and type of devices per user, and differentiate between corporate, personal, and third-party endpoints. This prevents attackers from reusing valid credentials from untrusted devices.

Enforce security without defaulting to disruption: Proportionate enforcement allows organizations to respond to risk without unnecessarily interrupting legitimate work. This includes conditional restrictions and grace periods that give users time to resolve issues while maintaining security controls.

Enable self-service remediation to restore trust: Self-guided, one-click remediation for actions such as enabling encryption or updating operating systems allows trust to be restored efficiently, reducing support tickets and demand on IT teams while keeping security standards intact.

Specops, the Identity and Access Management division of Outpost24, delivers these controls through Infinipoint, enabling zero trust workforce access that verifies both users and devices at every access point and continuously throughout each session across Windows, macOS, Linux, and mobile platforms.

[15] BleepingComputer - CISA: Recently patched RoundCube flaws now exploited in attacks

[TAM METİN - 448 kelime]
CISA flagged two Roundcube Webmail vulnerabilities as actively exploited in attacks and ordered U.S. federal agencies to patch them within three weeks.

Roundcube Webmail is a web-based email client that has been the default mail interface for the widely used cPanel web hosting control panel since 2008.

The first vulnerability tagged as actively abused by threat actors is a critical remote code execution flaw tracked as CVE-2025-49113, which was first flagged as exploited days after it was patched in June 2025, when Internet security watchdog Shadowserver warned that over 84,000 vulnerable Roundcube webmail installations were vulnerable to attacks.

Roundcube patched the second one (CVE-2025-68461) two months ago, in December 2025, warning that remote, unauthenticated attackers can exploit it through low-complexity cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks that abuse the animate tag in SVG documents.

"We strongly recommend to update all productive installations of Roundcube 1.6.x and 1.5.x with this new versions," the Roundcube security team warned when it released versions 1.6.12 and 1.5.12 that address this security flaw.

Shodan currently tracks over 46,000 Roundcube instances accessible on the internet. However, there is no information on how many of them are vulnerable to CVE-2025-49113 or CVE-2025-68461 attacks.

While it didn't provide any details on attacks exploiting these two security flaws, CISA added them to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog on Friday, warning that they are "frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise."

CISA also tracks ten other Roundcube Webmail vulnerabilities that are either actively exploited in attacks or have been abused in the past.

The U.S. cybersecurity agency has ordered Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to secure their systems against these security bugs within three weeks, by March 13, as mandated by a binding operational directive (BOD 22-01) issued in November 2021.

Roundcube vulnerabilities have been a popular target for cybercrime and state-sponsored threat groups, the most recent being a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CVE-2023-5631) exploited by the Winter Vivern (TA473) Russian hacking group in zero-day attacks targeting European government entities and by the Russian APT28 cyber-espionage group to breach Ukrainian government email systems.

[16] Security Affairs - Arkanix Stealer: AI-assisted info-stealer shuts down after brief campaign

Arkanix Stealer: AI-assisted info-stealer shuts down after brief campaign

Arkanix Stealer surfaced in late 2025 as a short-lived info-stealer, likely built as an AI-assisted experiment and quickly abandoned.

Arkanix Stealer emerged in late 2025 as a short-lived information-stealing malware promoted on dark web forums. Researchers believe it was likely created as an AI-assisted experiment, suggesting the operators were testing automated development techniques rather than running a long-term, large-scale cybercriminal operation.

In October 2025, Kaspersky researchers spotted dark web ads for ‘Arkanix Stealer,’ a MaaS offering with a control panel and configurable payloads. It used a C++ build embedding ChromElevator to steal system and crypto wallet data, plus a packed Python version with dynamic configuration. Likely spread via phishing-themed lures, the operation appeared short-lived, and its affiliate program was later shut down.

The ads include a link to a Discord server used as the primary communication channel.

“This stealer is capable of extracting various types of data from supported browsers (22 in total, ranging from the widely popular Google Chrome to the Tor Browser). The list of supported browsers is hardcoded, and unlike other parameters, it cannot be modified during execution.” reads the report published by Kaspersky. “In addition to a separate Chrome grabber module (which we’ll discuss later), the stealer itself supports the extraction of diverse information, such as:

In case of Chromium-based browsers, 0Auth2 data is also extracted”

Browser history (URLs, visit count and last visit)

Autofill information (email, phone, addresses and payment cards details)

Extra modules, including wallet tools and HVNC, can be decrypted and deployed. After completing operations, it deletes itself and related artifacts.

Researchers analyzed both debug and release builds of the native C++ Arkanix Stealer. The release version used VMProtect and the arkanix[.]pw C2, while the debug build relied on a Discord bot and extensive logs. The malware supports anti-analysis checks, patches AMSI and ETW, and steals system, RDP, gaming, browser and screenshot data. It embeds the ChromElevator browser extractor for credential theft and encrypts exfiltrated data with AES-GCM + PBKDF2. The infrastructure observed by the experts included two domains behind Cloudflare hosting a protected panel that was taken offline later.

The group promoted the stealer via Discord with marketing tactics, a referral program and promises of a crypter, suggesting short-lived, possibly AI-assisted development.

“Referrers were promised an additional free hour to their premium license, while invited customers received seven days of free “premium” trial use.” continues the report. “As stated in forum posts, the premium plan included the following features:

Exodus and Atomic cryptocurrency wallets injection

Increased payload generation, up to 10 payloads

The stealer targeted users of cryptocurrency, gaming, and online banking, collecting sensitive data. Likely aided by LLMs, it was a quick, one-shot campaign for fast gains. The developers ran a public forum with updates, surveys, and a referral program, making Arkanix appear more like a marketed software product than a hidden malware operation.

“While being quite functional, it contains probable traces of LLM-assisted development which suggests that such assistance might have drastically reduced development time and costs.” concludes the report. “Hence it follows that this campaign tends to be more of a one-shot campaign for quick financial gains rather than a long-running infection.”

Kaspersky provides a list of indicators of compromise (IoCs).

Operation MacroMaze: APT28 exploits webhooks for covert data exfiltration

Russia-linked APT28 targeted European entities with a webhook-based macro malware campaign called Operation MacroMaze.

Russia-linked APT28 (aka UAC-0001, aka Fancy Bear, Pawn Storm, Sofacy Group, Sednit, BlueDelta, and STRONTIUM) launched Operation MacroMaze, targeting select entities in Western and Central Europe from September 2025 to January 2026. The campaign used webhook-based macro malware, leveraging simple tools and legitimate services for infrastructure and data exfiltration.

The attack chain campaign begins with spear-phishing emails delivering weaponized documents that contain an “INCLUDEPICTURE” field pointing to a webhook[.]site URL hosting a JPG.

“All analyzed documents share a common structural element within their XML: an INCLUDEPICTURE field referencing a remote URL hosted on webhook[.]site.” reads the report published by S2 Grupo’s LAB52 threat intelligence team. “This field is embedded in the document’s XML (w:instrText) and instructs Microsoft Word to retrieve an external image resource when the field is evaluated. The referenced file (docopened.jpg) is fetched from the remote server when the document is opened and fields are updated. This behavior functions as a tracking mechanism: when the document is opened and Word processes the INCLUDEPICTURE field, an outbound HTTP request is generated to the remote server. The server operator can then log metadata associated with the request, effectively confirming that the document has been opened.”

When opened, the file silently retrieves the image, acting like a tracking pixel that alerts attackers the document was viewed. Variants seen between September 2025 and January 2026 use modified macros to drop malware and deploy additional payloads on compromised systems.

Researchers identified four closely related macro variants acting as droppers. Each drops six files (VBS, BAT, CMD, HTM, XHTML) into the %USERPROFILE% folder using GUID-like names tied to a webhook[.]site C2 path. The attackers used heavy string concatenation to hide key commands. The macro launches a VBScript that triggers multi-stage execution, creates a Scheduled Task for persistence, then deletes traces. Over time, the variants evolved from simple document cleanup to fake Word error messages and SendKeys-based UI manipulation to bypass security prompts. Two batch versions follow: one uses Edge in headless mode for stealth, the other hides the browser off-screen and forcefully kills processes for reliability, suppressing certificate errors.

“The final HTML file is constructed by concatenating a static HTM file, the captured output of the reconstructed CMD payload, and a closing XHTML template. The initial HTM file defines an auto-submitting form that sends a POST request to a webhook[.]site endpoint, while the payload output is embedded directly within a element. The closing XHTML fragment completes the document structure.”  continues the report. “When the resulting HTML file is rendered by Microsoft Edge, the form is submitted, causing the collected command output to be exfiltrated to the remote webhook endpoint without user interaction.”

The Operation MacroMaze campaign uses a browser-based exfiltration method that relies on standard HTML features to send stolen data while leaving minimal traces on disk. Although the specific command file used to gather system data was not recovered, similar operations previously attributed to APT28 by CERT Polska and the Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine suggest this stage likely deploys a lightweight reconnaissance script, collecting basic host details such as IP address, directory listings, and system environment information before exfiltration.

“This campaign proves that simplicity can be powerful. The attacker uses very basic tools (batch files, tiny VBS launchers and simple HTML) but arranges them with care to maximise stealth.” concludes the report. “The tooling may be unsophisticated, but the operational tradeoffs are effective. It’s low-tech executed with high craft, which makes detection and attribution harder than the artifacts alone would suggest.”

The APT28 group has been active since at least 2007 and it has targeted governments, militaries, and security organizations worldwide. The group was involved also in the string of attacks that targeted 2016 Presidential election.

The group operates out of military unity 26165 of the Russian General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) 85th Main Special Service Center (GTsSS).

In January 2026, Zscaler ThreatLabz uncovered the campaign Operation Neusploit targeting Central and Eastern Europe. Threat actors targeted the vulnerability CVE-2026-21509, they used weaponized RTF files and localized lures to deploy MiniDoor, PixyNetLoader, and Covenant Grunt implants.

Everest ransomware hits Vikor Scientific ‘s supplier, data of 140,000 patients stolen

Everest ransomware claims an attack on diagnostic firm Vikor Scientific (Vanta Diagnostics), exposing data of nearly 140,000 people.

The Everest ransomware group has claimed responsibility for a cyberattack on Vikor Scientific, now operating as Vanta Diagnostics. The healthcare diagnostic firm disclosed a data breach impacting nearly 139,964 individuals, as reported by the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

The incident stems from the attack on Catalyst RCM, a third-party provider of revenue cycle management services. Around November 13, 2025, Catalyst detected suspicious activity in its secure file system. The company launched an investigation into the incident that revealed that an authorized login was misused to access a server on November 8–9, 2025, and copy data without permission.

In November 2025, the Everest ransomware group added Vikor Scientific and its affiliated labs, KorPath and Korgene, to its Tor data leak site. Catalyst RCM likely did not pay the ransom, and the cybercrime gang published allegedly stolen data, including Vikor Scientific documents.

The group claimed the theft of “internal company documents contains a huge variety of personal documents, EMRs, Patient’s private information, Billing information etc.”.

Everest claimed the theft of the Vikor Scientific database containing 25,303 PDF files (9.39 GB) and Korgene database containing 1,344 PDF Files (505 mb).

Catalyst reviewed the information to identify sensitive data and notify potentially affected individuals, completing this process by December 12, 2025.

“The categories of information that may be involved varies by individual, but could include some combination of name, date of birth, payment card information with access code, medical treatment, history, or diagnosis information, and health insurance information.” reads the data breach notification published by Catalyst RCM.

After discovering the breach, Catalyst notified partners and conducted a thorough review of potentially compromised data, updating policies to prevent future incidents. The company is not aware of any identity theft or fraud, they offer free credit monitoring and identity restoration to the impacted people. Individuals are encouraged to monitor accounts, review credit reports, and follow guidance on freezes, alerts, and protecting personal information.

[19] Security Affairs - Wormable XMRig campaign leverages BYOVD and timed kill switch for stealth

Wormable XMRig campaign leverages BYOVD and timed kill switch for stealth

A wormable cryptojacking campaign spreads via pirated software, using BYOVD and a time-based logic bomb to deploy a custom XMRig miner.

Researchers uncovered a wormable cryptojacking campaign that spreads through pirated software bundles to deploy a custom XMRig miner. The attack uses a BYOVD exploit and a time-based logic bomb to evade detection and maximize mining output. Its multi-stage infection chain focuses on boosting cryptocurrency hashrate, often pushing infected systems to instability in the process.

The campaign spreads through pirated “premium” software installers that drop a sophisticated XMRig-based miner. At its core is a controller binary, Explorer.exe, designed as a persistent state machine that switches roles via command-line arguments (installer, watchdog, active infection, cleanup).

“The “Explorer.exe” binary functions as the primary orchestration node for the infection. In traditional malware design, functionality is often compartmentalized into a linear execution flow: a dropper downloads a payload, executes it, and exits. Explorer.exe (controller), however, operates as a persistent state machine.” reads the report published by Trellix. “It determines its behavioral mode based on the specific command-line arguments passed to it during execution, allowing a single binary file to serve multiple distinct operational roles within the infection lifecycle: installer, watchdog, payload manager, and cleaner”

It separates logic (“brain”) from payloads (“brawn”), which include the miner, watchdogs, and a vulnerable driver (BYOVD) for kernel access.

The malware abuses a legitimate but vulnerable driver called WinRing0x64.sys using a technique known as BYOVD (Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver). Instead of creating its own malicious driver, it loads this old, signed driver to gain kernel-level access (Ring 0 access).

With this access, it modifies specific CPU settings (Model Specific Registers) to disable hardware prefetchers that interfere with Monero’s RandomX mining algorithm. Because RandomX relies on random memory access, turning off these features reduces cache conflicts and boosts mining performance by 15% to 50%.

Payloads are embedded in the binary’s resource section, decompressed, written to disk as hidden system files, and disguised as legitimate software. A circular watchdog system ensures components relaunch each other if terminated, aggressively restarting the miner and even killing the real Windows Explorer to disrupt users.

The malware includes a time-based kill switch set to December 23, 2025, triggering a controlled cleanup routine.

“A significant discovery within the sub_14000D180 function is a hardcoded temporal check, serving as a “kill switch” or “time bomb.” This mechanism operates by retrieving the local system time and comparing it against a predetermined deadline: December 23, 2025.” continues the report. “The malware’s behavior diverges based on this date:

Active phase (Pre-Dec 23, 2025): The malware proceeds with the standard infection routine, installing the persistence modules and launching the miner.

Expiration phase (Post-Dec 23, 2025): This suggests that the campaign is not intended to be an indefinite operation. It implies a “fire-and-forget” lifecycle, possibly timed to coincide with the expiration of rented Command & Control (C2) infrastructure, a predicted shift in the cryptocurrency market (specifically Monero difficulty adjustments), or a planned transition to a new malware variant.”

This XMRig variant includes a worm module that spreads through USB drives, not just manual downloads. It quietly listens for new removable devices using Windows system notifications instead of constantly scanning for them. When a USB drive is inserted, the malware copies its explorer.exe file onto the device, hides it in a folder, and creates a malicious shortcut disguised as the drive icon. When the USB is opened on another computer, the shortcut can execute the malware, enabling further spread.

The threat actor appears to be testing the infection chain and persistence features, including the “Barusu” kill switch, on a limited number of systems before scaling up. Mining pool data shows one active worker with a modest hashrate, with sporadic activity in November 2025 and a noticeable spike starting December 8, suggesting a fresh rollout or activation of new infected nodes.

“This campaign serves as a potent reminder that commodity malware continues to innovate. By chaining together social engineering, legitimate software masquerades, worm-like propagation, and kernel-level exploitation, the attackers have created a resilient and highly efficient botnet.” concludes the report. “The use of the BYOVD technique, in particular, highlights a critical weakness in modern OS security models: the trust placed in signed drivers.”

Romanian hacker pleads guilty to selling access to Oregon state networks

A Romanian man pleaded guilty to selling admin access to Oregon’s state network for $3,000 in Bitcoin and repeatedly accessing it to prove control.

Catalin Dragomir (45) from Romania, pleaded guilty in the U.S. for selling unauthorized admin access to an Oregon state emergency management network. He gained access in June 2021, advertised it, and negotiated a $3,000 Bitcoin sale. According to DoJ, the man repeatedly accessed the system to demonstrate he controlled it.

“According to court documents, Catalin Dragomir, 45, formerly of Constanta, Romania, sold access to a computer on the network of an Oregon state government office after obtaining unauthorized access to it in June of 2021.” reads the press release published by DoJ. “During the sale of access to the computer, Dragomir provided the prospective buyer with samples of personal identifying information from the computer.”

The Romanian national also sold access to the computer networks of many other US victims, causing over $250,000 losses.

Catalin Dragomir was arrested in Romania in November 2024 and extradited to the U.S. in January 2025. He pleaded guilty to obtaining information from a protected computer and aggravated identity theft. Sentencing is set for May 26, 2026, with a maximum of five years for the first count and a mandatory two-year consecutive term for identity theft, pending the judge’s review of sentencing guidelines and statutory factors.

CVE-2026-1731 fuels ongoing attacks on BeyondTrust remote access products

Attackers are exploiting CVE-2026-1731 in BeyondTrust RS and PRA to deploy VShell, gain persistence, move laterally, and control compromised systems.

Threat actors are actively exploiting a recently disclosed critical vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2026-1731 (CVSS score: 9.9), in BeyondTrust Remote Support (RS) and Privileged Remote Access (PRA).

The flaw is being used to conduct a wide range of malicious activities, including deploying VShell and other tools to gain persistence, move laterally, and maintain remote control over compromised systems.

Recenlty, BeyondTrust released security updates to address the critical flaw in its Remote Support and older Privileged Remote Access products. The bug could allow an unauthenticated attacker to send specially crafted requests and run operating system commands remotely, without logging in. The issue, disclosed on February 6, 2026, could lead to full remote code execution if exploited, making the updates essential to prevent abuse.

“BeyondTrust Remote Support (RS) and certain older versions of Privileged Remote Access (PRA) contain a critical pre-authentication remote code execution vulnerability.” reads the advisory. “By sending specially crafted requests, an unauthenticated remote attacker may be able to execute operating system commands in the context of the site user.”

Exploiting the flaw would let a remote attacker run system commands without authentication or user interaction, potentially leading to full system compromise, data theft, and service disruption.

BeyondTrust released patches for CVE-2026-1731 on February 6 after Hacktron researchers warned that about thousands of instances were exposed online.

Hacktron AI team reported that roughly 11,000 BeyondTrust Remote Support instances are exposed online across cloud and on-prem environments. Around 8,500 of these are on-prem systems and could remain vulnerable if not patched. The affected deployments are mainly used by large organizations, including enterprises in healthcare, financial services, government, and hospitality sectors.

After a PoC exploit went public on February 10, GreyNoise detected attack attempts within 24 hours, with one IP responsible for most reconnaissance activity.

In a new report, Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 confirmed the flaw is being actively exploited for reconnaissance, web shell deployment, C2 activity, backdoor installation, lateral movement, and data theft. The campaign has hit multiple sectors, including finance, legal, tech, education, retail, and healthcare, across the U.S., France, Germany, Australia, and Canada.

Threat actors used a custom Python script to briefly hijack the main admin account (User ID 1) for 60 seconds.

“The Python script functions by querying the target’s database to back up the existing password hash for the primary administrator (User ID 1). It leverages the application’s own authentication binary (check_auth) to generate a valid hash for the password string password and injects the hash into the database.” reads the report published by Palo Alto Networks.

The script backed up the original password hash, generated a valid one for a known password, injected it into the database, then restored the original hash and deleted itself—minimizing traces and evading detection.

Unit 42 observed attackers deploying multiple web shells, including one-line, password-protected PHP backdoors that execute Base64-encoded commands via eval() without writing extra files. The researchers spotted the usage of a more advanced shell (aws.php) that acted as a stealth C2 gate, echoing markers linked to tools like China Chopper. A bash dropper used “config STOMPing” to persist by loading a malicious Apache configuration into memory while keeping disk files clean.

The campaign also leveraged SparkRAT, VShell, PowerShell downloaders, a multi-method Linux “download-and-execute” cradle, and attempted Meterpreter reverse shells over port 4444.

Recently, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency warned that CVE-2026-1731 has been actively exploited in ransomware campaigns, prompting a revision of its KEV catalog entry.

AI-powered campaign compromises 600 FortiGate systems worldwide

A Russian-speaking cybercriminal used commercial generative AI tools to hack over 600 FortiGate devices across 55 countries.

Amazon Threat Intelligence reports that a Russian-speaking, financially motivated threat actor used commercial generative AI services to compromise more than 600 FortiGate devices in 55 countries. The activity, observed between January 11 and February 18, 2026, highlights how cybercriminals are increasingly leveraging AI tools to scale and automate attacks against exposed network infrastructure worldwide.

The attacker did not exploit any FortiGate vulnerabilities. Instead, the threat actor abused exposed management ports and weak single-factor credentials.

“Amazon Threat Intelligence observed a Russian-speaking financially motivated threat actor leveraging multiple commercial generative AI services to compromise over 600 FortiGate devices across more than 55 countries from January 11 to February 18, 2026.” reads the report published by Amazon. “No exploitation of FortiGate vulnerabilities was observed—instead, this campaign succeeded by exploiting exposed management ports and weak credentials with single-factor authentication, fundamental security gaps that AI helped an unsophisticated actor exploit at scale.”

Researchers found the actor used multiple commercial GenAI tools to automate and scale familiar attack techniques, despite limited skills.

During routine monitoring, Amazon experts uncovered infrastructure hosting the attacker’s tools, along with AI-generated attack plans, victim configs, and custom code, offering rare insight into an AI-driven workflow. The actor scanned the Internet for exposed FortiGate management ports, abused weak credentials, and stole full configurations containing VPN, admin, and network data.

“Following VPN access to victim networks, the threat actor deploys a custom reconnaissance tool, with different versions written in both Go and Python. Analysis of the source code reveals clear indicators of AI-assisted development: redundant comments that merely restate function names, simplistic architecture with disproportionate investment in formatting over functionality, naive JSON parsing via string matching rather than proper deserialization, and compatibility shims for language built-ins with empty documentation stubs.” continues the report. “While functional for the threat actor’s specific use case, the tooling lacks robustness and fails under edge cases—characteristics typical of AI-generated code used without significant refinement.”

AI-assisted scripts parsed and decrypted the loot, enabling VPN access, Active Directory compromise, credential dumping, lateral movement, and attempts to target Veeam backups. This last step is a classic tactic observed in ransomware attacks

Custom reconnaissance tools, seemingly AI-generated, automated network mapping and vulnerability scanning but lacked depth, often failing against patched or hardened systems. The actor relied on multiple commercial LLMs for planning and code generation, creating a large toolkit that mimicked a full team’s output. Still, when exploits failed or defenses were strong, they moved on, showing AI amplified scale and efficiency, not true technical sophistication.

Once inside, the attacker used common open-source tools to escalate access. They compromised Active Directory, extracting NTLM hashes and, in some cases, entire credential databases—sometimes helped by weak or reused admin passwords. After gaining domain control, they moved laterally using pass-the-hash and NTLM relay attacks, and targeted Veeam backup servers to steal credentials and weaken recovery options. However, when systems were patched or hardened, their more advanced exploitation attempts largely failed.

“The threat actor’s operational notes reference multiple CVEs across various targets (CVE-2019-7192, CVE-2023-27532, and CVE-2024-40711, among others). However, a critical finding from this analysis is that the threat actor largely failed when attempting to exploit anything beyond the most straightforward, automated attack paths.”

Amazon Threat Intelligence experts believe the attacker is financially motivated, Russian-speaking individual or small group with low-to-medium skills boosted heavily by AI. Their post-exploitation skills are shallow, often failing against hardened targets and moving on. Poor operational security exposed detailed plans, credentials, and victim data.

Amazon Threat Intelligence investigated and disrupted the campaign, sharing actionable indicators of compromise with partners and working across the industry to expand visibility and coordinate defenses.

“Through these efforts, Amazon helped reduce the threat actor’s operational effectiveness and enabled organizations across multiple countries to take steps to disrupt the efficacy of the campaign.” concludes the report that includes Indicators of compromise (IOCs) along with recommendations.

The case shows how AI lowers the barrier to cybercrime. Experts warn AI-driven attacks will grow in 2026, urging strong patching, credential hygiene, segmentation, and detection.

Anthropic unveils Claude Code Security to detect and fix code bugs

Anthropic launches Claude Code Security, an AI tool that scans code for vulnerabilities and suggests how to address them.

Anthropic has introduced Claude Code Security, a new AI-powered service designed to scan software codebases for vulnerabilities and recommend fixes. Built into Claude Code, the tool aims to help teams detect and remediate security flaws faster. The capability is currently being rolled out in a limited research preview for Enterprise and Team customers.

“Claude Code Security, a new capability built into Claude Code on the web, is now available in a limited research preview. It scans codebases for security vulnerabilities and suggests targeted software patches for human review, allowing teams to find and fix security issues that traditional methods often miss.” reads the announcement published by Anthropic.

Claude Code Security is designed to discover complex, high-severity software vulnerabilities. Unlike traditional rule-based scanners, it analyzes code like a human researcher, focusing on data flows, understanding component interactions, and catching issues others miss. Each finding undergoes multi-stage verification, is assigned a severity and confidence rating, and appears in a dashboard for human review.

“Every finding goes through a multi-stage verification process before it reaches an analyst. Claude re-examines each result, attempting to prove or disprove its own findings and filter out false positives.” continues the announcement. “Findings are also assigned severity ratings so teams can focus on the most important fixes first.”

Currently in limited research preview for Enterprise, Team, and open-source maintainers, it empowers defenders while ensuring responsible deployment.

Claude Code Security leverages over a year of research into Claude’s cybersecurity skills. Tested in Capture-the-Flag events and in partnership with Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Claude has been refined to detect and patch real vulnerabilities. Using Claude Opus 4.6, the team discovered 500+ long-undetected bugs in open-source projects. Now, Claude Code Security brings these defensive capabilities to Enterprise, Team, and open-source maintainers, letting teams review findings and iterate on fixes directly within familiar tools.

“This is a pivotal time for cybersecurity. We expect that a significant share of the world’s code will be scanned by AI in the near future, given how effective models have become at finding long-hidden bugs and security issues.” concludes Anthropic. “Attackers will use AI to find exploitable weaknesses faster than ever. But defenders who move quickly can find those same weaknesses, patch them, and reduce the risk of an attack.”

Anthropic is launching a limited research preview of Claude Code Security for Enterprise and Team customers, with early access and collaboration. Open-source maintainers can apply for free, expedited access.

Another day, another malicious JPEG

In his last two diaries, Xavier discussed recent malware campaigns that download JPEG files with embedded malicious payload[1,2]. At that point in time, I’ve not come across the malicious “MSI image” myself, but while I was going over malware samples that were caught by one of my customer’s e-mail proxies during last week, I found another campaign in which the same technique was used.

Xavier already discussed how the final portion of a payload that was embedded in the JPEG was employed, but since the campaign he came across used a batch downloader as the first stage, and the one I found employed JScript instead, I thought it might be worthwhile to look at the first part of the infection chain in more detail, and discuss few tips and tricks that may ease analysis of malicious scripts along the way.

To that end, we should start with the e-mail to which the JScript file (in a GZIP “envelope”) was attached.

The e-mail had a spoofed sender address to make it look like it came from a legitimate Czech company, and in its body was present a logo of the same organization, so at first glance, it might have looked somewhat trustworthy. Nevertheless, this would only hold if the message didn’t fail the usual DMARC/SPF checks, which it did, and therefore would probably be quarantined by most e-mail servers, regardless of the malicious attachment.

As we’ve already mentioned, the attachment was a JScript file. It was quite a large one, “weighing in” at 1.17 MB. The large file size was caused by a first layer of obfuscation. The script contained 17,222 lines, of which 17,188 were the same, as you can see in the following image.

Once these were removed, only 34 lines (29 not counting empty ones) remained, and the file size shrank to only 31 kB.

The first 10 lines are an attempt at achieving elementary persistence – the code is supposed to copy the JScript file to the startup folder.

The intent of the remaining 19 lines is somewhat less clear, since they are protected using some basic obfuscation techniques.

In cases where only few lines of obfuscated malicious code remain (and not necessarily just then), it is often beneficial to start the analysis at the end and work upwards.

Here, we see that the last three lines of code may be ignored, as they are intended only to show an error message if the script fails. The only thing that might be of interest in terms of CTI is the fact that the error message is written in Brazilian Portuguese.

Right above the error handling code, we see a call using four different variables – childfree, salsas, Alexia and hypodermical, which are defined right above. In all of them, the same obfuscation technique is used – simple inclusion of the identical, strange looking string. If we remove it, and clean up the code a little bit, we can clearly see that the script constructs a PowerShell command line and then leverages WMI’s Win32_Process.Create method[3] to spawn a hidden PowerShell instance. That instance decodes the Base64-encoded contents of the whatsamatta variable using UTF-8 and executes the resulting script via Invoke-Expression.

At this point, the only thing remaining would be to look at the “whatsamatta” variable. Even here, the “begin at the end” approach can help us, since if we were to look at the final characters of the line that defines it, we would see that it was obfuscated in the same manner as the previously discussed variables (simple inclusion of a garbage string), only this time using different characters, since it ended in the following code:

If we removed this final layer of obfuscation, we would end up with an ~2kB of Base64 encoded PowerShell. To decode Base64, we could use CyberChef or any other appropriate tool.

We would then get just the following 17 lines of code, where the same type of obfuscation discussed previously was used.

We can clearly see that the “connected” variable contains a URL, from which the next stage of the payload is supposed to be downloaded. At this point, we could slightly modify the code and let it deobfuscate the string  automatically[4], or do it manually, since it would mean doing just four replacements. In either case, we would end up with the following URL:

At the time of writing, the URL was no longer live, but from VirusTotal, we can learn that the file would have been a JPEG (with a PNG extension), also distributed under the name optimized_msi.png[5,6], which is a file name that Xavier observed being used in his latest diary.

If we go back to our code, we can see that a Base64-encoded string would be parsed out from the downloaded image file and loaded using reflection, after which its Main method would be called using the arguments contained in the “argsBase64” variable. So, although we lack the image with the actual payload, we can at least look at what parameters would be passed to it.

Simply decoding the string would give us the following:

As we can see, it is probable that the Downloads folder would be used in some way, as well as Windows command line, but we might also notice the one remaining obfuscated string in first position. It is obfuscated only by reversing the order of characters and Base64 encoding. This can be deduced from the two equal signs at the beginning, since one or two equal signs are often present at the end of Base64 encoded strings. If we were to decode this string, we would get the following URL:

Unlike the previous URL, this one was still active at the time of writing. The TXT file contained a reversed, Base64 encoded EXE file, which – according to information found on VirusTotal[7] for its hash – turned out to be a sample of Remcos RAT. So, even though we lack one part of the infection chain, we can quite reasonably assume that this particular malware was its intended final stage.

[27] Cyberscoop - CrowdStrike says attackers are moving through networks in under 30 minutes

CrowdStrike says attackers are moving through networks in under 30 minutes

Cyberattacks reached victims faster and came from a wider range of threat groups than ever last year, CrowdStrike said in its annual global threat report released Tuesday, adding that cybercriminals and nation-states increasingly relied on predictable tactics to evade detection by exploiting trusted systems.

The average breakout time — how long it took financially-motivated attackers to move from initial intrusion to other network systems — dropped to 29 minutes in 2025, a 65% increase in speed from the year prior. “The fastest breakout time a year ago was 51 seconds. This year it’s 27 seconds,” Adam Meyers, head of counter adversary operations at CrowdStrike, told CyberScoop.

Defenders are falling behind because attackers are refining their techniques, using social engineering to access high-privilege systems faster and move through victims’ cloud infrastructure undetected.

“Threat actors are exploiting those cross-domain gaps to gain access to environments, so they’re wriggling in between the seams in cloud, identity, enterprise and unmanaged network devices,” Meyers said.

Starting from an already disadvantaged position — made worse by faster attacks and living-off-the-land techniques — defenders face burnout, stress and other factors that can lead to mistakes, he added.

The myriad sources of these problems are spreading, too.

CrowdStrike tracked 281 threat groups at the end of 2025, including 24 new threats it named throughout the year. Researchers at the cybersecurity firm are also tracking 150 active malicious activity clusters and emerging threat groups.

Cybercriminals seeking a payout and nation states committing espionage or implanting footholds into critical infrastructure for prolonged access are increasingly seizing on security weaknesses in cloud-based environments to break into victim networks.

These cloud-focused attacks have seen a reported 37% year-over-year increase, with a 266% surge in this activity from nation-state threat groups.

The vast majority of attacks detected last year, 82%, were free of malware — highlighting attackers’ enduring shift toward hands-on-keyboard operations and the abuse of legitimate tools and credentials, CrowdStrike said in the report. More than 1 in 3 incident response cases involving cloud intrusions last year were linked back to a valid or abused credential that granted attackers access, according to CrowdStrike.

Attacks originating from or sponsored by North Korea increased 130% last year, while incidents linked to China jumped 38% during the same period.

Chinese threat groups achieved immediate system access with two-thirds of the vulnerabilities they exploited last year, and 40% of those exploits targeted edge devices.

Zero-day exploits — especially defects in edge devices such as firewalls, routers and virtual private networks — allowed nation-state and cybercrime threat groups to break into systems, execute code and escalate privileges undetected.

CrowdStrike said it observed a 42% year-over-year increase in the number of zero-day vulnerabilities exploited prior to public disclosure last year.

Meyers said he expects that number to grow further, predicting an explosion of activity from attackers using artificial intelligence to find and exploit zero-day vulnerabilities in various products during the next three to nine months.

CrowdStrike’s annual global threat report is full of figures moving in the wrong direction, yet the most worrying finding for Meyers comes down to attacker speed.

“The speed at which we’re seeing these breakout times accelerate is one of the markers,” he said, adding that it’s only a matter of time before the fastest attacks drop down to seconds, if not milliseconds.

Anthropic accuses Chinese labs of trying to illicitly take Claude’s capabilities

Anthropic on Monday accused three Chinese artificial intelligence laboratories of stealthily trying to siphon Claude’s capabilities for their own models, potentially in a way that could fuel offensive cyber operations.

The U.S. AI startup said the three labs, DeepSeek, Moonshot and MiniMax, ran “industrial-scale campaigns” with a tactic known as “distillation.” It involves sending bulk requests to its Claude model in a bid to boost their own — in this case, 16 million in all. Distillation can be a legitimate training method practice, the company said in a blog post, but not when used as a shortcut to take capabilities from competitors.

“Illicitly distilled models lack necessary safeguards, creating significant national security risks,” Anthropic argued. “Foreign labs that distill American models can then feed these unprotected capabilities into military, intelligence, and surveillance systems — enabling authoritarian governments to deploy frontier AI for offensive cyber operations, disinformation campaigns, and mass surveillance.”

It’s not the first time Anthropic has warned about Chinese threats stemming from the nation’s use of Claude. And Anthropic paired its revelations about the distillation campaign with repeating its call for stronger export controls.

OpenAI also has accused DeepSeek of using distillation techniques. CyberScoop could not immediately reach the three Chinese labs for comment on Anthropic’s claims.

“The three distillation campaigns … followed a similar playbook, using fraudulent accounts and proxy services to access Claude at scale while evading detection,” Anthropic said. “The volume, structure, and focus of the prompts were distinct from normal usage patterns, reflecting deliberate capability extraction rather than legitimate use.”

In all, the labs used 24,000 fraudulent accounts, Anthropic said. DeepSeek was responsible for 150,000 of the exchanges, compared to 3.4 million from Moonshot and 13 million from MiniMax, according to the startup. The activity violated terms of service and regional access restrictions, it said.

What makes the tactic illegitimate is that it essentially steals Anthropic’s intellectual property, computing power and effort, said Gal Elbaz, co-founder and chief technology officer of Oligo Security, which bills itself as an AI runtime security company.

“The scary part is, you can take all of the power and unleash it, because you don’t have anyone that actually enforces those guardrails on the other side,” Elbaz told CyberScoop about the fears Anthropic raised about the labs fueling cyberattacks.

AI companies themselves have faced claims that they are stealing data and IP from others to power their models.

[29] The Register - Suspected Anonymous members detained in Spain over post-flood DDoS blitz

Suspected Anonymous members detained in Spain over post-flood DDoS blitz

Quartet accused of attacking public institutions, claiming the government was responsible for 2024 tragedy

Spanish police say four self-proclaimed members of Anonymous are in custody after allegedly carrying out several cyberattacks on public authorities in the wake of the 2024 DANA floods.

Guardia Civil officers arrested two of Anonymous Fénix's "most active members" last week in Ibiza and Móstoles, Madrid. These bring the total to four, following the arrest of two group leaders in Alcalá de Henares, Madrid, and Oviedo, Asturias, in May 2025.

All four were detained for carrying out distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks on government ministries, political parties, and public institutions, which they claimed were "responsible for the tragedy" of the floods.

Referred to in Spanish as DANA (Depresión Aislada en Niveles Altos), the floods of 2024 were caused by cold high-altitude, low-pressure systems that led to heavy rainfall and storms.

In October 2024, a DANA event struck various regions in Spain, such as Albacete, Almería, and Málaga, but hit the coastal city of Valencia the hardest.

More than 230 people died as a result of the intense floods that ripped through regions of the country, 229 of which were recorded in Valencia. Some reports suggest that around a third of children in the city still experience fear whenever they hear rainfall.

Many Spaniards blamed the government for its poor handling of the disaster, claiming that the authorities were not adequately prepared to handle such a crisis.

The police declined to name any of the four members, but a court order allowed the seizure of Anonymous Fénix's X profile and YouTube account, and officials closed its Telegram account.

After spinning up as an Anonymous offshoot in 2023, the group was most active on X and Telegram, reposting news about the natural disaster. By 2024, it was using the platforms to recruit members to join its hacktivism.

Guardia Civil did not specify any of the public institutions that were attacked, but said several of the attempts on government websites were successful.

Originating around 2003 on 4chan, Anonymous and its adoption of Guy Fawkes masks quickly became synonymous with hacktivism.

The disparate group of global volunteers helped establish Anonymous as a leading hacktivist group, thanks in large part to successful attacks on the likes of Sony and PayPal, a long-running campaign against Scientology, and in the early years, large-scale pranks on websites like Habbo Hotel.

Its presence today is diminished compared to its heyday, although splinter groups like Fénix still pop up occasionally. ®

AWS says more than 600 FortiGate firewalls hit in AI-augmented campaign

Off-the-shelf tools helped Russian-speaking cybercrime group run riot

Cybercriminals armed with off-the-shelf generative AI tools compromised more than 600 internet-exposed FortiGate firewalls across 55 countries in just over a month, according to a new incident report from AWS.

The campaign, which ran from mid-January to mid-February, relied less on clever zero-days and more on the equivalent of trying every digital door handle – just at machine speed, with AI lending a hand behind the scenes.

AWS says the financially motivated Russian-speaking crew behind the campaign scanned for exposed FortiGate management interfaces, tried commonly reused or weak credentials, and then hoovered up configuration files once inside, giving them a roadmap of victim networks.

The cloud giant's security team says the actor used multiple commercial AI tools to generate attack playbooks, scripts, and operational notes, effectively allowing a relatively low-skilled outfit to run a campaign that would previously have required more people or time. Investigators even found evidence of AI-generated code and planning artifacts on compromised infrastructure, suggesting the tools were embedded throughout the workflow rather than just used for the odd bit of scripting.

"The volume and variety of custom tooling would typically indicate a well-resourced development team," said CJ Moses, CISO at Amazon. "Instead, a single actor or very small group generated this entire toolkit through AI-assisted development."

Once the firewall was cracked, the attackers pulled configuration files containing administrator and VPN credentials, network topology details, and firewall rules. From there, they moved deeper into environments, going after Active Directory, dumping credentials, and probing for ways to move laterally. Backup systems, including Veeam servers, were also on the shopping list.

AWS says the tooling it observed was functional but rough around the edges, with simplistic parsing logic and the sort of redundant comments that suggest a machine wrote the first draft. That didn't stop it from being effective enough for broad automation, though the miscreants reportedly tended to abandon targets that put up too much resistance and move on to softer ones, reinforcing the idea that volume rather than finesse was the winning strategy.

Geographically, the activity was opportunistic rather than tightly targeted, with victims spread across multiple regions, including parts of Europe, Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Clusters of activity suggested that some compromises may have enabled access to managed service providers or larger shared environments, amplifying downstream risk.

The report leans heavily on the idea that basic hygiene – keeping management interfaces off the public internet, enforcing multi-factor authentication, and not recycling passwords – would have shut down much of the activity before it got going.

The findings land just weeks after Google warned that criminals are increasingly wiring generative AI directly into their operations, including its own Gemini AI chatbot, for tasks ranging from reconnaissance and target profiling to phishing and malware development. ®

Attacker gets into France's database listing all bank accounts, makes off with 1.2 million records

PLUS: Unpatched Ivanti boxes under attack; 0APT might not be a scam; AI gets better at helping cyber-scum; And more

Infosec In Brief An unknown attacker accessed the French government’s database listing every bank account in the country and made off with 1.2 million records.

France’s Ministry of Economics, Finance and Industrial and Digital Sovereignty last week revealed the incident took place in January, after unknown attackers used stolen credentials to access the database.

The Ministry said the attacker's access was restricted immediately upon discovery of the attack, but that the miscreant still managed to access personal information about 1.2 million accounts, including account numbers, account holder’s addresses, and tax identification numbers.

France’s government has mobilized the agencies that fight this sort of incident, and warned account holders to be on the lookout for suspicious messages.

0days in Ivanti's EPMM under attack

Palo Alto Networks' Unit 42 reported last week that the pair of zero-days in Ivanti Endpoint Manager for Mobile (EPMM) that the vendor patched last month are proving popular with attackers.

According to Unit 42 researchers, cyber-scum are aware of the two 9.8-rated CVEs – CVE-2026-1281 and CVE-2026-1340 – and are targeting unpatched systems.

State and local governments, healthcare, manufacturing, professional and legal services, and the tech sector in the US, Germany, Australia, and Canada have all been peppered by attackers leveraging those vulnerabilities.

Unit 42 reports that attackers have tried to exploit them by establishing a reverse shell, installing web shells, downloading malware, and conducting reconnaissance in a search for further vulnerabilities.

The researchers noted that patches are available for both vulnerabilities and point out that installation doesn’t require downtime, so deserves a prominent place on owners’ to-do lists.

0APT a hoax? Not so fast, say researchers

You may recall in last week's security roundup that we wrote about GuidePoint Security’s opinion that a group calling itself 0APT appears to be a fake gang using other cybercriminals' ill-gotten data to pass off as their own.

Researchers with security firm Cyderes' Howler Cell threat research team reached out to warn us not to ignore the group, as there are signs it's a real threat.

According to Howler Cell's research, 0APT's initial presence might be mostly fake, but "the operators behind 0APT are running an active Ransomware-as-a-service platform with functional malicious payloads and a working affiliate model."

Howler Cell warns that the bluff may have been an attempt to attract attention, like we said, but not just to scam victims – they may also be trying to attract affiliates by making quick reputation gains.

Howler Cell said that it managed to access the group's ransomware-as-a-service portal, collecting malware samples that were fully viable and just waiting to be deployed.

"The 0APT ransomware demonstrates a clear focus on reliability, operator configurability, and secure cryptographic implementation, aligning with modern trends in Rust‑based ransomware development," Howler Cell said.

Telcos aren't saying how they fought back against China's Salt Typhoon attacks

Open-source AI is a global security nightmare waiting to happen, say researchers

AI helps cybercrims move faster, do more

AI is rapidly becoming a cybercriminal's best friend, serving as a force multiplier that is increasing attacker success rates at each stage of a campaign.

Unit 42 said in its 2026 Global Incident Response Report published last week that AI contributed to a quadrupling of exfiltration speeds in 2025, making it one of the most dangerous emerging threats for the coming year.

"AI is changing the economics of intrusions," Unit 42 said in the report. "It increases attacker speed, scale and effectiveness while opening entirely new attack vectors."

We've known that AI has helped cybercriminals for a while. Unit 42's report, however, suggests whatever trends we've seen to date are only going to accelerate and make the problem worse.

AI is enabling attackers to move faster to exploit vulnerabilities, with Unit 42 saying it has seen signs that attackers are using AI to help them scan for exposed vulnerabilities within 15 minutes of a CVE being announced.

"Exploitation attempts often begin before many security teams have even finished reading the vulnerability advisory," Unit 42 noted. AI assistance has meant that time-to-exfiltration can be as little as 25 minutes, according to Unit 42's simulations.

AI is further lowering the barrier to entry for new attackers too, by making it easy to personalize social engineering exploits and keeping them free of the spelling and grammar errors that betray their nature.

Constant vigilance and a new line of defenses will be needed to keep up with this latest generation of AI threats, tips for which are included in the Unit 42 report.

Tenga leaks customer details

Sex toy manufacturer Tenga said a "limited segment" of its US customer base who interacted with company support reps have had their details spilled.

Cybercriminals obtained correspondence history and customer email addresses (no other PII or financial information, but even that limited bit of data could get embarrassing) by probing a single employee's email account, the company said.

It seems a malicious email campaign may also be involved using the addresses obtained by the digi-crook, as Tenga is also warning customers caught in the leak not to open suspicious attachments.

The company said it's already been in touch with affected customers, and said it intends to use more protection to prevent another such incident in the future. ®

[32] TechCrunch Security - Americans are destroying Flock surveillance cameras
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[TAM METİN - 731 kelime]
Brian Merchant, writing for Blood in the Machine, reports that people across the United States are dismantling and destroying Flock surveillance cameras, amid rising public anger that the license plate readers aid U.S. immigration authorities and deportations.

Flock is the Atlanta-based surveillance startup valued at $7.5 billion a year ago and a maker of license plate readers. It has faced criticism for allowing federal authorities access to its massive network of nationwide license plate readers and databases at a time when U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is increasingly relying on data to raid communities as part of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.

Flock cameras allow authorities to track where people go and when by taking photos of their license plates from thousands of cameras located across the United States. Flock claims it doesn’t share data with ICE directly, but reports show that local police have shared their own access to Flock cameras and its databases with federal authorities.

While some communities are calling on their cities to end their contracts with Flock, others are taking matters into their own hands.

Merchant reports instances of broken and smashed Flock cameras in La Mesa, California, just weeks after the city council approved the continuation of Flock cameras deployed in the city, despite a clear majority of attendees favoring their shutdown. A local report cited strong opposition to the surveillance technology, with residents raising privacy concerns.

Other cases of vandalism have stretched from California and Connecticut to Illinois and Virginia. In Oregon, six license plate-scanning cameras on poles were cut down and at least one spray-painted. A note left at the base of the severed poles said, “Hahaha get wrecked ya surveilling fucks,” reports Merchant.

According to DeFlock, a project aimed at mapping license plate readers, there are close to 80,000 cameras across the United States. Dozens of cities have so far rejected the use of Flock’s cameras, and some police departments have since blocked federal authorities from using their resources.

A Flock spokesperson did not say, when reached by TechCrunch, if the company keeps track of how many cameras have been destroyed since being deployed.

[33] TechCrunch Security - VPN flaws allowed Chinese hackers to compromise dozens of Ivanti customers, says report

[TAM METİN - 762 kelime]
In February 2021, software giant Ivanti discovered that Chinese hackers had breached the network of Pulse Secure, one of its subsidiaries that provided VPN appliances to dozens of companies and government agencies around the world, according to new reporting by Bloomberg.

The hackers exploited preexisting vulnerabilities in Pulse Secure’s VPN software to plant a backdoor, Bloomberg reported, citing Ivanti’s chief security officer at the time and other sources. The backdoor allowed the hackers to gain access to 119 other unnamed organizations that used the company’s same VPN product.

Mandiant was reportedly aware of the breaches as well, alerting Ivanti that hackers had exploited the bug to breach European and U.S. military contractors.

The previously unreported breach is the latest example of how acquisitions, layoffs, and cost-cutting driven by private equity firms helped to compromise the quality and security of Ivanti’s most critical technologies. After private investment giant Clearlake Capital Group acquired Ivanti in 2017, Bloomberg reported rounds of cuts — particularly in 2022 — affecting employees who had deep institutional knowledge of the company’s products and their security.

Ivanti’s spokesperson Carrie Laudie disputed Bloomberg’s reporting and said there was “never a backdoor planted by hackers in Connect Secure.”

Mandiant did not respond to a request for comment.

Bloomberg’s findings echo earlier reporting into rival provider of remote access tools, Citrix, which had large-scale layoffs following a 2022 deal by Elliott Investment Management and Vista Equity Partners to buy the company. Like Ivanti, Citrix has been mired by cybersecurity incidents and critical flaws in recent years.

Ivanti’s VPN products have been the cause of at least two other major attacks since.

In early 2024, U.S. cybersecurity agency CISA ordered all federal agencies to disconnect their Ivanti VPN appliances within two days because hackers were actively exploiting vulnerabilities that were unknown to Ivanti at the time. Ivanti also warned customers last year that hackers were exploiting another critical flaw in its Connect Secure product to hack corporate customers.

This story was updated to include comment from Ivanti’s spokesperson, and to clarify wording in the second paragraph.

Vom Streaming-Portal zum Milliarden-Schatz: Wie die Betreiber von «movie2k.to» mit Bitcoins ein Vermögen anhäuften und wem es jetzt zufallen könnte.

PXLR Studio – shutterstock.com

In Leipzig hat der Prozess um den illegalen Streamingdienst «movie2k.to» und einen Milliardengewinn mit Bitcoins begonnen. Vor dem Landgericht ist der 42 Jahre alte mutmaßliche Kopf des Portals unter anderem wegen gewerbsmäßiger Geldwäsche in 146 Fällen angeklagt. Mit ihm auf der Anklagebank sitzt ein 39-Jähriger, der sich wegen Geldwäsche in 46 Fällen und Steuerhinterziehung verantworten muss. Die Vorwürfe – in rund 220.000 Fällen urheberrechtlich geschützte Werke unerlaubt verwertet zu haben – sind inzwischen verjährt und somit nicht mehr Gegenstand der Verhandlung.

350 Seiten Anklageschrift

Zum Prozessauftakt beanstandete die Verteidigung des Hauptangeklagten die Verlesung der Anklageschrift. Diese hätte in modifizierter Fassung vorgelegt werden müssen, nachdem das Landgericht einige Teile daraus nicht zugelassen hatte. Die Generalstaatsanwaltschaft Dresden betonte, dass die verjährten Taten wichtig für den Vorwurf der Geldwäsche seien. Die Wirtschaftsstrafkammer wies den Antrag der Verteidigung zurück.

Was passiert mit dem Gewinn in Höhe von 2,64 Milliarden Euro?

Brisant ist der Fall, weil die Wirtschaftsstrafkammer auch über den Besitz der rund 2,64 Milliarden Euro entscheidet, die aus dem Bitcoinvermögen des Hauptangeklagten erzielt worden waren. Bei einer rechtskräftigen Verurteilung könnte auch der Landeskasse viel Geld zufließen.

Laut Anklage hatte das Duo mit einem bereits rechtskräftig verurteilten Mann über das Streamingportal «movie2k.to» jahrelang hunderttausende Raubkopien von Filmen und Serie angeboten. Dabei hatten die Betreiber Millioneneinnahmen aus Werbeverträgen erzielt und damit Bitcoins erworben. 2013 wurde das Portal abgeschaltet, der Hauptangeklagte konnte erst 2023 im Ausland festgenommen werden.

Nach seiner Festnahme im Jahr 2023 hatte er den Ermittlern knapp 50.000 Bitcoins übergeben. Der Verkauf brachte nach einem wahren Kurssprung der Kryptowährung etwa 2,64 Milliarden Euro ein. Dieses Geld wird derzeit bei der Landesjustizkasse verwahrt. (dpa/ad)

[36] CSO Online - It’s time to rethink CISO reporting lines
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Tue, 24 Feb 2026 07:00:00 +0000

[TAM METİN - 1083 kelime]
A significant majority of security leaders still report to IT — a situation rife with conflicts of interest given how AI and business risks are spurring CIO and CISO roles to separately evolve, experts say.

Despite inroads in the C-suite and rising prominence across the business at large, security leaders are still more likely to operate at a remove from the organization’s executive leadership when it comes to reporting structures.

According to IANS Research and Artico Search’s 2026 State of the CISO Benchmark Report, 64% of CISOs still report into IT, typically the CIO or CTO. Just 11% report to the CEO, while others fall under the CFO (5%), chief risk officer (5%), legal counsel (5%), or other business roles (5%).

Although the survey found that “reporting lines are slowly shifting, and dotted line responsibility is often just as or more important than direct line reporting,” traditional reporting lines still hold, begging the question: Does that reporting structure still make sense?

The age-old problem with CISOs reporting into CIOs is that it could present — or at least appear to present — a conflict of interest.

Cybersecurity consultant Brian Levine, a former federal prosecutor who serves as executive director of FormerGov, says that concern is even more warranted today.

“It’s the legacy model: Treat security as a technical function instead of an enterprise‑wide risk discipline,” he says. “The problem is that when the CISO sits under the CIO, cost containment may outrank risk reduction.”

Conflicts of interest

Levine agrees that reporting to the CIO creates “an inherent conflict of interest.”

“The CIO is rewarded for efficiency and savings and the CISO is responsible for identifying risks that often require new spending,” he explains. “It’s like asking the fire marshal to report to the person whose bonus depends on cutting the number of sprinklers.”

Enterprise CISOs should be reporting a notch higher, Levine argues.

“Ideally, the CISO would report to the CEO or the general counsel, high-level roles explicitly accountable for enterprise risk. Security is fundamentally a risk and governance function, not a cost‑center function,” Levine points out. “When the CISO has independence and a direct line to the top, organizations make clearer decisions about risk, not just cheaper ones.”

Zach Lewis, CISO at the University of Health Sciences and Pharmacy in St. Louis, agrees that a conflict of interest arises in reporting into IT.

“The CIO is all about [system] availability whereas the CISO needs to bring systems down so that things can be patched, fixed,” Lewis says, offering that a hypothetical CIO might tell a CISO, “I don’t want you to do [a patch or a security upgrade] because it would impact my bonus.”

Flavio Villanustre, CISO for the LexisNexis Risk Solutions Group, sees resources being another conflict of interest.

“In many organizations, IT [executives] are heavily incentivized to deliver new capabilities, which could strain the resources available to the CISO when trying to ensure that security and privacy are baked into these projects,” Villanustre says.

At the same time, having the CISO report into someone such as the general counsel or CFO “could negatively impact the alignment between CISO and IT, which is paramount to making the CISO job more effective,” Villanustre adds. ”Forcing these types of moves could backfire.”

With regulatory pressure mounting, especially in financial services, Villanustre believes CISO reporting structures will come under greater scrutiny. “It’s likely that there will be changes soon that can alter the current statistics [of reporting lines for CISOs] quite significantly,” he says.

What’s in a reporting line?

Aaron Painter, CEO of security vendor Nametag, contends that reporting structures often mean less than the respect the CISO is granted.

Painter is “less dogmatic about where the CISO reports and more focused on whether they actually have a seat at the table,” he says.

“Org charts matter far less than influence,” he adds. “Whether the CISO reports to the CIO, the CEO, or someone else, the real question is this: Are they brought in early, listened to, and empowered to shape how the business operates? When that’s true, the structure works. When it’s not, no reporting line will save it.”

Sanchit Vir Gogia, chief analyst at Greyhound Research, argues that the trend to have CISOs report to an IT executive “is one of the most structurally damaging legacy habits still entrenched in enterprise security governance.”

“On paper, it may seem like a clean alignment,” he says. “In practice, it’s a governance anti-pattern that quietly erodes the CISO’s ability to surface truth, escalate risk, and hold the organization accountable. Keeping security under IT may seem convenient, but in today’s threat landscape, it is a structural vulnerability disguised as tradition.”

Like others, Gogia’s argument falls back to the potential for conflicts of interest.

“The CIO’s job is to enable business through technology. Innovation, delivery, velocity. The CISO’s job is to identify and mitigate risk, even when that slows things down,” Gogia says. “When the CISO reports to the CIO, risk can be filtered, prioritized out of sight, or reshaped to fit a delivery narrative. It’s not about bad actors. It’s about role tension. And when that tension exists within the same reporting line, risk loses.”

Moreover, Gogia believes security reporting to IT “sends all the wrong cultural signals.”

“Employees know where power sits. If the CISO is three levels below the CFO, nobody takes their escalation seriously. If the CISO needs to ask their boss’s permission to flag a critical control gap, that’s not empowerment; it’s containment. Over time, the organization learns to route security around the CISO, not through them,” he says. “What matters most is unfiltered visibility and the freedom to present uncomfortable truths without career penalty.”

Gogia argues in favor of a better reporting structure for cybersecurity.

“We’re seeing the emergence of the chief digital risk officer (CDRO) model, which reframes the role altogether. Rather than being a technologist reporting into infrastructure, the CDRO is a senior executive responsible for digital risk across cyber, data, AI, and third-party exposure,” Gogia says. “This role often sits beside the CRO and CFO, not below them. It reflects the reality that digital risk is not a subset of IT. It is a board-level category in its own right.”

[37] CSO Online - The rise of the evasive adversary
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Tue, 24 Feb 2026 06:30:00 +0000
Link: https://www.csoonline.com/article/4136276/the-rise-of-the-evasive-adversary.html

[TAM METİN - 1366 kelime]
CrowdStrike’s latest annual Global Threat Report finds AI-driven attacks up 89%, zero-day exploitation surging, and nation-state actors doubling down on cloud and edge device compromise.

Since the earliest days of the internet, there has never been a let-up in adversarial activity. According to CrowdStrike’s just-released 12th annual Global Threat Report, malicious activity in cyberspace continues to not only accelerate but also expand its scale and increasingly abuse the trust of targeted organizations.

The good news is that, despite discussion of AI democratizing threat activity, the volume of adversaries that government and corporate entities are contending with didn’t grow at an accelerated rate in 2025, according to CrowdStrike’s findings. “We added 24 new adversaries over the course of the last year, which is equivalent to what we did the year before,” Adam Meyers, head of counter adversary operations at CrowdStrike, told reporters during a roundtable discussion about the report. “We track over 281 adversaries today and 150 activity clusters,” he said.

The main message of CrowdStrike’s report is that threat actors have moved into evasion mode after previously expanding their toolkits. “The theme of the overall report is what we say is the evasive adversary. Last year, it was the enterprising adversary. They were starting to experiment with some of the techniques that we observed. And now their focus is on avoiding detection. So, we’re calling them the evasive adversary,” Meyers said.

Adversarial AI use amplifies known tactics

CrowdStrike’s report shows that attacks carried out by AI-enabled adversaries jumped 89% year over year, as threat actors used generative tools to refine phishing lures, generate malware scripts, troubleshoot exploits, and accelerate reconnaissance. The technology did not create entirely new tactics but made existing ones faster, cheaper, and more scalable.

At the same time, AI-enabled intrusions became quieter, according to CrowdStrike. Malware-free techniques accounted for 82% of detections in 2025, up from 51% in 2020, reflecting a decisive shift toward credential abuse and hands-on-keyboard activity that blends into legitimate user behavior.

“In terms of AI as a weapon, you can use it for social engineering,” Meyers said. “We’ve seen groups like eCrime group Renaissance Spider modify their Click Fix lures and localize them to different languages using generative AI.”

CrowdStrike also witnessed AI being used for information operations, Meyers said. “One of the interesting cases that happened over the last couple of months” is a malicious MCP server named postmark-mcp, which impersonated a legitimate server maintained by email delivery service Postmark, he said. “And in this case, the MCP server, which bridges the Postmark API with the LLM, was maliciously created so that it would actually bcc an adversary on every email that was sent.”

Big game hunters tighten their grip

CrowdStrike’s research highlights how big game hunting (BGH) ransomware actors have remained the dominant force in the eCrime landscape.

Punk Spider, a group responsible for developing and maintaining Russian-language Akira ransomware, and its associated Akira dedicated leak site, conducted 198 intrusions in 2025 — a 134% increase year over year. Victim-shaming operations expanded as well, with a 36.8% rise in organizations named on dedicated leak sites.

But the story for BGH actors in 2025 was not just volume; it was also refinement.

Rather than detonate ransomware on heavily monitored endpoints, BGH actors increasingly encrypt data remotely via Windows Server Message Block (SMB) shares, minimizing their footprint and avoiding the need to execute ransomware on managed hosts.

Other big game hunters exploited unmanaged infrastructure. In one incident, eCrime actor Scattered Spider dumped Active Directory credentials from an unmanaged virtual machine within three hours of initial access — interacting with only a single managed endpoint.

Supply chain attacks become a weapon of scale

One big driver of the evasive tactics used by threat actors in 2025 was supply chain attacks, according to CrowdStrike.

The most dramatic example came in February, when North Korea’s state-sponsored threat actor Pressure Chollima, also known as Lazarus, orchestrated the largest cryptocurrency theft in history, stealing $1.46 billion by compromising SafeWallet, a digital asset management platform that supports cryptocurrency exchange Bybit. By injecting malicious code into a trusted frontend and restoring it immediately after execution, the group redirected funds during a legitimate transaction while avoiding detection.

Open-source ecosystems proved equally vulnerable. A compromised npm package distributing self-propagating infostealer ShaiHulud malware was downloaded more than 2 million times before discovery. In another campaign, adversary-linked packages were downloaded over 8,000 times, often spreading through dependency chains that infected downstream users far beyond the original target.

Zero-day exploitation accelerates

During 2025, the race between disclosure and exploitation narrowed to days, sometimes hours, according to CrowdStrike.

The researchers report that zero-day exploitation rose 42% year over year in 2025, as adversaries weaponized dozens of previously unknown vulnerabilities for initial access, remote code execution, and privilege escalation.

More worrisome is that the average e-crime breakout time — the window between initial access and lateral movement — fell to just 29 minutes, a 65% increase in speed from 2024. In the most extreme case, attackers moved in 27 seconds.

China-nexus actors, in particular, demonstrated rapid operationalization. In multiple cases, exploitation began within two to six days of public disclosure. For defenders, that left little room to assess, prioritize, and patch before networks were probed or compromised.

Zero-days became more than tactical advantages. They became strategic accelerants, enabling stealthy entry into edge devices, VPN appliances, mail servers, and enterprise software before defenses could adjust.

And increasingly, those entry points led straight into the cloud.

Cloud becomes the new battleground

As enterprises deepen their reliance on SaaS and hybrid identity systems, adversaries continue to follow.

CrowdStrike said that cloud-conscious intrusions rose 37% overall in 2025, while activity by state-nexus actors surged 266%. Valid account abuse accounted for 35% of cloud incidents, underscoring how attackers leveraged stolen credentials and session tokens rather than malware.

“What’s really interesting is that 35% of the time, cloud intrusions are effectively using legitimate credentials,” Meyers said. “And we’ve noted that nation-state threat actors have had a 266% increase in cloud-related intrusion activity, which indicates nation-states now have recognized what e-crime actors have been noticing for a few years: The cloud is an ideal target.”

Adversary-in-the-middle phishing kits became a preferred tool, allowing threat actors to intercept authentication flows and capture live session tokens for Microsoft 365 and Salesforce environments. Hybrid identity systems, which synchronize on-premises and cloud authentication, became particularly attractive targets, offering broad access once compromised.

Rather than breaking in, attackers increasingly logged in. And nowhere was that strategy more systematic than in campaigns attributed to China-nexus actors.

China-nexus activity expands across regions and sectors

CrowdStrike’s analysis indicates that China-nexus adversaries increased overall targeted intrusion activity by 38% in 2025, maintaining a sustained global tempo. Logistics targeting rose 85%, telecommunications 30%, and financial services 20%, all sectors aligned with long-term intelligence and economic priorities.

Driving much of the activity was “a massive uptick in zero-day vulnerabilities and exploits being leveraged by Chinese threat actors,” Meyers said.

A consistent pattern emerged: perimeter compromise first. Sixty-seven percent of vulnerabilities exploited by China-nexus actors enabled immediate remote code execution, and 40% targeted edge devices such as VPNs, firewalls, and gateways, infrastructure that often lacks robust monitoring and timely patching. In some campaigns, adversaries operationalized exploits within two to three days of disclosure.

“If you think about actors like Salt Typhoon, which we track as Operator Panda and Vanguard Panda, which is also known as Volt Typhoon, targeting network devices is important for China. They find lots of vulnerabilities there, and they’re able to stay under the radar on those devices because they’re not managed,” Meyers said.

China’s intrusions are never smash-and-grab operations. In multiple cases, actors maintained persistent access for months, sometimes years, prioritizing long-term intelligence collection over short-term disruption, CrowdStrike said.

Taken together, the trends of 2025 tell a clear story. Adversaries are faster, quieter, and more willing to exploit the implicit trust embedded in modern infrastructure — from AI tools and SaaS platforms to open-source code and perimeter devices.

[38] CSO Online - Anthropic’s Claude Code Security rollout is an industry wakeup call
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Tue, 24 Feb 2026 06:07:58 +0000

[TAM METİN - 1552 kelime]
When Anthropic announced the start of testing on Friday, security vendors, and the markets, sat up and took notice. But is the panic warranted?

When Anthropic launched a “limited research preview” of its Claude Code Security offering on Friday, Wall Street investors sent the stocks of the largest cybersecurity vendors plunging.

But did the Anthropic rollout warrant such a reaction?

After all, those companies, including CrowdStrike, Zscaler, Palo Alto Networks and Okta, are preparing their own agentic capabilities, and even if they weren’t, the code-checking capabilities promised by Anthropic are not initially a replacement for their functionality.

“Code security is a vital piece of a cybersecurity program and overall tech stack, but far from the only one” Justin Greis, CEO of consulting firm Acceligence pointed out. “There’s no doubt that improving code security and enhancing the Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) and Product Development Lifecycle (PDLC) will strengthen an organization’s security posture, but it will not eliminate the need for tools and services like EDR/MDR, IAM, threat intel, and data protection.”

He added, “however, this is a clear signal that the AI companies are going to continue to expand their use cases and analyze more and more data, code, and bring real insight and action to security organizations. The pace of their innovation is staggering and unprecedented.”

Keeps a human in the loop

However, Greis offered a warning to CISOs: “For those who blindly rely on any code scanning tool, AI or otherwise, to replace the fundamentals of good security practices and secure coding, this is your red blinking light to not outsource the very expertise that protects the value proposition of the product or service you’re developing. We must keep qualified humans in the loop and ensure we use AI as an accelerator, not a replacement for expertise,” he said.

Anthropic’s announcement stated, “Claude Code Security, a new capability built into Claude Code on the web” will “[scan] codebases for security vulnerabilities and suggest targeted software patches for human review, allowing teams to find and fix security issues that traditional methods often miss.”

The rollout is limited, at least initially, Anthropic said. “We’re releasing it as a limited research preview to Enterprise and Team customers, with expedited access for maintainers of open-source repositories.”

The company did not respond to a request for an interview.

Anticipating concerns that the code-checker will take over security functions rather than augment them, Anthropic stressed that it wants to keep humans in the loop.

“Rather than scanning for known patterns, Claude Code Security reads and reasons about your code the way a human security researcher would: understanding how components interact, tracing how data moves through your application, and catching complex vulnerabilities that rule-based tools miss,” the announcement said. “Every finding goes through a multi-stage verification process before it reaches an analyst. Claude re-examines each result, attempting to prove or disprove its own findings and filter out false positives.”

It noted that validated findings appear in the Claude Code Security dashboard, where teams can review them, inspect the suggested patches, and approve fixes. But, it said, “because these issues often involve nuances that are difficult to assess from source code alone, Claude also provides a confidence rating for each finding. Nothing is applied without human approval: Claude Code Security identifies problems and suggests solutions, but developers always make the call.”

Anchors security posture to the model

However, those assurances didn’t make all concerns evaporate.

“The moment those vibe coders plug a foundation model into their CI pipeline, their entire security posture is no longer anchored only to the company’s code,” I-Gentic AI CEO Zahra Timsah pointed out.

“It is anchored to the current behavior of that model. Anthropic can update weights, adjust reasoning heuristics, refine safety layers, or change how semantic patterns are interpreted. None of that requires your approval. None of that triggers your internal change control. Your pipelines stay green. Your dashboards stay stable. But the engine defining what counts as a vulnerability has changed,” she said.

“Anthropic is in full control. That means your secure codebase today could be evaluated under a different vulnerability boundary tomorrow without you touching a single line. This is outsourcing part of your security definition to an upstream probabilistic system you do not control.”

Outsourcing dependence is nothing new

But others have suggested that the security outsourcing has been gradually happening for years, starting with cloud operations and SaaS, then moving to cybersecurity firms that took increasing control of enterprise cyber operations, and finally to genAI and agentic vendors.

Flavio Villanustre, CISO for the LexisNexis Risk Solutions Group, applauded the fact that Anthropic is at least giving lip service to humans overseeing the process, but, he noted, “this doesn’t mean that people will not cut corners in some cases and add yet another LLM with non-deterministic behavior to the existing problem of code generation by an LLM with non-deterministic behavior too.”

An ever-present concern about both agentic and generative AI systems is their tendency to hallucinate, in addition to having other reliability challenges. But several cybersecurity specialists said that is nothing new, in that large security systems always have their fair share of false positives and false negatives.

Cybersecurity consultant Brian Levine, executive director of FormerGov, said the Wall Street reaction to Anthropic’s announcement could signal that investors “are recalibrating around the idea that AI‑native security might compress or even reorder parts of the stack. Whether that’s justified or just reflexive fear of disruption, it suggests that people now believe a foundation model could meaningfully compete with, or be more helpful than, traditional detection and analysis engines.”

A different category of analysis

If Anthropic can continue to deliver, it could mean an even more fundamental shift, he noted.

“If a model can reason across sprawling codebases, correlate patterns that static tools miss, and do it continuously, that’s not incremental improvement, it may be a whole different category of analysis. It suggests a world where vulnerability discovery becomes less about signature libraries and more about adaptive interpretation,” Levine said.

But he, like Timsah, is concerned about changes in the model impacting an organization’s security posture. “That’s the tradeoff,” he said. “Unprecedented analytical power paired with a new kind of dependency that security leaders will have to evaluate with clear heads.”

A single point of trust and a single point of failure

Joshua Woodruff, CEO of MassiveScale.AI, said he found the Anthropic move problematic, but not for what it might do to other security companies. He is mostly worried about the benefits to cyber attackers.

“If Anthropic’s model found 500+ unknown high-severity vulns in open source projects, that means any attacker running a similar model can find those same vulns right now. Only no one’s reporting them. They’re exploiting them,” Woodruff said. “Vulnerability discovery just went asymmetric. Defenders get a tool that suggests patches for human review. Attackers get a tool that finds zero-days at machine speed with no review step.”

There’s another issue, he added: “If an AI agent finds the bug and suggests the fix, who’s checking the patch? You’re trusting the same model to be both auditor and repair crew. No security team would ever let the same person find the vulnerability and write the fix without some sort of independent review. But that’s exactly what happens if teams treat human review as a rubber stamp. The fix becomes the new attack surface.”

Ravid Circus, CPO at Seemplicity, agreed with Woodruff that the potential circular use of AI to both find the holes and fix them is a concern.

“When the same AI writes the code, finds the vulnerabilities, and proposes the fix, you’ve created a single point of trust and a single point of failure. Compromise that and you don’t just introduce bugs, you potentially manufacture backdoors at scale,” Circus said. “I worry we’re about to see ‘We use Claude Security’ become the new checkbox, like SOC 2 badges or Zero Trust branding. The real question isn’t which AI you use. It’s whether your organization has the operational maturity to validate and govern what it tells you. ‘Claude said we’re secure’ cannot become a security posture.”

To be sure, Anthropic has had its own issues with cybersecurity recently, but few disagreed that what it has been delivering for code examination is impressive. The question is whether it will ultimately deliver better pricing, scalability, and reliability than existing partners, and how soon this could occur.

In fact, another cyber executive, Gadi Evton, CEO of Knostic, argues that because the speed of innovation is moving far faster than most in the industry have ever seen, some organizations may not be re-evaluating AI offerings often enough.

“It is moving so fast. People who tried [Anthropic’s offering] two months ago don’t understand how well it works now,” Evton said.

And, said Rock Lambros, director of AI security at Zenity, “as long as genAI remains non-deterministic, secure-at-generation will always have gaps and you’ll always need post-generation validation for something that can’t guarantee the same output twice. The real problem is that nobody is staffed, funded, or even scoped to govern the autonomous systems that are already deployed.”

Kommerzielle OT-Security-Lösungen können hohe Kosten verursachen. Lesen Sie, welche Alternativen es gibt.

MY STOCKERS – Shutterstock.com

OT-Security als strategischer Erfolgsfaktor

Die zunehmende Digitalisierung und Vernetzung in der industriellen Produktion haben OT-Security (Operational Technology-Sicherheit) zu einem Kernthema in Unternehmen gemacht. Produktionsdaten, SCADA-Systeme (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) und vernetzte Maschinen sind in vielen Branchen essenziell  – und äußerst anfällig für Cyberangriffe. Ein Zwischenfall kann nicht nur zu Produktionsausfällen und Imageschäden, sondern auch zu lebensbedrohlichen Situationen führen, etwa in kritischen Infrastrukturen (KRITIS).

Gleichzeitig steigen die Budget– und Kostendruck-Szenarien: Handelszölle, drohende Kurzarbeit oder wirtschaftliche Unsicherheiten erschweren hohe Investitionen in teure OT-Security-Lösungen. Entsprechend rückt die Frage nach kosteneffizienten Alternativen in den Vordergrund.

OT-Security auf höchstem Niveau – dank Open-Source-Alternativen

Kommerzielle OT-Security-Lösungen wie jene von Nozomi Networks, Darktrace, Forescout oder Microsoft Defender for IoT versprechen einen großen Funktionsumfang, gehen jedoch nicht selten mit Lizenzkosten in mittlerer bis hoher sechsstelliger Eurohöhe pro Jahr einher. Vor allem in wirtschaftlich angespannten Zeiten ist eine solch hohe Investition intern oft schwer zu rechtfertigen.

Demgegenüber bieten Open-Source-Tools einige entscheidende Vorteile:

Geringere Kosten: Keine Lizenzgebühren, lediglich Investitionen in Hardware und Implementierung.

Flexibilität und Anpassbarkeit: Quellcode ist frei verfügbar und kann an spezifische Anforderungen im OT-Umfeld angepasst werden.

Aktive Community: Kontinuierliche Weiterentwicklung und schnelle Reaktion auf neuartige Bedrohungen.

Allerdings erfordern Open-Source-Lösungen in der Regel ein gut aufgestelltes IT-/OT-Security-Team, das diese Tools korrekt implementiert, konfiguriert und betreibt. Auch der Support ist eher “Community-driven” oder erfolgt über spezialisierte Dienstleister. Dennoch zeigt die Praxis: Eine professionelle Planung ermöglicht ein Sicherheitsniveau, das in vielen Belangen mit dem teurer Anbieter mithalten kann.

Empfohlene Open-Source-Tool-Kombinationen für maximale Abdeckung

Um einen möglichst großen Teil der Sicherheitsfunktionen abzudecken, empfiehlt sich eine Kombination mehrerer Open-Source-Tools. Diese lassen sich modular erweitern, was eine bessere Anpassung an die jeweilige OT-Landschaft ermöglicht.

Dazu folgende Beispiele:

Asset Management & Netzwerktransparenz

Fokus: Echtzeit-Netzwerkanalyse und spezialisierte OT-Protokollunterstützung

Deep Packet Inspection, umfassende Protokollanalysen (unter anderem Modbus und DNP3)

Kontinuierliche Asset Discovery durch passives Monitoring

Speziell für ICS/SCADA-Umgebungen konzipiert

Ergänzung: GRASSMARLIN für Netzwerkvisualisierung

Stellt Topologien in industriellen Umgebungen grafisch dar

Hilft bei der Identifizierung unbekannter Netzwerkwege und Segmentierungsproblemen

Fokus: IP-Adressmanagement und umfangreiche OT-Asset-Dokumentation

Zentrale Inventarisierung und “Single Source of Truth” für Netzwerkinfrastrukturen

Einfache Integration in CMDB-Prozesse

Essenzielle Grundlage für weitere Sicherheitsmaßnahmen wie Segmentierung, Netzwerkzugriffs-Kontrollen.

Netzwerküberwachung & Anomalieerkennung

Security Onion (Suricata + Zeek)

Fokus: Echtzeit-Bedrohungserkennung, Netzwerkforensik

Bietet IDS/IPS-Funktionalitäten (Suricata oder Snort) und Protokollanalyse (Zeek) in einem umfassenden Paket

Integrierte Dashboards (zum Beispiel Kibana) für Alarmierung und Auswertung

Leicht skalierbar von kleinen Test-Setups bis hin zu großen Produktionsstandorten

2. ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)

Fokus: Zentrale Logging- und Visualisierungsplattform

Leistungsstarke Such- und Analysemöglichkeiten für Logdaten

Langzeit-Analysen und Korrelation von Events aus unterschiedlichen Quellen

Flexible Dashboards für Security-Verantwortliche

Schwachstellenmanagement & Endpoint-Security

Fokus: XDR (Extended Detection and Response), Compliance und Schwachstellenmanagement

Zentrale Überwachung von Endgeräten (HMIs, SCADA-Server, Operator Stations etc.)

File Integrity Monitoring und aktive Erkennung von Sicherheitsvorfällen

Compliance-Unterstützung (zum Beispiel TISAX, ITAR, PCI-DSS)

2. OpenVAS (Greenbone Vulnerability Manager)

Fokus: Aktive Schwachstellenscans zur Identifikation potenzieller Lücken

Regelmäßig aktualisierte Datenbank mit bekannten Schwachstellen

Ergänzt passives Monitoring mit aktiven Scan-Funktionen

Deckt ein breites Spektrum an Systemen ab

Incident Response & Security Operations

Fokus: Incident-Management, Case-Verwaltung, Workflow-Automatisierung

Integration vordefinierter oder eigener IR-Playbooks

Analyse-Module (Cortex) ermöglichen automatische Abfragen von IoCs oder Bedrohungsfeeds

Fokus: Threat Intelligence Management, Integration externer Feeds

Zentrale Sammlung, Korrelation und Analyse von Bedrohungsinformationen

Unterstützung bei proaktiven Verteidigungsmaßnahmen

Perfekte Ergänzung zu Sicherheitsdaten aus Security Onion, Wazuh & Co.

Weitere Ergänzungen für ein vollumfängliches OT-Security-Konzept

ICS-spezifische Honeypots (z. B. Conpot): Dienen als “Frühwarnsystem” und ermöglichen Einblicke in Angriffsstrategien, bevor die echten Produktionssysteme betroffen sind.

OT-spezifische Machine-Learning-Projekte: Wer mehr KI-Funktionalität möchte, kann auf PyTorch, TensorFlow oder spezialisierte Forschungsprojekte setzen. Allerdings ist dafür oft umfassendes Data-Science-Know-how erforderlich.

Regel- und Signatur-Packs: Um Suricata/Zeek noch besser auf industrielle Protokolle abzustimmen, können ICS-spezifische Regeln (z. B. über Emerging Threats, Industrial Control Systems-Signaturen) eingebunden werden.

Chancen und Grenzen von Open Source

Mit den dargestellten Open-Source-Tools lässt sich ein breiter Funktionsumfang realisieren, der dem kommerzieller Lösungen erstaunlich nahekommt. Die Stärken liegen in der Kosteneffizienz, Flexibilität und Community-Unterstützung. Gleichzeitig sollte man berücksichtigen:

Kein automatisches “Plug & Play”: Anders als bei kommerziellen Lösungen muss man Zeit in Installation, Konfiguration und Feintuning investieren.

Machine-Learning-Funktionalitäten sind vorhanden (vor allem mit Suricata, Zeek und ergänzenden ML-Frameworks), erfordern jedoch oft mehr Know-how als die Out-of-the-box-Lösungen hochpreisiger Anbieter.

Support & Wartung: Statt eines dedizierten Hersteller-Supports stützt man sich meist auf eine Kombination aus Community-Foren, Dokumentationen und gegebenenfalls individuellen Dienstleistern.

Dennoch belegt die Praxis, dass mit einem kompetenten OT-Security-Team oder externen Beratern auch Open-Source-Lösungen in großem Stil erfolgreich eingesetzt werden können. (jm)

[40] CSO Online - Russian group uses AI to exploit weakly-protected Fortinet firewalls, says Amazon
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[TAM METİN - 1385 kelime]
The report warns CSOs that while AI is helping unsophisticated threat actors, failure to implement cybersecurity basics is fatal regardless of the attacker's skill.

A Russian-speaking threat actor is using commercial generative AI services to compromise hundreds of Fortinet Fortigate firewalls, warns Amazon Threat Intelligence.

Once on the network, the hackers successfully compromised Active Directory at hundreds of organizations, extracted complete credential databases, and targeted backup infrastructure — a potential precursor to ransomware deployment, the report adds.

The report, by CJ Moses, CISO of Amazon Integrated Security, is another signal that commercial AI services are lowering the technical barrier to entry for offensive cyber capabilities.

A single actor, or a very small group, generated its entire toolkit through AI-assisted development, Amazon says.

But the report is also a reminder to CSOs and IT leaders of all organizations of something they have known for decades: Failure to implement cybersecurity basics will inevitably lead to a breach of security controls. The compromised Fortigate firewalls in this campaign are being exploited not through product flaws, but through exposed management ports and weak credentials with only single-factor authentication. A primary tool was the use of a list of commonly reused credentials, otherwise known as a brute-force attack. These were “fundamental security gaps” that allowed AI to help an unsophisticated actor exploit at scale, the Amazon report says.

“When this actor encountered hardened environments or more sophisticated defensive measures, they simply moved on to softer targets rather than persisting,” says the report.

“Strong defensive fundamentals remain the most effective countermeasure,” for similar attacks, Amazon stresses. This includes patch management for perimeter devices, credential hygiene, network segmentation, and robust detection of post-exploitation indicators.

Jeff Pollard, a principle analyst at Forrester Research who leads research into the role of the CSO, noted that, unlike many other recent attacks on Fortinet, this campaign has to do with the configuration of the devices, not software vulnerabilities in the platform itself.

“It’s a case of needing to follow the basics and, if anything, makes those basics more important,” he said. “What’s more interesting than the attack itself is the evidence that attackers used AI platforms to scale the attack to make it as far reaching as they did.

“AI will do more than surface novel attacks,” he added. “It will also amplify the impact of all attacks, as this attack demonstrates. It lowers the barrier of entry to attackers and also ups the potential consequences of attacks at the same time. That’s not a combination IT, developers, or security practitioners needed, but alas, here we are.”

The Amazon report comes on the heels of one from Palo Alto Networks that looked at 750 incidents and came to the same conclusion:  what is really killing organizations isn’t so much AI, but their basic security failings such as weak authentication, a lack of real-time visibility, and misconfigurations caused by a complex sprawl of security systems.

Amazon Threat Intelligence found that the Russian-speaking threat actor had been able to compromise over 600 FortiGate devices across more than 55 countries between January 11 and  February 18, all without exploiting any vulnerabilities. Instead it used unnamed commercial AI services, excluding AWS, to hack into weakly-protected FortiGate devices. AI just helped scale the attack.

“The threat actor in this campaign is not known to be associated with any advanced persistent threat group with state-sponsored resources,” the report says. “They are likely a financially motivated individual or small group who, through AI augmentation, achieved an operational scale that would have previously required a significantly larger and more skilled team.”

The gang also isn’t (or perhaps until now, wasn’t) smart: It left operational files including AI-generated attack plans, victim configurations, and source code for custom tooling on the publicly-accessible IT infrastructure that was hosting its attacks.

“It’s like an AI-powered assembly line for cybercrime, helping less skilled workers produce at scale,” Amazon researchers said.

After stealing admin credentials, firewall policies, network topology, and routing information, as well as IPsec VPN peer configurations, the threat actor used AI-assisted Python scripts to parse, decrypt, and organize these stolen configurations.

Following achieving VPN access to victim networks, Amazon says the threat actor deploys a custom network reconnaissance tool, with different versions written in both Go and Python. Analysis of the source code reveals clear indicators of AI-assisted development such as redundant comments that merely restate function names, simplistic architecture with disproportionate investment in formatting over functionality, naive JSON parsing via string matching rather than proper deserialization, and compatibility shims for language built-ins with empty documentation stubs. While functional for the threat actor’s specific use case, the tooling lacks robustness and fails under edge cases, characteristics, Amazon says, typical of AI-generated code used without significant refinement.

The Amazon report makes a number of recommendations to network admins with FortiGate devices. They include ensuring device management interfaces aren’t exposed to the internet, or, if they have to be, restricting access to known IP ranges and using a bastion host or out-of-band management network. As basic cybersecurity demands, all default and common credentials for FortiGate appliances should be changed. They should ensure multifactor authentication is implemented for all admin and VPN access, and make sure there is no password reuse between FortiGate VPN credentials and Active Directory domain accounts.

To avoid their systems being exploited, IT admins in firms using AWS are advised to enable Amazon GuardDuty for threat detection, monitoring for unusual API calls and credential usage patterns, use Amazon Inspector to automatically scan for software vulnerabilities and unintended network exposure, and use AWS Security Hub to maintain continuous visibility into their security posture.

Fernando Montenegro, cybersecurity practice lead at Futurum, said organizations are still coming to terms with the acceleration and augmentation that AI can bring to adversaries. In this case, he said, the threat researchers highlighted how adversaries likely leveraged AI capabilities to create crude but effective tools to support their campaign. This is the same kind of capability that allows a non-malicious user to ‘vibe code’ something for a narrow use case, but instead of a benign app, it’s a malicious tool.

Raises the bar for security

Organizations always deal with constraints that are not visible to outside observers, so ‘implementing security basics’ may, in many cases, not be a simple endeavor, he added. Most security teams deal with numerous competing priorities and limited budgets, and must constantly balance a mixture of new-initiative and steady-state operational activities.

“What this incident, and others, are making abundantly clear is that the augmentation of attackers through AI is constantly and quickly raising the bar in what is considered acceptable security practices moving forward,” he also said. “This will require organizations to spend more cycles making sure that these weaker security practices be quickly removed from their environment, lest they fall prey to nimble(r) attackers.”

In a LinkedIn blog, Amazon CISO Moses noted that organizations with strong credential hygiene, MFA, and proper network segmentation successfully blocked these attacks. “And while AI is lowering the barrier to entry for attackers,” he added, “it’s an equally powerful tool for defenders, helping security teams detect threats faster, automate response at scale, and stay ahead of evolving tactics. As attack volumes grow from both skilled and unskilled adversaries, the same defensive basics that protected against this campaign will remain your most effective countermeasure.”

In response to questions from CSO, he added that the Russian group’s success “fundamentally demonstrates that threat actors often choose the path of least resistance. When basic security controls like multi-factor authentication, proper network segmentation, and credential management aren’t in place, even unsophisticated actors can achieve strategic objectives at scale. The AI simply amplified their efficiency.”

Asked why IT leaders are still unable to implement cybersecurity basics, he said, “The challenge isn’t knowledge, it’s operating in resource-constrained environments where technical debt and competing business priorities create systematic gaps in foundational security. Legacy systems, budget constraints, and rapid digital transformation often force difficult trade-offs, but threat actors are now leveraging AI to exploit these exact vulnerabilities at machine speed. The path forward requires making security fundamentals so embedded that they become operationally resilient, even under resource pressure.”

Die RTL Group wurde offenbar Opfer einer Cyberattacke. Wie Cybernews berichtet, brüstet sich ein Cyberkrimineller namens LuneBF mit gestohlenen Daten von mehr als 27.000 Mitarbeitern der Mediengruppe. In seinem Darknet-Post behauptet der Angreifer, sich Zugriff auf die Intranet-Website der RTL Group verschafft zu haben.

Als Beweis für den Angriff stellt er eine Stichprobe mit 100 Datensätzen zur Verfügung, die Mitarbeiter der RTL Group und ihrer Tochtergesellschaften wie Fremantle und M6 betreffen soll. Zu den geleakten Informationen zählen demnach vollständige Namen, E-Mail-Adressen, arbeitsplatzbezogene Postadressen sowie private und beruflich genutzte Rufnummern.

Keine Kundendaten betroffen

Der Medienkonzern hat den Vorfall gegenüber Cybernews bestätigt. „Nach unserem aktuellen Kenntnisstand ist es unwahrscheinlich, dass Kundendaten betroffen sind“, erklärte ein Sprecher. Die Untersuchung sei jedoch noch nicht abgeschlossen. Weitere Details zu dem Angriff gibt es bisher nicht.

Warnung vor Angriffsfolgen

Security-Experten warnen nun davor, dass das Leck massive Folgen für die dort beschäftigten Journalisten haben könnte. Mit den gestohlenen Kontaktdaten ließen sich zum Beispiel gezielte Phishing- oder Social-Engineering-Attacken durchführen. Noch schlimmer: Investigativjournalisten, die zu kritischen Themen recherchieren, könnten ins Visier von staatlichen oder kriminellen Akteuren geraten. Ein erfolgreicher Angriff auf ihre Geräte könnte Quellen enttarnen, unveröffentlichtes Material gefährden und laufende Recherchen behindern.

[42] CSO Online - New Arkanix stealer blends rapid Python harvesting with stealthier C++ payloads

The Arkanix infostealer combines LLM-assisted development with a malware-as-a-service model, using dual language implementations to maximize reach and establish persistence.

A newly uncovered infostealer, suspected to be built with the help of a large language model, is targeting victims with Python and C++ variants, each tailored for a different stage of data theft. Kaspersky researchers discovered a stealer dubbed “Arkanix,” which is capable of harvesting credentials, browser data, cryptocurrency, and banking assets from infected machines.

“It collects a vast amount of information, including highly sensitive personal data,” Kaspersky researchers said in a Securelist blog post. “While being quite functional, it contains probable traces of LLM-assisted development, which suggests that such assistance might have drastically reduced development time and costs.”

Arkanix operates a MaaS model, allowing malicious actors to buy access to the malware as well as a control panel featuring configurable payloads and statistics. Turning to AI assistance, researchers noted, signals that the attackers are after a one-shot campaign for quick financial gains rather than a long-running infection.

A heavily-marketed dual-language malware

The native (C++) version of the stealer also uses a designated domain as C2, although some observed test samples collected used a Discord bot instead. Additionally, it includes extensive logging for debugging and implements analysis countermeasures such as ensuring that the application isn’t being run within a sandbox or under a debugger.

The disclosure noted heavy promotion of the Stealer in underground spaces, using extensive marketing materials, feature lists, and supporting infrastructure. While not unseen with MaaS models, such overt marketing of the malware aligns with the researchers’ understanding of the campaign being a one-off operation for a quick turnaround.

But some parts of the analysis suggest otherwise.

The stealer employs a broad data-theft toolkit

The researchers noted that the Python implementation acts as a wide-net data harvester. It collects system information, extracts browser-stored data, and pulls details from communication platforms, including Telegram and Discord. Additional modules target VPN configurations, retrieve selected files from the host, and can deliver other payloads, suggesting the Python build is designed to gather a comprehensive snapshot of a victim machine while enabling flexible follow-up actions.

By contrast, the C++ variant concentrates on assets that enable persistence, lateral movement, or monetization beyond simple credential theft. The researchers found capabilities related to remote desktop protocol (RDP) connections, the collection of gaming-related files, and screen capture functionality. It also includes a post-exploitation browser data extractor, “ChromElevator.”

While the Python version aligns with the researchers’ theory of a grab-and-run approach, the C++ version does hint at plans for persistence. The disclosure added a list of indicators of compromise (IOCs), including file hashes, IPs, and domains, to support detection efforts.

[43] CSO Online - Attackers exploit Ivanti EPMM zero-days to seize control of MDM servers
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Tarih: Mon, 23 Feb 2026 10:32:31 +0000
Link: https://www.csoonline.com/article/4135776/attackers-exploit-ivanti-epmm-zero-days-to-seize-control-of-mdm-servers.html

[TAM METİN - 786 kelime]
Palo Alto Networks’ Unit 42 says two critical flaws are being actively abused to gain unauthenticated access, deploy persistent backdoors, and compromise entire enterprise mobile fleets even after patches are applied.

Attackers are actively exploiting two critical zero-day vulnerabilities in Ivanti’s Endpoint Manager Mobile (EPMM) to gain unauthenticated control of enterprise mobile device management infrastructure and install backdoors engineered to persist even after organizations apply available patches.

“Two critical zero-day vulnerabilities (CVE-2026-1281 and CVE-2026-1340) affecting Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile (EPMM) are being actively exploited in the wild, affecting enterprise mobile fleets and corporate networks,” Palo Alto Networks’ Unit 42 threat research team said in an advisory. “These vulnerabilities allow unauthenticated attackers to remotely execute arbitrary code on target servers, granting them full control over mobile device management (MDM) infrastructure without requiring user interaction or credentials.”

EPMM, formerly known as MobileIron Core, is a mobile device management platform that enterprises use to manage and enforce security policies on employee smartphones and tablets.

Palo Alto Networks’ attack surface management platform Cortex Xpanse found more than 4,400 EPMM instances currently exposed on the public internet. Compromise of the platform gives attackers access to device policies, credentials, and metadata across an organization’s entire mobile fleet, Unit 42 warned in the advisory.

Both vulnerabilities carry a CVSS score of 9.8 and allow unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary commands on exposed EPMM servers without any user interaction or valid credentials.

Ivanti acknowledged the attacks when it released emergency patches in late January, but described the initial impact as limited. “We are aware of a very limited number of customers whose solution has been exploited at the time of disclosure,” the company said in its security advisory.

Both vulnerabilities stem from unsafe Bash script handling in legacy Apache web server configurations, according to Unit 42. CVE-2026-1281 targets the In-House Application Distribution feature; CVE-2026-1340 exploits the same flaw class through a separate script handling the Android File Transfer mechanism. “Although the root cause is the same, they reside in two distinct scripts handling different features,” the advisory explained.

From scan to backdoor

Unit 42 documented threat actors moving rapidly from automated scanning to initial access and then escalating quickly to deploy persistent backdoors designed to outlast patching cycles.

After gaining initial access, attackers immediately attempted to download and execute a second-stage payload. “This second stage typically installs a web shell, a cryptominer, or a persistent backdoor to grant the attacker control of the appliance,” the advisory said.

Unit 42 also said attackers deployed the Nezha open-source monitoring agent to maintain visibility over compromised systems.

The attackers targeted sectors including state and local government, healthcare, manufacturing, professional services, and high technology across the United States, Germany, Australia, and Canada, the advisory added.

Unit 42 also warned that proof-of-concept exploit code for both CVEs is already publicly available, making broader exploitation likely as more threat actors adopt working exploits.

Patch, but verify first

Unit 42 directed organizations to Ivanti’s security advisory for remediation guidance, which recommends applying version-specific RPM patches for EPMM 12.x branches that require no appliance downtime. Ivanti cautioned, however, that the patch does not survive a version upgrade and must be reinstalled if the software is updated. “The permanent fix for this vulnerability will be included in the next product release: 12.8.0.0 expected in Q1 2026.’

Ivanti also warned in its advisory that while its Sentry mobile traffic gateway is not directly vulnerable, EPMM holds command execution permissions on connected Sentry systems.”If an EPMM deployment has been compromised, the attackers might have compromised Ivanti Sentry as well,” Ivanti warned.

For organizations that suspect compromise, the Ivanti advisory suggested against attempting to clean affected systems. Instead, it recommended restoring from a known-good backup or performing a full rebuild, followed by a complete reset of all account passwords, service credentials, and public certificates. With proof-of-concept exploit code already publicly available for both CVEs, broader exploitation is expected as more threat actors adopt working exploits.

The targeting of EPMM follows a pattern that will be familiar to Ivanti customers. The product has been exploited at scale before — in 2023, state-sponsored attackers used EPMM zero-days to break into Norwegian government networks, and separate flaws were again exploited in the wild last year.

Ivanti’s Connect Secure VPN product has had a similarly troubled record, with Chinese APT groups exploiting zero-days in back-to-back campaigns that eventually led the US government to order federal agencies to disconnect Ivanti VPN products entirely in February 2024.

[TAM METİN - 2438 kelime]
Cybercriminals are increasingly exploiting gen AI technologies to enhance the sophistication and efficiency of their attacks.

Artificial intelligence is revolutionizing the technology industry and this is equally true for the cybercrime ecosystem, as cybercriminals are increasingly leveraging generative AI to improve their tactics, techniques, and procedures and deliver faster, stronger, and sneakier attacks.

As with legitimate use of emerging AI tools, abuse of generative AI for nefarious ends thus far hasn’t been so much about the novel and unseen as it has been about productivity and efficiency, lowering the barrier to entry, and offloading automatable tasks in favor of higher-order thinking on the part of the humans involved.

“AI doesn’t necessarily result in new types of cybercrimes, and instead enables the means to accelerate or scale existing crimes we are familiar with, as well as introduce new threat vectors,” Dr. Peter Garraghan, CEO/CTO of AI security testing vendor Mindgard and a professor at the UK’s Lancaster University, tells CSO. “If a legitimate user can find utility in using AI to automate their tasks, capture complex patterns, lower the barrier of technical entry, reduced costs, and generate new content, why wouldn’t a criminal do the same?”

But the advent of agentic AI is beginning to change things, with AI tools no longer just assisting attackers but helping them automate operations.

“The most significant shift over the past year has been AI’s evolution from a simple ‘helper’ toward becoming a fully autonomous, and quite literally an attacker’s partner-in-crime, capable of executing entire attack chains,” says Crystal Morin, senior cybersecurity strategist at cloud-native security and visibility vendor Sysdig.

Here is a look at various ways cybercriminals are putting gen AI to use in exploiting enterprise systems today.

Taking phishing to the next level

Gen AI enables the creation of highly convincing phishing emails, greatly increasingly the likelihood of prospective marks giving over sensitive information to scam sites or downloading malware.

Instead of sending generic, unconvincing, and error-ridden emails, cybercriminals can leverage AI to quickly generate more sophisticated, personalized, and legitimate-looking emails to target specific recipients.

Gen AI tools help enrich phishing campaigns by pulling together wide-ranging sources of data, including targeted information gleaned from social media.

“AI can be used to quickly learn what types of emails are being rejected or opened, and in turn modify its approach to increase phishing success rate,” Mindgard’s Garraghan explains.

Facilitating malware development

AI can also be used to generate more sophisticated — or less labour-intensive — malware.

For example, cybercriminals are using gen AI to create malicious HTML documents. The XWorm attack, initiated by HTML smuggling, which contains malicious code that downloads and runs the malware, bears the hallmarks of development via AI.

“The loader’s detailed line-by-line description suggesting it was crafted using generative AI,” according to HP Wolf Security’s 2025 Threat Insights Report.

In addition, the “design of the HTML webpage delivering XWorm is almost visually identical as the output from ChatGPT 4o after prompting the LLM to generate an HTML page that offers a file download,” HP Wolf Security added in its report.

Elsewhere, ransomware group FunkSec — an Algeria-linked ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operator that takes advantage of double-extortion tactics — has begun harnessing AI technologies, according to Check Point Research.

“FunkSec operators appear to use AI-assisted malware development, which can enable even inexperienced actors to quickly produce and refine advanced tools,” Check Point researchers wrote in a blog post.

Accelerating vulnerability hunting and exploits

Analyzing systems for vulnerabilities and developing exploits can also be simplified through use of gen AI.

“Instead of a black hat hacker spending the time to probe and perform reconnaissance against a system perimeter, an AI agent can be tasked to do this automatically,” Mingard’s Garraghan says.

Gen AI may be behind a 62% reduction in the time between a vulnerability being discovered and its exploitation by attackers from 47 days to just 18 days, according to a study last year by threat intelligence firm ReliaQuest.

“This sharp decrease strongly indicates that a major technological advancement — likely gen AI — is enabling threat actors to exploit vulnerabilities at unprecedented speeds,” ReliaQuest wrote.

Adversaries are leveraging gen AI alongside pen-testing tools to write scripts for tasks such as network scanning, privilege escalation, and payload customization. AI is also likely being used by cybercriminals to analyze scan results and suggest optimal exploits, allowing them to identify flaws in victim systems faster.

“These advances accelerate many phases in the kill chain, particularly initial access,” ReliaQuest concluded.

Cyber resilience firm Cybermindr used a different methodology to find that the average time to exploit a vulnerability had fallen to five days in 2025. “AI-driven reconnaissance, automated attack scripts, and underground exploit marketplaces have accelerated the weaponization of vulnerabilities,” it said.

CSO’s Lucian Constantin offers a deeper look at how generative AI tools are transforming the cyber threat landscape by democratizing vulnerability hunting for pen-testers and attackers alike.

Launching AI-orchestrated espionage

Anthropic dropped a bombshell in September 2025 when it revealed that it had disrupted a sophisticated AI-orchestrated cyber espionage campaign.

The attackers abused Claude Code to automate approximately 80% of their campaign activities, targeting around 30 major tech firms, financial institutions, and government agencies.

In a “small number of cases” attacks were successful, according to the AI company, noting that an unnamed “Chinese state-sponsored group” was likely behind the campaign, which relied on jailbreaking tools to make prohibited functions possible.

Last year Carnegie Mellon’s CyLab Security & Privacy Institute researchers, in collaboration with Anthropic, demonstrated that LLMs like GPT-4o can autonomously plan and execute sophisticated cyberattacks on enterprise-scale networks — without any human intervention.

“The study reveals that an LLM, when structured with high-level planning capabilities and supported by specialized agent frameworks, can simulate network intrusions and closely mirror real-world breaches,” a CyLab spokesperson explained.

Escalating threats with alternative platforms

Cybercriminals have also begun developing their own large language models (LLMs) — such as WormGPT, FraudGPT, DarkBERT, and others — built without the guardrails that constrain criminals’ misuse of mainstream gen AI platforms.

These platforms are commonly harnessed for applications such as phishing and malware generation.

Moreover, mainstream LLMs can also be customized for targeted use. Security researcher Chris Kubecka shared with CSO in late 2024 how her custom version of ChatGPT, called Zero Day GPT, helped her identify more than 20 zero-days in a matter of months.

Stealing resources via LLMjacking

Threat actors are also busy stealing cloud credentials specifically to hijack costly LLM resources, either for their own gain or to sell access, in an attack technique called LLMjacking.

“Beyond theft of service, attackers are now actively probing newer LLM models to identify those that lack the guardrails of more mature platforms, effectively using them as unrestricted sandboxes to generate malicious code or bypass regional sanctions,” Sysdig’s Morin reports.

Creating a Silk Road–style marketplace for AI agents

Beyond AI agents executing individual attacks, security experts are beginning to track examples where coordination itself is being automated or orchestrated.

“We’re seeing early experiments where multiple specialized agents interact, some focused on reconnaissance, others on tooling, execution, or data movement, without any single agent needing the full picture,” says Lucie Cardiet, cyberthreat research manager at Vectra AI.

A concrete example of this is Molt Road, which offers a dark-web-style marketplace for AI agents, albeit one with few listings at present.

“Autonomous agents can create listings, sell access or capabilities, coordinate tasks, and complete transactions with minimal human involvement, effectively automating the economics of cybercrime,” Cardiet tells CSO.

“We can expect attackers to actively leverage this model in the coming months, breaking the attack chain into specialized, cooperating agents to speed up and scale their attacks,” she says.

Breaking in with authentication bypass

Gen AI tools can also be abused to bypass security defences such as CAPTCHAs or biometric authentication.

“AI can defeat CAPTCHA systems and analyse voice biometrics to compromise authentication,” according to cybersecurity vendor Dispersive. “This capability underscores the need for organizations to adopt more advanced, layered security measures.”

Leveraging deepfakes for social engineering

AI-generated deepfakes are being abused to exploit channels many employees more implicitly trust, such as voice and video, instead of relying on less convincing email-based attacks.

The problem is becoming more severe with the wider availability of AI technologies capable of creating more convincing deepfakes, according to Alex Lisle, CTO of deepfake detection platform Reality Defender.

“There was a recent case involving a cybersecurity company that relied on visual verification for credential resets,” Lisle says. “Their process required a manager to join a Zoom call with IT to confirm an employee’s identity before a password reset.”

Lisle explains: “Attackers are now leveraging deepfakes to impersonate those managers on live video calls to authorize these resets.”

In the most high-profile example to date, a finance worker at design and engineering company Arup was tricked into authorizing a fraudulent HK$200 million ($25.6 million) transaction after attending a videoconference call during which fraudsters used deepfake technology to impersonate its UK-based CFO.

Impersonating brands in malicious ad campaigns

Cybercriminals have begun using gen AI tools to deliver brand impersonation campaigns delivered via ads and content platforms, rather than traditional phishing or malware.

“Attackers now use gen AI to mass-produce realistic ad copy, creatives, and fake support pages, then distribute them across search ads, social ads, and AI-generated content, targeting high-intent queries like ‘brand login’ or ‘brand support,’” explains Shlomi Beer, co-founder and CEO at ImpersonAlly, a security startup that specializes in protecting the online advertising ecosystem.

The tactic was used in ongoing a series of Google Ad account fraud, to impersonate the Cursor AI coding assistant firm, and in a fake Shopify ecommerce platform customer support scam, among other attacks.

Attackers have also begun targeting viral personal AI agents such as OpenClaw.

OpenClaw offers an open-source AI agent framework. A combination of supply chain attacks on its skill marketplace and misconfigurations open the door to potential exploits and malware slinging, as CSO covered in much more depth in our earlier report.

“Cybercriminals can exploit these virtual assistants to steal private keys to cryptocurrency wallets and execute code on victims’ devices,” says Edward Wu, CEO and founder at Dropzone AI. “We can expect 2026 to be the year when security teams will try to prevent unsanctioned usage of personal AI agents.”

Poisoning model memories

To offer short-term and longer-term context, AI agents are starting to rely more on persistent memory, opening the door for exploits that involve planting malicious memories.

If an attacker injects malicious or false information into an agent’s memory, that corrupted context then influences every future decision the agent makes.

For example, security researcher Johann Rehberger showed how he could plant false memories in ChatGPT in September 2025.

“He [Rehberger] used a malicious image with hidden instructions embedded in it to inject fabricated data into the model’s long-term memory,” said Siri Varma Vegiraju, security tech lead at Microsoft. “The scary part was that once the memory was poisoned, it persisted across sessions and continuously exfiltrated user data to a server the attacker controlled.”

Hacking AI infrastructure

Over the past year, attackers have shifted from using generative AI to targeting the infrastructure that enables it.

This vector of attack is exemplified in the supply chain poisoning in Model Context Protocol servers, where compromised dependencies or modified code introduced vulnerabilities into enterprise environments.

For example, a counterfeit “Postmark MCP Server” discovered in early 2025 silently BCC’d all processed emails, including internal documents, invoices, and credentials, to an attacker-controlled domain.

Many other malicious MCP servers have already been identified in the wild, many designed to exfiltrate information without detection, according to Casey Bleeker CEO at SurePath AI.

“We’re tracking several categories of MCP-specific risk: tool poisoning attacks, where adversaries inject malicious instructions into AI tool descriptions that execute when the agent invokes them; supply chain compromises, where a trusted MCP server or dependency is updated post-approval to behave maliciously; and cross-tool data exfiltration, where compromised components in an agentic workflow silently siphon sensitive data through what looks like legitimate AI activity,” Bleeker explains.

AI technologies are powerful but they have their limitations, several experts tell CSO.

Rik Ferguson, VP of security intelligence at Forescout, says cybercriminals are largely relying on AI to automate repetitive tasks rather than more complex work, such as vulnerability exploitation.

“The most reliable criminal use [of AI] remains in language-heavy and workflow-heavy tasks such as phishing and pretexting, influence and outreach, triaging and contextualizing vulnerabilities, and generating boilerplate components, rather than reliably discovering and exploiting brand-new vulnerabilities end-to-end,” Ferguson says.

Over the past twelve months, managed detection and response firm Huntress has tracked threat actors applying AI to generate and automate traditional tradecraft, from developing scripts to browser extensions and, in some cases, even phishing lures.

“We have also seen such ‘vibe coded’ scripts fail to execute and meet their objectives on multiple occasions,” Anton Ovrutsky, principal tactical response analyst at Huntress, tells CSO.

And while AI has certainly given threat actors a powerful tool it has, at least to date, failed to spawn any new tactics or exploit classes, according to Ovrutsky.

“A threat actor can indeed rapidly prototype a sophisticated credential theft script, yet the basic ‘laws of physics’ still exist; a threat actor must be in a position to execute such a script in the first place,” Ovrutsky says. “We have yet to observe an exploit path that has been enabled through AI-use exclusively.”

Collectively the misuse of gen AI tools is making it easier for less skilled cybercriminals to earn a dishonest living. Defending against the attack vector challenges security professionals to harness the power of artificial intelligence more effectively than attackers.

“Criminal misuse of AI technologies is driving the necessity to test, detect, and respond to these threats, in which AI is also being leveraged to combat cybercriminal activity,” Mindgard’s Garraghan says.

In a blog post, Lawrence Pingree, VP of technical marketing at Dispersive, outlines preemptive cyber defenses that security professionals can take to win what he describes as an “AI ARMS (Automation, Reconnaissance, and Misinformation) race” between attackers and defenders.

“Relying on traditional detection and response mechanisms is no longer sufficient,” Pingree warns.

Alongside employee education and awareness programs, enterprises should be using AI to detect and neutralize generative AI-based threats in real-time.

Forescout’s Ferguson says CISOs should treat enterprise AI like any other high-value SaaS platform.

“Tighten identity and conditional access, minimize privileges, lock down keys, and monitor for anomalous AI/API usage and spend,” Ferguson advises.
